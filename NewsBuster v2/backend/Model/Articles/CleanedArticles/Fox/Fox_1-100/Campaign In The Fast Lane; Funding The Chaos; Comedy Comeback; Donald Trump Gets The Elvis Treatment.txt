LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Is there an age limitation on when you can stop strutting across the stage?Raymond, great to see you as always.All right, that's it for us tonight. We're going to continue to monitor what's happening in New York at the Met Gala. Not just the dresses. We should ask all the protesters, what are you wearing tonight?Jesse next.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --ANNOUNCER: Trump for Stafford and wins.(CROWD chanting "USA.")WATTERS: Trump kicks the campaign into overdrive, while Biden is stuck in neutral.(CROWD chanting)(Explosion)(CROWD shouting)WATTERS: Columbia cancels graduation, a PRIMETIME investigation into who funnels the money.ANDREW SCHULZ, COMEDIAN AND ACTOR: Dana has put more immigrants in cages than US border policies.(LAUGHTER)TONY HINCHCLIFFE, COMEDIAN AND PODCASTER: All night, he has been using the stool that Aaron Hernandez kicked out from under himself.WATTERS: The Tom Brady roast, cancel culture -- over.WILL FERRELL, ACTOR AND COMEDIAN: You'll always be remembered as Eli Manning's (bleep).WATTERS: Plus --JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: This is my first derby. Any advice?KID ROCK, SINGER: Yes, don't (bleep) it up.WATTERS: So we're six months from the finish line and only one guy is hitting the gas. Trump hit up the Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix Sunday and fans thought he was Elvis.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Trump. Thank you so much, we're voting for you.DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You better vote for me.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are voting for you. We are.TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He went to me.I am never washing this hand.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Marching down the racetrack, the former president chatted up the pit crews and met with the CEOs of McLaren and F1 and got a lot of love from the crowd.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CROWD chanting "USA.")(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: As the first car crossed the finish line, even the announcers were talking about him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER; McLaren seemed to welcome the former president of the United States into their garage before the race. The race that was meant to be about Max Stafford, but here in the checkered flag, now it is Trump for Stafford and wins the Miami Grand Prix and wins the Grand Prix for their first time in his career. Lando has landed.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That was Lando's first win. Total upset. Later, Trump claimed he was Lando's lucky charm. But 45 couldn't lay on too much charm because he was gagged.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I was in Miami this weekend and reporters were asking me questions, the same questions like you're asking me and I have to say I have a gag order and I can't speak about it. It never happened before ever.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Democrats aren't just gagging Trump, they're gagging Biden, too. While Trump is blowing past the Democrat judge's speech limits, Biden is pulling the emergency brake.NBC reporting that the Biden campaign is going to keep the president away from crowds and keep him quiet. Trump is gagged from telling the truth, but Biden is gagged from telling stories like his uncle was eaten by cannibals. They call it less is more.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FULKS: Our campaign believes in quality over quantity. We believe that these touches, these smaller things that are getting directly to the point about what is going on in the stakes of this election are going to be easier for voters to tap into.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Quality over quantity? Since when is less Biden better quality. If you like chocolate, you want the whole Hershey bar. You don't just want the Hershey Kiss. A Hershey Kiss isn't quality over quantity, it is the same chocolate.Usually when you like something, you don't want less of it. The media things hiding Biden is brilliant because his handlers can control him like a puppet.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL STEELE, MSNBC HOST: To be honest with you, Quentin, I think that's a very smart idea. I think --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For everyone.STEELE: For everyone -- for everyone. And I really -- I appreciate that approach because it is a way for the President to sort of hit with clarity, stick his points, and move on and not get lost and sidetracked.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now the media believes a puppet reading from a script has a better shot beating Trump than the real Joe Biden. The Biden campaign prefers a quiet puppet and the media agrees. And how do we know Biden is not in control of his campaign? Because no one likes to talk more than Joe Biden. But you're going to see seven-minute speeches once every three days till November 5th.An election where both politicians aren't allowed to talk. If one talks too much, he gets in trouble with staff. If another talks too much she gets thrown in jail.Not only does the media not want Biden to debate, they don't want him doing any more press conferences. They say, he should just do "The View."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, MSNBC HOST: My view is he should come on "The View" --SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Before he does a press conference.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you.PSAKI: I would say more Howard Stern, come on "The View," you know, more smart less conversations where you're having conversations about policy, but they are real ones that people have at their kitchen --(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Policy conversations with Joy Behar and Howard Stern? Really? What Jen really means is that she wants Biden to do interviews where no one will ask him why his policies aren't working.Donald Trump is running for president, Joe Biden is running scared. The pandemic is over. Dodging the press back then was safe for an 80-year-old. Dodging the press now, you look scared.Now if you can't handle Peter Doocy, how can you handle Vladimir Putin?The back to the basement strategy began after Trump started dominating Biden in the polls. Trump is up four points nationally, when RFK Jr. is on the ballot and is beating Biden in every single battleground in both the RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight averages.Biden is losing big time on all the major issues. Look at that. The economy, inflation, crime, Israel, the border. It's simple math. Trump is persuading and adding voters who used to back Joe.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICK KLEIN, ABC NEWS POLITICAL DIRECTOR: There is significant softness in the support for Joe Biden among core Democrats. In this poll, he is carrying Black voters by 61 points. Well, that sounds like a lot, but he carried them by 84 points back in 2020.Latino voters, a very slight Biden edge in this poll, but it was a 21-point advantage in the exit polls back in 2020, and among younger voters under 30, we are actually seeing Trump with a slight edge. That was a big win for Biden the last time around.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Democrats have taken their base for granted and now they're paying for it. Young Americans hate his foreign policy and they can't afford a house. Black voters tell Johnny they had more money under Trump and that Joe's too old.Hispanics don't like hearing they're oppressed and don't like being called Latinx or tacos by the First Lady, but the media says that's malarkey. Trump voters have bad taste and low standards.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think these polls are tight because Donald Trump's voters have very low standards and Joe Biden's voters have standards that are probably a little too high.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Voting for a puppet doesn't mean you have high standards, it means you have a low opinion of voters. Democrats believe you're too stupid to notice the puppet strings being pulled and just don't know what's good for them.That's exactly what this election is about. Whether you're better off than you were four years ago, or you could be bamboozled into believing you don't know the difference.Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy joins me now.So Speaker, do you think this new back to the basement strategy is going to work?KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: No, I mean, think about it for one moment. First, they put President Trump in court, he has to escape and in one weekend, he saw more voters, he walked more distance than Biden has done in the last six months.This idea to hide from people is never going to win. If he is hiding, he is not telling what he has done and it is really going to come down to who has low standards. That's what they're saying about Trump voters, you and I and everybody else in this country today.What they really are saying is they can't stand up to the real heat, they can't stand up to the topics. Who worked harder to secure the border? Who worked harder to make your economy stronger? Who worked harder to make your streets safer? The same guy that has to work so hard gets a gag order against him, but will work 24/7. I want a president that's going to work hard for me every single day of the week, not to talk less, but to work more.WATTERS: Imagine having the bully pulpit and saying I don't want to use it, you know, less is more. I mean, you can go out, you can make news like that. You could have anyone you want at the White House. You could go wherever you want. You have your own jet. You have the media behind you. They'll just parrot whatever you say.And your strategy is, you know, maybe seven minutes reading from a script and then I go back to Wilmington. What does that tell you?MCCARTHY: It tells you he can't run on his own ideas. He can't run on what he has done. But what's really, really concerning to me, on October 7th, when Israel was attacked, when the world was looking for a leader, what did Joe Biden do? He put a lid on it.He didn't even talk for seven minutes. He talked for no time. What does that do to our country? What does that do to the world? That really becomes the question.If they're saying he has to do less, is he not up to the job? Is he too old for the job? When you're going to hire somebody, are you going to say you only have to work part of the time? No, we want someone to work beyond the hours we even expect you to do and especially in a time of a crisis. We want our president able to respond.WATTERS: Yes. Both guys being gagged. One for the right, one for the wrong reasons. It's just a disgrace.Speaker McCarthy, thanks as always for joining PRIMETIME.MCCARTHY: Thank you.WATTERS: Donald Trump may be stuffed in a freezing meat locker for four days a week, but the VP race is heating up. Trump held the vice presidential audition at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend and he told AXIOS what he really thinks of them.Marco Rubio was there. He says his name is coming up a lot for vice president. Tim Scott, Trump says as a candidate, he did a good job, but as a surrogate, he is unbelievable.Senator JD Vance, Trump says, he wasn't a supporter of mine at the very beginning. He was saying things like "the guy is a total disaster." Anyways, I got to know him a little bit. As a non-politician, he has become one of the greatest senators.What about Utah Senator Mike Lee? Trump says, I love your haircut. And he's a good man, too.Marsha Blackburn. He says like an Energizer bunny. When campaigning in 2018, she would go from stop to stop the stop.Trump gave a nice nod to North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum saying this: I didn't know this. He was a supporter of mine. My two campaigns. He's a very rich man.Elise Stefanik is a very smart person. She was in Upstate New York when I met her. Little did we realize she would be such a big factor.And Congressman Byron Donalds is someone who created something very special politically. I like diversity. Diversity. I like diversity, and donors worth millions of dollars all want a piece of Byron.And then there's South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, Trump says she's "somebody that I love." She's been with me a supporter of mine, and I've been a supporter of hers for a long time.Whoever Trump chooses for VP will have to debate this woman.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Madam Vice President, Hamas has accepted a ceasefire deal.KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Shrimp and grits. You wanted to know. Shrimp and grits.REPORTER: Hamas has accepted a ceasefire deal. Your reaction?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Shrimp and grits.South Dakota governor and author of "No Going Back," Kristi Noem joins me now.All right, so Governor, here's the book.GOV. KRISTI NOEM (R-SD): Yes.WATTERS: You're going to be debating -- if you are the VP -- Kamala Harris. Now, what are you going to tell her?NOEM: Well, I've never had shrimp and grits before, that's for sure. But you know, she would -- I would actually enjoy that debate. I think that she is in too big of a job for her capacity and I think that President Trump is going to be back in the White House real soon and I've told him I'll do whatever he wants me to do to help him win.When he was in the White House, as Governor, I was on offense every day. I got the chance to solve problems for my people in South Dakota. And ever since Joe Biden has been there, all I do is be on defense and try to defend our freedoms and liberties.So this President Trump that has been so persecuted politically, I'll do everything I can to help him get back into leadership of this country.WATTERS: Now what happens if you are debating Kamala Harris and she says, well, wait a second, you shot your dog and you wrote a book about it bragging about it. How can you be vice president?NOEM: You know, that story was a choice as a mom, for safety of my children versus a dangerous dog that was killing livestock and attacking people. So this book that I've written is full of stories of my past hard decisions and I told the truth and I think that's very different than a lot of politicians that we have today.A lot of politicians --WATTERS: Do you regret telling that story? Do you feel like, oh, maybe I shouldn't have said it? Do you understand why people don't like that story?NOEM: Everybody has known that story for years. That's what most people don't realize is that in South Dakota, they've used that story to attack me and my political campaigns for years.I wanted people to know the truth. This dog was vicious. It was dangerous. It was killing livestock for the joy of it and attacking people. And I had a choice between keeping my family safe.I had little kids at the time, a very public business of inviting people out to come out and enjoy our hunting lodge in our business. And I don't pass my responsibilities off to anybody else.So that story is in the book because I want people to know that I'm honest, and that when I have difficult jobs that I take responsibility myself.WATTERS: All right, so you're standing by the dog story.NOEM: Well, I'll tell you what? It's the facts.WATTERS: Okay. That's the facts.NOEM: That's the facts, and I understand that they're attacking me for it, Jesse.WATTERS: Yes, they are.So they're also attacking you. I guess you said you met Kim Jong-un. Did you meet him?NOEM: I've been to the DMZ. I've been to North Korea. You know, people -- I don't talk about my conversations with world leaders, and so when I looked at the book, and I saw that excerpt, I decided to make the change to the content of the book and that's been done.WATTERS: So you didn't have a conversation with Kim when you were at the DMZ.NOEM: I don't have conversations about my conversations with world leaders. I've been working on policy for 30 years, Jesse.WATTERS: Okay.NOEM: And that's what most people don't remember about me is I'm old. I'm a mom. I'm a grandma.WATTERS: You're not that old.NOEM: I've got three little grandbabies.WATTERS: You're not that old. So maybe you did have a conversation with Kim --NOEM: For 30 years --WATTERS: But you don't want to talk.NOEM: I will not talk about my personal conversations with any world leaders. I just won't and I'm not going to do it.WATTERS: What have you learned from this book tour?NOEM: That I've already had these interviews, and we should be talking about what Americans care about. Americans care about how do we get our country back? And that's what this book is about.This book is a how-to guide for the American citizen, that is, how do I take my country back? What can I do? Does my voice matter? Does it matter if I show up and vote? How do I make a difference? And this -- every single chapter in his book says, yes, there is corruption in politics. Yes, money is too powerful. Yes, the consultants are lining their pockets with your money, and they don't give a rip about who gets elected, they just want to get rich.This is what the average citizen can do. It uses my past and stories and lessons learned and it tells the average citizen that when they show up, they make a difference, when they call it matters, when you send an e-mail, people sit up and pay attention.This is not the time to check out on America. This is the time to save America.We have an election coming for Donald Trump, the people that support him are people who love America. Everybody else that is in the White House right now are trying to destroy America. This is when it matters that the average citizen has a blueprint for how to do that.WATTERS: Okay, Kristi Noem, I just found out because I was so excited that you gave me a cowboy hat.NOEM: Yes.WATTERS: And then I found out you also gave Gutfeld one.NOEM: Oh my goodness.WATTERS: And now I feel like you give hats out to just anybody. I thought I was special, Governor.NOEM: You are special.WATTERS: I am special.NOEM: Now we've upped the game. Now you need a pair of cowboy boots.WATTERS: Now I need boots. Thank you very much, Governor.NOEM: Thank you, Jesse.WATTERS: Good luck.NOEM: You bet.WATTERS: Johnny goes to the Kentucky Derby.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: What is doing the derby mean to you?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We don't do the derby, the horses do the derby. All we can do is bet on the horses. Duh.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Fox News Alert: Arrests being made outside the Met Gala minutes ago as pro-Hamas protesters are clashing with cops.A new investigation revealing major Biden donors have been bankrolling the Arab Spring Break movement. You heard that right. Democrat dark money is fueling college riots backing Hamas terrorists. I guess that's why the FBI suddenly says they don't monitor protests.The funders are George Soros, David Rockefeller, Jr, Susan and Nick Pritzker. You know, the Chicago family behind the Hyatt Hotels. These mysterious mega donors have now been unmasked and are fair game.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP" The protests are backed by Biden's donors. Okay, are you listening, Israel? I hope you are listening, Israel. I hope you're getting smart. But they're backed by Biden donors. That's where the money is coming from.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Some of these donations track back to foreign countries. For instance, the People's Forum, which has ties to the Chinese Communist Party and gets millions of dollars from Goldman Sachs spearheaded the protests here in Manhattan.Left -wing organizations like this one trained college students for months before the riots. They even trained them in self-defense tactics to defeat riot police.One professional protester who was arrested inside Columbia's Hamilton Hall, was a 40-year-old animal activist who cut his teeth during the Summer of Love.The NYPD says half the protesters arrested in New York City college protests weren't even students. Democrat mega donors gave professional protesters millions of bucks to train undergrads to conduct urban warfare for Hamas.But Maxine Waters, no relation, says Republicans are the ones plotting violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): We have to be very concerned about a former president of the United States talking about attacking his own country, talking about perhaps a bloodbath.He wants to be a dictator. This is a dangerous human being.I want to know about all of those right wing organizations that he's connected with, who are training up in the hills somewhere and targeting, you know, what communities they're going to attack.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Maxine, no one is training in the hills. They're training in the quad and your donors are funding them. Biden is hard of hearing, but even he can hear "Genocide Joe" chants emanating from campuses as he watched Michigan slip through his fingers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CROWD chanting "Arbor, arbor you can't hide. You are funding genocide.")(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden sees that the war is hurting his re-election, so he is holding up military aid Israel so they don't move into Southern Gaza.I thought delaying aid to an ally to help yourself win an election what's an impeachable offense.Dozens of universities are surrendering to Hamas, caving to protesters' demands. Rutgers is waving the white flag. Evergreen College is divesting from Israel. George Washington University allowing the statue of Washington to be defiled. And now, UCLA has canceled all of their classes.And at Columbia, graduation has been canceled. Parents who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to see their children earn a diploma, not happy.("SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)MICHAEL LONGFELLOW, COMEDIAN: Alphonse, your daughter must feel so supported when she's out there?KENAN THOMPSON, COMEDIAN: What's that now?(LAUGHTER)THOMPSON: When whose daughter is out there?(LAUGHTER)LONGFELLOW: At the protest.THOMPSON: No, no, no, no. Man, you're bugging.Alexis Vanessa Roberts better have her butt in class.(LAUGHTER)THOMPSON: Let me find out if she is in one of them damn tents instead of the dorm room that I paid for.(LAUGHTER)MIKEY DAY, COMEDIAN: Wait. I thought you were in favor of the student protests?THOMPSON: Brother man, I am supportive of your kids protesting.(LAUGHTER)THOMPSON: Not my kids. My kids know better. She ain't talking about no free this, free that because I'll tell you what ain't free -- Columbia.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Columbia senior Katie, who was supposed to walk in graduation. And her dad Jason join me now.Katie, you also weren't able to have graduation in high school because of COVID.KATIE, COLUMBIA STUDENT: No, I wasn't.WATTERS: So this is now the second ceremony that has been canceled. How do you feel?KATIE: It's so disappointing. Honestly, to be honest with you, even weeks ago, when I saw the horrific terrorism unfolding on our campus, I didn't even want to go to my graduation anymore.I worked my entire life to get into Columbia. I got straight As my entire college career. And now I don't even want to walk in my graduation because I know that my administration has proven time and time again, for the last seven months really not only the last three or four weeks that it refuses to protect Jewish students and students who are just regular Americans who just want to go to class.WATTERS: And we know how expensive Columbia is. You must have worked very hard to pay that tuition as a dad, probably one of your proudest moments is seeing your son or daughter walk and receive a diploma.Now you're not going to be able to do that at Columbia, your reaction?JASON, COLUMBIA PARENT: It's heartbreaking. More than just the graduation, you expect to set your child up for life, right? They get into an Ivy League school, you're incredibly proud at that moment. And then you say, oh, they're going to go get a diploma.As my daughter said she has straight As. She just won an award for the best researcher in her department. And now I think, wow, anyone who's going to look at her resume is going to see Columbia University at the top of it.Are they really going to want to delve into whether she was one of the radicalized students who no one will want to hire, and no one will want to let into their graduate school to do the same thing at their school, that's the real fear for me is I've set her up with a degree and paid very handsomely for a degree that will hurt her instead of help her.WATTERS: Yes, sadly, you are going to be discriminated against by prospective employers. Unfair? Fair? It's just so sad. What was it like after October 7th at Columbia for you?KATIE: It's been just horrendous for the last seven months. On October 12th, five days after the massacre of innocent Israeli and American citizens in Israel, hundreds of students on my campus were protesting in support of Hamas before Israel ever engaged in a counteroffensive to defend the country.It was never about Palestinian civilians. It was never about freeing Palestine as they say. They paint their nails for Palestine in the encampment tents. It's about finding some kind of community for people who unfortunately clearly don't have one and spreading terrorism across the country that's purely antisemitic, anti-Israel and anti-American.Every pro-Israeli protest, we have American and Israeli flags and these terrorist supporters rip them from our hands, step on them and set them on fire.WATTERS: When you say they're pro-terrorism, what kind of things did you see and hear from them?KATIE: I've heard them scream. "October 7 is going to happen every day to you, 10,000 times" to my Jewish friends. They've thrown rocks at my friends. They have screamed -- held signs that say "Al-Qasam's next targets" in front of Jews who are singing songs of peace.There was a student who said that "All Zionists deserve to die" and we should all be grateful that he hasn't gone around murdering us yet.This rhetoric shouldn't be allowed anywhere in the country, let alone on a campus that has 5,000 Jewish students.WATTERS: And you saw Hamas flags too?KATIE: Yes, Hamas flags, Hamas symbols, ISIS symbols, Nazi symbols. They are egregiously pro-terror and I'm a big believer, when someone show you who they are, believe them.WATTERS: All right, well, you should be very proud of your daughter, Jason. She's a brilliant woman straight As, won an award. I think no matter what happens with the employment situation, I think she'll do just fine. Congratulations.KATIE: Thank you.JASON: Thank you.WATTERS: Thank you.The Tom Brady roast and what it means for America.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NIKKI GLASER, COMEDIAN: Tom Brady five times Super Bowl MVP, most career wins, most career touchdowns. You have seven rings. Well, eight now the Gisele gave hers back, but --(LAUGHTER)TONY HINCHCLIFFE, COMEDIAN: Tom is afraid of the Giants, which is why Kevin Hart is hosting tonight.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Day 12 of the Trump trial and the prosecution hasn't mentioned what crime Trump committed. The only thing they found him guilty of is free speech.Fox Business correspondent Lydia Hu is in court all day, and she's here.LYDIA HU, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Jesse. That's right.Today, Judge Juan Merchan slapped Donald Trump with his 10th gag order violation. That means it's another $1,000.00 fine for the former president and the judge remarked it seems like these fines are not doing much to deter Trump's public comments that seem to violate the gag order.The judge said this in court today: "The last thing I want to consider is jail. You are a former president and possibly the next president."Now in court, it seemed like Trump sat still, taking in this information from the judge. Meanwhile, Trump's defense attorney, Todd Blanche seemed frustrated. He at one point, Jesse, hung his head in frustration, ran his hands through his hair. Really notable because it's Todd Blanche who usually maintains his composure while he sustains many blows from this judge during the trial.Now we also heard from Jeffrey McConney, a former Trump Organization comptroller. He detailed payments made to Cohen throughout 2017. That's Michael Cohen, Trump's one time fixer and his testimony didn't do much to link Trump to any scheme surrounding Stormy Daniels.In fact, McConney testified that he didn't know exactly what the payments to Michael Cohen were for. He said he rarely spoke directly to Trump and if he did, he would not have discussed payments to Cohen.Then in the afternoon, we heard from Deborah Tarasoff, a financial supervisor. She was a sympathetic witness who also fielded questions about payments to Cohen. Tarasoff said she prepared checks for Trump to sign. Trump meanwhile, maintains all payments made to Cohen were legitimate legal expenses.Now prosecutors say, Jesse, they will need two more weeks to present their case, then what we'll hear from the defense with their case and then closing arguments.Trial resumes tomorrow, and I would love to tell you who the next witness is going to be called by the prosecutors to the stand, but I can't. It is not public information. And in reality, defense attorneys probably only found out only a couple of hours ago who that next witness is going to be because prosecutors are only telling defense attorneys the night before.Jesse, I'll send it back to you.WATTERS: Thank you so much, Lydia.Now let's bring in former federal prosecutor and author of "Woke Warriors."Why Katie, is the prosecution not telling the defense who their witnesses are? They just sandbag them and like let them know the night before. How is that legal?KATIE CHERKASKY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: That's another issue with this case. The defense has not been notified of the next witness. They have to obviously prepare their cross examinations, but Judge Merchan has allowed them to keep this information for some hypothetical thought that they could potentially, I guess intimidate them.WATTERS: So this judge is really, really on the side of the prosecution. And apparently this thing is going to go on for weeks. Trump has complained about it.Today, it looks like he got fined a G for saying that the jury pool in Manhattan is 95 percent Democrat, which is the truth. And then he says you know what? If we have to defend the Constitution, I'll make that sacrifice and go to jail. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I have to watch every word I tell you people. You ask me a question, a simple question I'd like to give it, but I can't talk about it. Because this judge has given me a gag order and said you'll go to jail if you violate it.And frankly, you know what? Our Constitution is much more important than jail, it is not even close. I'll do that sacrifice any day.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: You think he's going to get thrown in the clink?CHERKASKY: Well, I think that the Democrats are in a very tough position now. They're stuck between their dream of finally seeing Trump behind bars and now the nightmare that he is going to become some sort of Civil War rights martyr when he gets put in there. But it's probably the most likely chance that they'll see him behind bars based on the prosecution's presentation so far.So, I don't think Judge Merchan wants to do it because logistically it's a nightmare, but the threats keep building. The order is so vague that it's anyone's guess whether Trump does violate it. That's part of the significant problem here with the constitutionality of the order, is that essentially anything can be interpreted to be a violation of the order.WATTERS: Would Secret Service go to jail with Trump?CHERKASKY: Well, I would hope so. I mean, he was a world leader --WATTERS: Bubba, move over. Move over, the former president has to take a cat nap.CHERKASKY: I think for the sake of our national security, we would want to have protection, somebody that has that many state secrets. I mean, this is a former president we're talking about.The practicality of this is preposterous, but again, Merchan keeps insisting that that's the next step here.WATTERS: All right. He's going to come out with a prison body. That's what happens when you go to prison. You work out. That's all there is to do.Katie, thank you.CHERKASKY: Thanks.WATTERS: Johnny goes to the races.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: We've got a big horse race coming up in November. Trump versus Biden. Who's your money on?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Trump. He likes to do what he likes to do. He likes to rock like how he likes to rock. He's got an attitude problem, and I love it.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Seinfeld was right, political correctness doesn't make for good comedy, but America is ready to laugh again.Non-woke comedian Shane Gillis killed on "SNL" years after they fired him over a joke. Joe Rogan has the number one podcast on Spotify, even Gutfeld succeeding, and in the first quarter of '24 with the highest rated late night show.And this weekend, Netflix dropped two specials that were anything but PC.
