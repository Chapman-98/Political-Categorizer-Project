The case with a crime that Democrats can't even name is now in the hands of 12 men and women from Manhattan, but it didn't come easy.One juror dropped out because she couldn't be impartial. Another juror was forced out for lying, and the DA wants to sanction Trump for publicizing it. We'll get to these new jurors in a second, but their profiles are just as ridiculous as the first batch.No bodega visit today. Instead, after court was adjourned, Trump emerged and urged the judge to crank the thermostat.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I'm sitting here for days now from morning till night in that freezing room, freezing, everybody was freezing in there. And all for this and this is your result. Look at it. Each one have a story, and it is very unfair, very bad thing. A very bad thing.The whole world is watching this hoax. You've got a DA that's out of control. You have a judge that's highly conflicted. The whole thing is a mess and you have the leading candidate and leading Crooked Joe Biden by a lot, he is the one that should be in trial. He is a crook.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The day started off badly for Bragg. Juror number two, the unmarried nurse dropped out because her friends asked her if she was one of the Trump jurors. She said she couldn't take the pressure and couldn't be fair to the former president.Juror number four the Puerto Rican grandfather who found Trump fascinating and mysterious, ended up being a stealth juror. He lied on his jury form about his criminal record. It turns out he was arrested for vandalizing Republican lawn signs. He was working with Democrat Mayor David Dinkins' staff. So the judge booted the undercover grandfather.By the way, all of the information about these jurors comes from reporters in the room. The same things I am reporting so is "The Washington Post," CNN, POLITICO.The media also knows Trump's lawyers have caught prospective jurors being sneaky. Jurors fill out forms that say they're not biased. You know, I've never done this or that. And Trump's team keeps catching them. They've uncovered jurors posting celebrations of Trump losing, videos of Trump that say I'm dumb as eff, posting "lock him up."The media knows this because their own reporters reported it. Even the jurors who told the court they can totally be unbiased, when they're dismissed, run to the media and blast Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Did you say you could be unbiased though?KARA MCGEE, POTENTIAL JUROR: I did.REPORTER: Can we share your opinion or the former president and why you felt that you could be unbiased?MCGEE: I'm not a fan.His handling of COVID-19 was abysmal. I also have -- my sister is also adopted from China -- and the comments he made about China when he was president made her very anxious and therefore made me angry. He had policies he supported on women and reproductive health that I do not agree with.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Another dismiss juror says this jury cannot be impartial.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)YASMIN VOSSOUGHIAN, MSNBC HOST: What happened? Why were you dismissed?KAT, POTENTIAL JUROR: Because I couldn't be impartial.VOSSOUGHIAN: Do you feel like the people that you were speaking with in that jury room that you sat with all day on Tuesday that they can put together a fair and impartial jury because of that sense of duty? Do you think that's possible?KAT: I'm not sure about that.VOSSOUGHIAN: Really? Why?KAT: You know, everybody has biases and you know -- you know, stereotypes in their mind, so you have to be really deep and you know, fair person, which is very hard to do, right, in order to serve as a juror.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Self-proclaimed unbiased jurors are blasting Trump and saying there is no way that jurors they've been talking to can be fair, and others are getting caught lying to get on the jury, and getting caught posting on Facebook "lock him up."The most famous man in the world, whose personal life was in the tabloids for decades, and who was already president and who has had hundreds of millions of dollars in negative attack ads thrown at him. The most investigated politician in American history, and the most lied about politician is not going to get a fair trial and his opponent's most partisan city.The prosecutor is a Biden Democrat, the judge is a Biden donor, the Biden campaign paid the judge's family and people arrested for tearing down Republican lawn signs are lying to the court to get on the jury?Donald Trump, if he is re-elected, his policies are going to directly change the lives of these jurors from taxes to health care to foreign policy, but, you know, honestly, he's mostly going to affect their mental health.How could they ever put any of this aside? That's why we don't have political trials in this country. These 12 Jurors know more about Donald Trump than any juror has ever known about any defendant ever.Johnny hit the streets to see if we could find a New Yorker who would give Trump a fair shake.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Do you recognize this man?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Brings a smile to my face every time.

You're doing great so far.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Today's jury selection was just as bad as Tuesday. One prospective juror said she wouldn't believe Trump even if his tongue were notarized. She also called him racist and sexist on social media.Another one said her son worked in DC and when asked for who, she said Hakeem Jeffries, the top House Democrat. One woman said she marched at the Woman's March is a CNN viewer and used to work for the US Attorney's Office, and all three of these people told the court they'd be unbiased. That's some jury pool.Now let's round out the rest.In the seat of juror number two, an investment banker from New York. Oh, and also he happens to follow Michael Cohen on Twitter, the prosecution's star witness and also gets his news from "The New York Times."Another juror, a security engineer born in California without a college degree. He is married with three kids and likes to work with his hands, woodworking metalworking. Not bad.Jury number eight, a retired wealth manager with two kids says he knows about Trump and he's more interested in fly fishing and yoga. Could be good.Juror number nine, a single woman no kids, who gets her news from CNN and "The New York Times." Says she has opinions about Trump, but can put them aside. I think you know what that means.Juror number 10, a guy from Ohio. He works at a big company college educated, not married, no kids but lives with another adult who's an accountant. Not that there's anything wrong with that. He also loves animals. Does he love caged animals? We'll find out.Juror number 11, a woman without a husband and kids who doesn't like Trump's persona, says Trump is very selfish and self-serving. And he's "not my cup of tea." Flat out says she doesn't like him, but claims she'll be fair. They probably ran out of strikes.Final juror, a female physical therapist with a doctorate who reads "The New York Times," "USA Today" and you guessed it, CNN. The alternate is definitely a problem for Trump, but we're not even going to get into her.That's your jury, ladies and gentlemen: Seven men, five women. Some teachers, lawyers, therapists, a lot of single women, mostly CNN viewers, and who can forget the young lady who gets her news from TikTok and loves to dance.Let's bring in former federal prosecutor Katie Cherkasky.All right, Katie, this juror number two follows Michael Cohen on Twitter. Is that going to be a problem for the defense?KATIE CHERKASKY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I guess it depends why he is following him. Maybe it's just for entertainment purposes. But I mean, they only need one juror, but I think you said it in your opening, Trump fundamentally can't have an impartial jury here because all of these people have a stake in the outcome of this case.If we're to believe the polling, then this case will impact the election and everybody that lives in this country is going to be impacted by who is the next president, so the bottom line --WATTERS: That is such a great point that I haven't heard made yet is this isn't your typical criminal trial where someone gets locked up, okay, you'll probably still be safe. Or if someone's acquitted, you'll be safe.This impacts everyone's life, not just theirs, but the entire country's life. How can you put that aside?CHERKASKY: Well, you can't put that aside, and even just from a fundamental legal perspective, the definition of impartiality is that you do not have a stake in the outcome of the case. Every single person here whether they can say it or not, has a stake because their lives will be impacted. It's just the inherent issue with this case proceeding at this point.WATTERS: Yes.CHERKASKY: So all of this is really problematic. But that being said, I think Trump has a chance.WATTERS: Why do you think he has a chance? Is it the guy who likes woodworking and metalworking? Because that's the kind of guy I think you want on the jury. Someone is creative, maybe humble, works with his hands.CHERKASKY: That sounds like a good profile, but from a trial lawyer perspective, you can't really go in thinking who is for you and against you. You have to ingratiate all of them to you. You have to pull them along, find what's going to motivate them. And some of these people maybe will never ever do that in their life. But you never know. So you can't just --WATTERS: So you're saying the woman that flat out hates him says she's not his cup of tea, hates his persona Trump can actually win her over?CHERKASKY: It might be possible that there's things about this case that she doesn't know from the coverage she is following that will change her mind. You know, these people were questioned by the defense, they weren't struck for cause because even though there's only certain number of peremptory challenges, and again, Judge Merchan is not very generous with the courthouse challenges, but if somebody is even implicitly bias, they would be excused. So there's something about them that perhaps is salvageable.WATTERS: Okay. If someone is a retired wealth manager, with children, who is really into fly fishing and yoga. Tell me about that profile. I see that as a potential defense juror.CHERKASKY: Yes, it could be good especially here, we have a situation with finances. We have a business decision potentially to pay this hush money, something that he may be able to appreciate.WATTERS: Does the speech therapist scare you? Does the does the teacher scare? Do the two corporate litigators scare you?CHERKASKY: I will -- I'll split those up. I think that some people are classic profiles of Trump haters. They've been spending years of their lives literally obsessing over how much they hate Trump and I don't think that they're going to come back around.The lawyers though I'm not too worried about because in this case, I actually think the law and the facts are very strong for Trump. And so if you have lawyers who are you know, actually reviewing the case and analyzing it from a critical perspective? They may actually favor him.WATTERS: And the foreman, born in Ireland, Katie you never know with the Irish.CHERKASKY: I think that's a good thing.WATTERS: We never know how it's going to shake out. That's why it's just so crazy. Thank you so much, Katie.CHERKASKY: Thank you.MACDONALD: Biden says cannibals ate his uncle. Right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: While Trump is stuck in New York, Biden is campaigning in Pennsylvania, where he won by two points last time. Polls tell a different story this time. More on that in a second.Biden held a rally at a gym in Philly and couldn't fill it. That's half a gym. And half of those people are reporters. There's a million people in Philly, COVID is over. There's no excuses.Biden was there with RFK, Jr.'s family trying to neutralize the third party threat, but before he got on stage they had to call security.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did I do to you? What did I do to you?I did nothing. This is a free country.This is a free country. I have rights.I have rights. I have rights. I have rights. I have the right to be here.I was invited. This is my right to be here. I have the right. My rights are violated.He is not our president.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The guy wouldn't stop shrieking over RFK, Jr.'s sister.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KERRY KENNEDY, RFK, JR.'S SISTER: So we need everybody to come and vote.(UNIDENTIFIED MALE screaming.)KENNEDY: Vote for President Biden. If we vote for somebody else, that's a vote for Trump. Don't do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Small crowds, hecklers, hoaxes, that's the Biden campaign. Joe is trying to handle retail politics deal, went to a Wawa, wouldn't let anybody else in. The whole thing was choreographed. Our cameras caught the Wawa workers coordinating how the order was going to play out before Biden waltz in. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're going to do the handoff. David, he's going to give you a tip so just take it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Right on cue, Biden shuffled in with a tip in his hand.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Hey.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello sir, how are you doing today?BIDEN: Good. How are you doing man?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Great. How are you doing today?BIDEN: My pleasure.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's my pleasure to meet both of you.BIDEN: You got my stuffUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh yogurt, yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And this is for you, sir.BIDEN: All right, and this is a tip for you. I know it's all been paid.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But then Biden went off script.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I've got to check out one thing here, what kind of drinks do you have?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So whatever you like, sir. We can customize it to your specifications. So we have smoothies, we have milk shakes, we have refreshers. We also have --BIDEN: How about a -- how about a milkshake. Black and white.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can take that one.BIDEN: You take that box. I am going to go order a milkshake.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: There's no love. No small talk. A scripted sale in an empty room. No fanfare, no fun. The entire Pennsylvania swing has been a disaster. Little boys are flipping them the bird.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I never thought I'd see a sign when I'm going through a neighborhood or a rural town in the West just to see a big sign that have a Trump sign in the middle that says, "Eff Biden." And having little kids standing with his middle finger, seven years old, eight years old.Well, I promise it happens all the time.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And he's telling everybody his uncle was eaten by cannibals.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: He flew single-engine planes, as reconnaissance over war zones. He got shot down in New Guinea and they never found the body because it used to be, there are a lot of cannibals for real in that part of New Guinea.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The Associated Press says Biden's off on details about his uncle getting eaten by cannibals. But how do we know the guy didn't swim ashore, get captured, and then cooked by the cannibals? We don't.So we have to trust but verify. So we reached out to the New Guinea Cannibal Association and they tell us they did indeed eat Biden's uncle, and he tasted delicious. And then added, where's Hunter?Now if Trump said his family was eaten by cannibals, they'd call him a racist liar and fly Jim Acosta to New Guinea who definitely doesn't taste as good, but Biden's campaign says he is totally sharp. They put out a new ad on it today. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love to tell the story about meeting President Biden because when you meet him, this guy is as sharp as a knife.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: If you have to tell people you're sharp, you're not. Instead of spending millions on an ad saying you're sharp, just be sharp for free. Voters agree. Trump is up in Georgia, Michigan, and tied in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all states Biden won in 2020.Dennis Kucinich, the former presidential candidate.Dennis, before we get to the politics. If Joe Biden is saying cannibals ate his uncle. Do you think he should have his head checked?DENNIS KUCINICH, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am going to say this, Jesse.WATTERS: Yes.KUCINICH: As a vegan, I find this discussion -- I find this discussion distasteful.WATTERS: Okay. It's alright.When you see Joe Biden wander into Wawa and a scripted exchange of milkshakes, and then getting lost. And then you compare that to Trump going to Chick-Fil-A and getting mobbed by young Black women who scream "I'm going to tell my mom, I'm famous." What does that tell you about the state of the race?KUCINICH: Well, let me just say that President Biden has to be out there campaigning, I think it's a good thing for the president to go out and meet people. I think the presidential race is going to be very close.But the issue, everyone is -- when everything is sorted out, it's going to end up being about the economy. You've got a situation where for millions of Americans, their expenses are outstripping the money that they have to go into debt. Moody's, by the way, said -- I think it said families are spending $784.00 each month more for goods and services than they did two years ago. Inflation is up about 19 percent over three years.Joe's numbers are translating --WATTERS: Sure, Dennis, that milkshakes that Joe Biden just bought was $10,000.00. That's probably why he didn't know what to do.KUCINICH: People are hurting, Jesse and they get upset with government, right or wrong, they'll blame the president. You know, in Pennsylvania, which President Biden has been. Pennsylvania has had a long-term financial problem because of the United States trade laws. It's one of the reasons why the steel industry was so badly degraded in the United States, and it hit Pennsylvania, as hard as it in any place.Fortunately, US Steel is still hanging in there. But you know, there's a lot of discontent out there. And its essence is economic, but it's also fueled by the border and by billions of dollars that are being spent for foreign wars.There is discontent that's being stirred up, but bottom line, people are worried about prices and they are told by the government the GDP is going up, but for whom?WATTERS: Of course they are. And Joe Biden is letting the Japanese buy US steel or buy American steel companies. It's absolutely insane. Do you believe that people as young as seven or flipping Joe Biden the bird?KUCINICH: Well, you know, I think we have to respect the president and the presidency and it is really important, and we ought to reestablish that if it doesn't exist now. And children in particular should be taught respect for the president and the presidency.I think we really have to start taking a different direction in our politics, they're too they're too personal, they're too destructive, and they ultimately undermine who we are as Americans. So --WATTERS: I agree.KUCINICH: I'm not particularly happy hearing about kids giving.WATTERS: Me neither.KUCINICH: . the president --WATTERS: Me neither. We have to get it together, Dennis. If we could just get it together, everything would be just a-okay.Enjoy your vegan burger. I hope it's delicious.Peace.Fox News Alert: A Haitian illegal alien has just been arrested for double homicide here in New York.The illegal broke into the country using Joe Biden's border app this summer.

Now.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Anti-war protests are fine. I mean, this is America. You can do that. But you can't swear allegiance to terrorists. You can't say I'm with ISIS and not expect a knock on your door. We were told that MAGA were terrorists. Hillary said we need reprogramming.But I never saw a MAGA pledge support for terrorists. And now that these trust fund terrorists had been arrested, they're begging for help on social media. "Bring me cigarettes and water."Former presidential candidate in Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard joins me now.So you understand. I mean, you can go out and you can protest Israel all you want. You can protest the war. You can say I'm anti-Israel even. You cannot say I'm pro-Hamas. They're a terrorist organization. What do you think the repercussions should be, Tulsi?TULSI GABBARD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, let's first look, Jessie at how we got here. You're exactly right. They have gone beyond saying we are pro-Hamas. They are saying we are Hamas, which is a terrorist, Islamist terrorist organization, no different from al Qaeda and ISIS. And so you look at these young students.They're at Columbia University, at many other schools and cities across the country. These are especially young Americans who don't have a strong ideology of their own. They hardly know what is enshrined in the Constitution or what is in the Bill of Rights.And so they're very susceptible to this ideological warfare that Islamist terrorist groups like Hamas are waging, and are therefore easily converted and buying into that ideology.You go back to after the 9/11 terrorist attack that we experienced. You had President Bush and others who came after him who declared that they would wage both kinetic and ideological war on radical Islam. The problem is that the ideological war never really took place and it is either because they were intellectually incapable of waging that war, or they were just afraid because as you know very well, Jesse, as soon as you speak out, or anyone speaks out against radical Islam, you're immediately tagged with the label of well, you're just an Islamophobe.So what we're seeing here with these young people, what we're seeing here in America and around the world is the near and long term threat of radical Islam and how their ideology is very quickly spreading, putting under threat all who are peace-loving, freedom-loving people, putting under threat our civilization.WATTERS: Sure. You know, I can understand why, you know, Biden says, my uncle was eaten by cannibals. He hasn't been asked a follow up, okay. But you now have almost a hundred people identifying as terrorists, lighting fires and getting arrested in New York City at an Ivy League school. And the president of the United States hasn't said anything, hasn't been asked about it, hasn't said anything.Is there a reason? Does it have to do with Michigan that he's not saying anything?GABBARD: It is. He is -- President Biden is terrified like so many Democrat elite that we see in Washington of being attacked by the squad or others who are either pro-Hamas, Hamas apologists who are also scared themselves of being targeted by these activists.Once again, it just points to, if they are so afraid of the "political consequences" of doing the right thing, of acting in the best interest of our security, acting in the best interest of a peace and freedom loving society, it just shows how they are only interested in serving their own selfish interests and they don't really care for our country, our Constitution, or freedom because that's what's at stake here.WATTERS: No one cares like you do, Tulsi and I'll see you soon.GABBARD: See you soon.WATTERS: Now if you're a politician, the global warming mob is going to pay you a visit, but we never seen anybody get tackled before, which is what happened to the Lisa Murkowski event in DC.

DEI is something we must have.WATTERS: At DEI Thursday, PRIMETIME's favorite day of the week.In honor of Reverend Al Sharpton, we're bringing you the best stories about diversity, equity, and inclusion.For Jackie Robinson Day, Joy Reid's program says Major League Baseball isn't Black enough.The number of Black American players in Major League Baseball has plummeted to just six percent, offering a warning about what can happen when institutions de-emphasize diversity.Are they saying baseball needs more DEI? Because 30 percent of the players are Latino and there's more Asians in baseball than in any other American sport.The league's biggest stars Japanese. Major League Baseball is the biggest professional sport melting pot we have.What about the NBA and NFL? The vast majority of their players are Black, 70 percent around. MSNBC is not complaining. They equate diversity with Blackness and Blackness alone. They are saying Latinos and Asians aren't diverse.Dan Dakich is the host of "Don't At Me" on outkick.com.Dan, you know more about baseball demographics than I do. Is she right? Only six percent?DAN DAKICH, HOST, "DON'T AT ME" ON OUTKICK.COM: Yes, that's probably true. But you know, who cares? Jesse, sports is the ultimate meritocracy. I mean, seriously, it is. What are you going to do? Go out and draft players? Pass on a really good player because he's not diverse enough? No.Sports has always been the ultimate meritocracy, whether it's six percent or 26 percent. You were talking earlier, the NBA, 16.8 percent of the NBA is White as opposed to 75.5 percent of the country is White, 19 percent Latinos in the NBA, excuse me, Latinos in this country, three percent are in the NBA, 73 percent of the players in the NBA are Black, only 13 percent of the population.It's stupid. This argument is made by a dumb person who does not know what they're talking about who is trying to drive race in an area where, Jesse, everybody will tell you the most diverse thing, the most open thing in our country is a locker room.A professional team, they don't care. Look, there are teams that have started guys that have been up for murder. If they're good enough. They don't care, Jesse. It's the dumbest argument ever, Jesse. It is so stupid.WATTERS: I know. And most of the White NBA players are European. So you know, go figure there.DAKICH: Well, that appears to be diverse. I mean, as you said earlier, is it only Black, you know, when you're involved with a team, and you're putting together a team, what you're trying to do is one thing and that's win.And I swear to God, as a head coach or an assistant coach, whatever I was for 20 some years, you don't care about any of it. You don't. You just want players that fit you and if they're Black, great, if they're White, great.And I know guys across the board, Black college coaches, White college coaches football, basketball. Nobody cares. The only people that care are race baiters that have nothing else to talk about that see a number, equate it to another number, and next thing you know, it's a story and two very intelligent man, you and I, have to talk about it because it's so stupid. That's what we have to do.WATTERS: Well, speak for yourself. I wouldn't call myself intelligent, I have great instincts. How about that?DAKICH: There you go.WATTERS: Dan, thank you so much. I think you summed it up perfectly when you said who cares?Volcanoes are next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Absolutely wild video capturing the Northern Lights shining over an erupting volcano in Iceland. This volcano has been active for a month, the second longest continuous eruption in the past three years and has exploded at least four times. Just unbelievable. We'll keep you updated with the latest in Volcano News.There's no better tournament and golf than the Masters, the traditions, pimento cheese sandwiches, the azaleas, visiting Augusta is like going to the Vatican, but greener.Every year for four days in April, it is a place where golf fans and let's be honest, wealthy insiders go to see and be seen. So what was the mayor of DC doing there?Mayor Muriel Bowser flew down to Augusta on the taxpayers' dime to catch the third round on Saturday. A thousand miles round trip, taxpayers paid for it. Her office says she wrote it off as a "sports and economic development trip" and that she was invited by the city task force to revitalize the Gallery Place and Chinatown neighborhood.Interesting. How does going to the Masters to eat peach ice cream developed the city's economy? I don't know. But they're saying the purpose of the trip was to explore bringing more golf opportunities to DC.Well, DC has just three golf courses. They're public. And as far as we can tell, they've never hosted a single professional tournament. Now, we're not here to course shame, but you know, I don't think these places are ready for a PGA event, let alone a major. An amateur event or any high school outing.One course is in such bad shape it needs a multiyear renovation. Man, if she does get a PGA tournament maybe I'll be there. Johnny will be my caddy.Gigi walked. We have video of it. She took four steps. This time it's official. When a little child that age takes one step and falls, can't count it. You need consistent back-to-back strides and she's accomplished that and if you want to see the video, we can bring it to you tomorrow.Let's do some texts.Susan from Charleston, South Carolina: If some jurors can identify as impartial I can identify as a giraffe.Rick from Marion, Iowa: The CNN viewership will hit rock bottom while those jurors are in trial.Ed from Fremont, Nebraska: Undercover grandfather sounds like a great new reality show.In fact, we should add undercover grandfather to the nickname bracket, slide it in. Midseat.Eamon from Hope Sound, Florida: I wonder if the judge has a space heater under the bench?Seriously? I mean, why is he keeping it so cold? I think he's onto something.Del from Texas: They should select jurors who watch National Geographic Channel, not CNN.The only person who watches Fox is the foreman from Ireland. The rest CNN, MSNBC, and NPR. How could you forget.Mark from New York: They couldn't let someone in the jury pool who gets their news from Gutfeld.Strike.Lesley from California: It used to be the dog ate my homework and now it's the cannibals ate my uncle.Delicious.Mike from Columbia, South Carolina: Two cannibals are eating a clown. One cannibal turns to the other and asks, does this taste funny to you?Patty from Pittsburgh: Wonder if Wawa charged Joe 30 cents for the bags.Now for people that don't understand what Wawa is, this is kind of like a tristate area, 7-Eleven, Quickie Mart deal, but it's not just that, it's got hoagies/ You get sandwiches, cigarettes. You get beer. It's fantastic. Wawa. It might be Native American. Wawa? I don't know.That's what Wawa is.Rick from Folsom, California: Did Joe use a straw with that shake?We have been having producers comb over video to see if he's eating from the straw. Hopefully, he seems like a straw guy. We've seen it before.Harold from Illinois: The NHL needs diversity, 62 percent are Canadians.Tom from Virginia: You need to watch out for your Johnny. That young lady was hitting on him.Seriously.She was making love to him with her eyes. Disgusting. Should have had a viewer warning.I'm Watters and this is my world.
