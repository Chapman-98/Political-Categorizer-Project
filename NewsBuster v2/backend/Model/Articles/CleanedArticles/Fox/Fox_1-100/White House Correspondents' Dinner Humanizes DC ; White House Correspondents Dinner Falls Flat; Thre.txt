All right, that's it for us tonight.Follow me on social -- special -- I can't even speak you're talking in my ear.All right, MacCallum next and Jesse.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --COLIN JOST, COMEDIAN: The economy, the vibes are bad, but the numbers say it's strong. The economy is kind of like you on the steps of Air Force One.WATTERS: Biden and the Correspondents' Dinner: What the real message was?JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What in the hell is going on?PROTESTER: You don't deserve to (bleep) live. This is our land.WATTERS: The Arab Spring Break gives Columbia the finger.(PERSON screaming "Help.")JERRY SEINFELD, COMEDIAN: There will be some funny stuff we can watch on TV tonight. Well, guess what? Where is it? This is the result of the extreme left and PC crap.WATTERS: Seinfeld says the left killed comedy.John O'Hurley is here.("SEINFELD" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)J. PETERMAN, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight.WATTERS: Plus --JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Tell me about the Bill of Rights.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh my God. Cut the cameras.WATTERS: Once a year, politicians, journalists and celebrities get dressed up for the White House Correspondents' Dinner, a tradition that goes back over a century to Warren Harding.When the president and the press who theoretically have an adversarial relationship, lay down their weapons and pick up their silverware and give each other a good old ribbing over cocktails and fillet. It's designed to demonstrate the humanity of Washington, which is why it only happens once a year.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RONALD REAGAN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's not often that we have so many people who've written about us and broadcast about us, all together in one room like this, and I thought you might like to say a few nice words, too.How about just a word or two something friendly, even one kind word?NANCY REAGAN, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm thinking. I'm thinking.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The presidents flex they're funny bones. They bring props, even impersonators.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. Here I am.As you know, I always look forward to these dinners.STEVE BRIDGES, GEORGE W. BUSH IMPERSONATOR: It`s just a bunch of media types, Hollywood liberals, Democrats like Joe Biden. How come I can`t have dinner with the 36 percent of the people who like me?(LAUGHTER)BUSH: You know, it`s good to see so many influential guests here tonight: Justice Scalia, Justice Alito...BRIDGES: Yes, all the usual suspects. Speaking of suspects, where`s the Great White Hunter?BUSH: I`m sorry Vice President Cheney couldn`t be here tonight.(LAUGHTER)The only thing missing is Hillary Clinton sitting on the front row rolling her eyes.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Barack Obama brought out his anger translator.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We won't always see eye to eye.KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY, COMEDIAN: Oh, and CNN, thank you so much for the wall- to-wall Ebola coverage, for two whole weeks, we were one step away from "The Walking Dead."(LAUGHTER)KEY: And then you all got up and you've moved on to the next day. That was awesome. Oh, and by the way, just if you haven't noticed, you don't have Ebola.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And in order, even the score the press books a comedian to roast them all.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOEL MCHALE, COMEDIAN: The Vice President isn't here tonight not for security reasons. He just thought this event was being held at the Dulles Airport Applebee's.(LAUGHTER)MCHALE: Yes, right now, Joe was elbow deep in jalapeno poppers and talking to a construction cone he thinks is John Boehner.(LAUGHTER)MCHALE: Also true.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But the relationship between the press and then President Trump was so acrimonious, you know with them calling him a racist Russian traitor from day one, that he no-showed the dinner for his entire term.Biden brought the party back Saturday night, but had a hard time breaking bread, literally breaking that piece of bread looked challenging.Now, we didn't slow the tape down at all, this is at regular speed. You'd think having dinner with a thousand of your closest friends, an entire industry keeping you in office can be in a better mood, but Biden just looked mad that he had to eat salad.Colin Jost who is married to Scarlett Johansson and who does "Weekend Update" on "Saturday Night Live," he was the emcee.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOST: The last time I was in DC I left my cocaine at the White House.(LAUGHTER)JOST: Luckily, the president was able to put it to good use for his State of the Union.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Colin had another good line.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOST: Like many of you here tonight, I pretend to do news on TV.(LAUGHTER)JOST: My "Weekend Update" co-anchor, Michael Che was going to join me here tonight, but in solidarity with President Biden, I decided to lose all my Black support.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Besides that, Colin's jokes didn't have any bite. The president still being protected even at a roast.Finally, Joe got on stage and had one good joke.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: It's been a year since I've delivered this speech and my wife Jill is with me tonight and was worried how I'd do. I told her, don't worry, it's just like riding a bike. She said, "That' what I'm worried about."(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now, the rest of the evening was lame and tame. The president's jokes didn't land and most of his material wasn't even aimed at the press. Trump was the punch line.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: The 2024 election is in full swing, and yes, age is an issue. I'm a grown man running against a six-year-old.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden and the press are supposed to get up there and roast each other, and neither of them did. The president and the press are now a protected class. The media is a joke and Biden can't take one.'Barack Obama did 20 minutes on stage. Biden only spoke for six. He didn't bash the media, he actually begged the media to bury Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I'd ask you to rise up to the seriousness of the moment, move past the horse race numbers, and the gotcha moments and the distractions, the sideshows that have come to dominate and sensationalize our politics and focus on what's actually at stake.I think in your hearts, you know what's at stake. The stakes couldn't be higher. Every single one of us has a role to play, a serious role to play, making sure democracy endures -- American democracy.I have my role, but with all due respect, so do you.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: What kind of democracy does America have if the president conspires with the press to put the other politician in prison? Biden is ordering reporters, don't cover my bad polls, my gaffes, or the Arab Spring Break. Don't cover this election. Your role is to destroy my rival.How much more help can the media give Joe? And how is the media getting bossed around by a guy who doesn't even talk to them?He is barking orders to "The New York Times" who he has never sat down with after he just sat down with Howard Stern for an hour.Biden ducked Super bowl interviews with CBS so he can play patty cake with Al Roker. And now he is ordering reporters to cover the bloodbath hoax, not the horse race? It's because Biden is losing the horse race and wants to keep it hidden from the country.A new CNN poll has Biden losing to Trump by six points. These are landslide numbers. When you factor in RFK, Jr. Trump is almost beating Biden by double digits, and this is a CNN poll.The Bloomberg poll had Trump beating Biden in six out of the seven battlegrounds -- look at that. And Trump has been in court for the last two weeks while Biden has been campaigning."The New York Times" calls it a blueprint for a Trump Electoral College victory and a gift from the political gods: "The Manhattan courtroom will be the setting for Mr. Trump to play the role of the familiar American archetype. The wronged man seeking justice from corrupt powerful forces. The former president is good in this role, and that's no small thing."Maybe the gag orders and corrupt court calendar will win Trump the White House just like Biden's basement campaign did. It keeps the former president disciplined, structured, and away from his tongue wagging, freewheeling rallies and forces Biden to actually campaign.It gives the media less of an opportunity to whisk Trump's words and more of an opportunity for Biden to get tongue twisted, or tell us cannibals ate his uncle, and it puts Biden in a harsh spotlight and puts Trump on an interesting stage that voters have never seen before -- an intriguing courtroom drama.Remember Trump beat Hillary by running against a rigged system? And what better scene could a director set for Trump than in a courtroom? Unfairly prosecuted by savage Democrats rigging the election with trials because they know the sitting president can barely stand.Even though Biden told Howard Stern he'd debate Trump, Democrats don't want him to.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JONATHAN MARTIN, POLITICO POLITICS BUREAU CHIEF AND SENIOR POLITICAL COLUMNIST: Biden, folks don't want him to debate. They don't want to give Trump that platform and risk exposing Biden like that on national TV.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Ducking a presidential debate while you put your opponent on trial is exactly why Biden spent Saturday night not poking fun at the press, but begging them to save democracy, when he really means, save his presidency.Former one White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany joins me now.Kayleigh, did you go to the dinner?KAYLEIGH MCENANY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CO-HOST "OUTNUMBERED": No, Jesse, I stay far away from the hyenas. I spent enough time with them in the briefing room.WATTERS: Good. You were probably watching JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME on DVR, like all of us do on Saturday night.MCENANY: Of course. Yes.WATTERS: What was this like for you? I know you experienced this, you know, sitting there and then watching it from TV. This one seemed different to me.MCENANY: Yes, it is really odd to watch Joe Biden sit there and complain that this room full of people are insufficiently sycophantic to him.I mean, these are people that drool over him. When I look at some of these polls, and I see, oh, there are two percent who think the economy is excellent. They're the people in that room. They were less than thrilled. And there you have Biden sitting there, begging them, essentially to cover for him.And it's just interesting to watch, because, you know, I go back to my briefings and how hostile the press is, and Karine Jean-Pierre's briefing, it is really just a conversation among friends.And you look at what happened Saturday night, it's just another conversation among friends, add in some wine, add in some dinner and put it on a Saturday night.This is the group that America is up against. The press is covering for him, but I don't think it makes him cross the finish line.WATTERS: Yes, probably adding some gummies too. When you know somebody who you don't like Kayleigh and that person who you don't like, likes something and then you think, wait a second, if that person likes something, I can't like that. That must be bad.It's kind of like when Gutfeld likes a song, I'm like, oh, my God, this song must be terrible. Do you think the American voters see the media love and protect Joe Biden so pathetically, they're like, wait a second, this is gross. If someone likes Joe Biden that much, and carries that much water for him, something must be wrong.MCENANY: Yes, yes. And I totally resonate with the Gutfeld song, so I'm with you on that.WATTERS: Yes, it could be worse. Right.MCENANY: They are the worst and yours are pretty good there on "The Five."WATTERS: Thank you.MCENANY: But look, I think that -- you know, they see the economy is terrible. They can't afford food. I mean, this is widespread, young people can't afford mortgages, can't afford a home, can't afford rent, and then you flip it over to "The New York Times" and there is this one article, I just can't get out of my head from a few months backwards. "Aviator Joe, Dark Brandon."And that time when that meme came up, they just all glommed onto it, and all of these major news outlets were almost celebratory, like this guy is finally cool. He finally has one iota of the swagger that Barack Obama had, and they tried to make it work.And people just looked at that, they rolled their eyes, and they see this presidency for the failure of what it is and they think back to three years ago, and they remember the good days of President Trump and that is why you see the polls soaring the way they are for the former president.WATTERS: Yes, Dark Brandon had trouble ripping that dinner roll in half, probably needed his aviators for that little oomph.Kayleigh, thank you so much. Good to see you.MCENANY: Little butter knife.WATTERS: Little butter knife. Use the knife.MCENANY: Thank you.WATTERS: Johnny goes to Palm Beach.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Name a state that borders Florida.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: South Carolina.BELISARIO: Sweet Home --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Alabama.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Fox News Alert: A shootout in Charlotte, North Carolina leaving at least three law enforcement officers dead. National correspondent Bill Melugin has more -- Bill.BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Jesse, unfortunately the reports coming out of Charlotte tonight are pretty horrible so far. Three US Marshals are dead and several local cops are hurt as a result of a shootout with multiple armed suspects and take a listen to this video as neighbors could hear the gunshots.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)MELUGIN: Now local residents report they could hear active gunfire for hours as US Marshals in the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department were trying to serve a fugitive warrant on somebody for possession of a firearm by a felon.Now, police say as they approached the home to serve that warrant, they were shot at from somebody inside the house. Officers shot back and ended up killing the shooter on the front lawn, but as they approached the house for a second time afterwards, those officers were met with more gunfire from inside the house.Ultimately, two people inside the home were detained. Tragically, three US Marshals were killed and four Charlotte police officers were injured, one critically.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We believe there are two shooters involved. Again, we have two people of interest at the police station that are being questioned right now and we have confirmed that the individual that was set up that we were serving the warrant on was the individual who fired the initial shots and was deceased in the front yard at the end of all of this.(END VIDEO CLIP)MELUGIN: And Jesse, the Fraternal Order of Police says at least 11 police officers all across the country have been shot in the last three days alone.Now, in reaction to this shooting, they posted on X that there is a war on going on cops in America, and they say that is "a stain on society."We'll send it back to you.WATTERS: Bill thank you.MELUGIN: Yep.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: Campus crackdowns in schools across the country this weekend in Texas, Arizona, and Georgia where cops hauled students away like spoiled kids.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're hurting me. You're hurting me. (Screaming) Help. Help.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But there are still major pockets of resistance. Cambridge and Harvard students tore down the American flag and raised the Palestinian one. Just another reason why Jesse, Jr. is going to Princeton.At UCLA, it looked like the Gaza Strip with Israeli and Hamas defenders duking it out in hand-to-hand combat in a mosh pit.Arab Spring Breakers even had the nerve to disrupt the nerd prom. Yep, demented adult staged mock executions of Israeli soldiers committing war crimes right outside the White House Correspondents' Dinner, which itself is a crime against comedy.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: Today, we saw how two different parts of the country handle crime. Texas enforces the law. State Troopers broke up a massive illegal student protest forming at UT-Austin, 50 people arrested. But at Columbia where a caliphate has been set up on the quad, this part of the country decided not to enforce the law.The university set a deadline for 2:00 PM today, pack up the terrorist tent city or face the consequences, and guess what happened? The clock struck two and nothing.Rules don't exist if you don't enforce them. Ask any parent what happens when you negotiate bedtime. Then ask what happens when there is no bedtime?Do you want to live in a house where children don't follow the rules because they aren't enforced? Well, we're living in a country where adults don't follow the rules, because they're not enforced.Do you like living in a country like that? I don't. "The View" thinks we're being too hard on little Johnny Jihad.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": It has never been in my life and my career that criticizing policies of government is equated with antisemitism, and that I think is a far right -- it comes from far right. It comes from the authoritarian leanings where they don't want students on these campuses to voice their opinions because they want to change the narrative going forward.I think we have to be very, very clear on that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: No one supports free speech on campus more than conservatives. We should be able to protest war, chant slogans, and speak your mind without anybody censoring or arresting you.But this isn't about free speech. This is about physically intimidating and harassing a religious minority on campus with violent and antisemitic threats and preventing them from going to class, forcing remote learning, and blockading the site where graduation is supposed to happen.Conservatives said the wrong pronouns and they were chased off campus by throngs of purple-haired Women Studies majors. But liberals can yell "Kill Jews" from a Hamas campsite and members of Congress come visit and then order them pizza?You know, it's gotten bad when the media says Republicans are pouncing.The Bezos "Washington Post" saying Trump GOP seize on campus protests to depict chaos under Biden. Well, I am not sure we are depicting chaos. I think this is chaos.They lathered up these schools with DEI, CRT, and scrapped the SATs and then had tenured faculty tell them they'd get extra credit for activism. They can chant hate speech, and there's no consequences, classes are canceled and Biden is hiding under his desk.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We continue to believe and I've said this multiple times already, today, is that peaceful -- peacefully protest, American should have the right to do so, to peacefully protest, whether it's at a commencement or at their school or anywhere in this country.It has to be done where we do not have hateful rhetoric, violent rhetoric. We cannot -- we not -- we've got to condemn those. That it should not be allowed.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Founder of Lest People Forget, Elizabeth Pipko joins me now.Elizabeth, so you heard Sunny on "The View" say this is just about free speech, and they should be able to protest on campus and it is not anti- American to protest war. What do you say?ELIZABETH PIPKO, FOUNDER, LEST WE FORGET PROJECT: Well, first of all, it is incredibly anti-American to tear down American flags during your protest while you raise up flags of other nations. That's number one.Number two, I'd like to point out all of the incidents we have seen, the horrific incidents. I'm talking about the violence, the threats, the hate speech on these campuses. These are the faults solely of the universities, not the student protesters. And again, we're not talking here about the right to peacefully protest. Like you said, we all support the right to peacefully protest.We're talking about the university's own rules, standards and policies which are being broken every single day and anytime one of these schools puts out any kind of potential threat to enforce their own policies, we know those threats are empty, not just me and you, Jesse. When I say we, I mean the students at these schools know that the threats are empty.By the way, the ones who break the rules, but also the ones who are at home terrified right now because they've been threatened on their own campuses for either being pro-Israel or Jewish themselves.WATTERS: So what happens when Columbia University tells this tent city, pack up at two or else, and then it's 2:01 and they are all just hanging out in the tents doing God knows what. What is going to happen tomorrow? Next week? Next month? When do they do anything about it?PIPKO: Clearly, never, right? Let me just say, I was a graduate student last year. I got my degree last May and I was kept to the same standard as everyone else, which was following the rules, which meant obviously no plagiarism, for example, citing sources, even things like making sure that my medical records were up to date and sent to the school and if they were not sent to my school, I didn't get to go to graduation. I didn't get to go to class. I didn't get to enjoy the freedoms of being a student.I'm not understanding why things like medical records, policies regarding submitting those to the school are taken to a higher standard compared to policies regarding threatening other students or trespassing in this case.WATTERS: Yes, we've now been told we're allowed to plagiarize, and chant "Kill Jews," and that's fine at universities in the United States.This is a wild time to be alive, Elizabeth. Hopefully, it gets better before it gets worse.Thank you so much for coming on PRIMETIME.PIPKO: Agreed. Thank you.WATTERS: Kamala, Seinfeld, and Obama ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Joe Biden took Kamala off ice today sending her to Atlanta to pitch their economic opportunity tour, which are really just Trump's opportunity zones that they plagiarized.Kamala is telling black voters reelect Joe and we will pump cash into your neighborhoods. This may actually help with her name recognition, considering the Black voters Johnny talks to can't even pick her out of a lineup.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Who is this?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't (bleep) know. Who the (bleep) is that?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know she's a Black woman.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know who that is.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who the (bleep) is that?BELISARIO: How's Kamala doing?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Kamala?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Bleep) Harris, dude.BELISARIO: How proud are you of Kamala Harris?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Pouts)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All she does is laugh.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What has she done for my community?BELISARIO: Kamala Harris loves her electric buses.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We don't need that, Camila.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She loves a lot of things, she don't love her people.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Democrats know Kamala is a hot mess, but they are stuck with her. They need to get it together. I mean, not a book plug, but they need to.The DNC tested Kamala with focus groups to figure out why she is unlikable. It turns out, it's this --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: And then I have a follow up on Afghanistan.KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Okay. (Cackles)(Cackling)HARRIS: You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? (Cackles)(Cackling)HARRIS: Some people understand what I'm talking about.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That cackle is hard to handle, but Kamala doesn't care. She is leaning into it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HARRIS: You were asking me earlier about what it means to be like the first woman and you know, it is funny because people still got to get used to this, right?I mean my staff for example sometimes, they'll show me a little things just to amuse me. Like, apparently some people love to talk about the way I laugh.DREW BARRYMORE, TALK SHOW HOST: Oh, yes.HARRIS: Okay.BARRYMORE: I love your laugh.HARRIS: Well, let me just tell you something, I have my mother's laugh and I grew up around a bunch of women in particular who laughed from the belly.You know, I'm never going to be like this. It's just -- I am not that person.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: See what she did there? Hating Kamala's laugh is sexist. But don't worry, they're hard at work rebranding Kamala for the 19th time.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARRYMORE: We all need a mom. I've been thinking that we really all need a tremendous hug in the world right now.But in our country, we need you to be Momala of the country. We need a great protector.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Joining me now, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.Speaker, do we really need the great protector? Momala?NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL POLITICAL ANALYST: That's almost cruel.I mean, the idea of cutting from we need a great protector and have Kamala there is like insane. She has this problem. She is serving with the most unpopular president in the history of the Gallup poll, according to the last quarter, and she is less popular than the most unpopular president.WATTERS: Yes.GINGRICH: Now, that poses a certain challenge for how you rebuild, particularly because we've had three-and-a-half years to learn, but she can't learn anything. I mean, the truth is when you listen to her for a while, it's somewhere between sophomoric and eighth grade and I think it's a nervous giggle.I think she laughs because she's nervous. And frankly, when I listen to her, I get nervous too, because she is the vice president of the United States and the idea of her being vice president, I find pretty frightening.WATTERS: I do, too and I will not be going along with the rebranding. I will still call her Kamala Harris, not Momala, out of respect for my own mother, who is a great protector, and someone else needs protecting and that's the press because Barack Obama, former president really wants everybody to be nice to the press, because he says speaker that the press usually get everything right. Listen.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)OBAMA: There's a difference between facts and opinions.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.OBAMA: And the one thing that our side still pretty much sticks to is the facts. You may not agree with whatever is in "The New York Times," or whatever is on MSNBC. But generally, they're not going to just make stuff up.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: They're not going to just make stuff up.GINGRICH: I mean, what's frightening about this is that Barack Obama probably believes it. He lives in a fantasy world. You know, he's off in that gigantic mansion. And he, I suspect doesn't go grocery shopping. If he did, he'd understand that the real problem for Joe Biden is called reality.It's the reality of crime. It is the reality of the border collapsing. It is the reality of gasoline and grocery prices. It's the reality of a world that's in chaos. And now, of course, it's the reality of students all over the country who have gone crazy, and the natural culmination of left wing ideological brainwashing on our campuses.So, you know, I think for Obama, none of that exists. Because he -- you know, he lives in a nice little isolated world surrounded by people who say, yes, you really are brilliant, Mr. President, and he believes them.WATTERS: You know, who doesn't say it? Michelle. Everybody else tells him he is brilliant except her. All right, it is kind of funny that --GINGRICH: Well, I don't actually know what she says to him.WATTERS: Yes. I don't know either and I don't need to know that's none of my business. Newt Gingrich, thanks for coming on.GINGRICH: Great to be with you.WATTERS: Johnny hits the beach.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Who is the Vice President of the United States?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joe Biden.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: One of the reasons "Seinfeld" was such a success was because nothing was off limits.("SEINFELD" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)SEINFELD: She had man hands.ELAINE BENES, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: Man hands?SEINFELD: Hands of a man.The comedian and his longtime companion seem to be inseparable. I've been outed, I wasn't even in.GEORGE COSTANZA, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: Now everyone's going to think we're gay.SEINFELD: Not that there's anything wrong with that.Excuse me. You must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why must I know? Because I'm Chinese? You think I know where all the Chinese restaurant are?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Seinfeld himself says his show would never fly today. The networks would just water down every edgy joke. We would have never met the soup Nazi.The left made comedy boring. We can't even laugh at ourselves anymore. Jerry has had enough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEINFELD: Nothing really affects comedy. People always need it. They need it so badly and they don't get it.You just expect it. There will be some funny stuff we can watch on TV tonight. Well, guess what? Where is it? This is the result of the extreme left and PC crap and people worrying so much about offending other people.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: He went on to say there are too many cooks in the kitchen and dozens of executives strip the edginess out of every single crack. If "Seinfeld" was that safe, we never would have met J. Peterman.("SEINFELD" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)PETERMAN: My friends, a toast, as the woolly haired Melanesians of Papua New Guinea once said (gibberish).(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: You can hear Uncle Bosie laughing from the grave.Mr. Peterman himself, "Seinfeld" actor John O'Hurley joins PRIMETIME.all right, O'Hurley, I mean, you couldn't do --JOHN O'HURLEY, ACTOR: Hi.WATTERS: You couldn't do cannibal jokes today?O'HURLEY: Well, somebody can, but they have to have been real.WATTERS: Or you have to be president to make jokes like that.O'HURLEY: Actually, it reminds me of a time when I was there in Papua New Guinea with a little naked natives of Bangtubesh presenting them with my annual mission of charitable giving. I gave them a toto wash less toilet. Yes. eco-friendly and elegant even under the canopy of a tropical rainforest.WATTERS: I miss J. Peterman so much. I really do.O'HURLEY: I do, too.WATTERS: The rickshaw that the homeless were using for I think it was Kramer, he said they have nothing else to do. Strap some rickshaws to -- I mean, homeless jokes are probably a no go zone now.O'HURLEY: Well, not only that they have stripped -- there are several actual episodes of "Seinfeld" that had been stripped from the syndication because they didn't pass muster back then. So --WATTERS: Could you tell us about some of these long lost --O'HURLEY: I think it was the Puerto Rican Flag Day, I think was the -- was that the one with -- I was in that actually, I don't remember what I did. But I do remember that never showing up again.WATTERS: Well, they probably took it out because you were in it.O'HURLEY: And I shouldn't take that personally.WATTERS: No, of course not.O'HURLEY: And I won't.WATTERS: And you shouldn't. So John, when you hear Jerry talk about that? I mean, he seems sad. I mean, he seems like it's never coming back. Is comedy coming back?O'HURLEY: Well, it's an interesting question, because, you know, Jerry, of course, more than anyone had a more accessible and clean platform of comedy. I mean, there wasn't a cleaner comic in the business in the last 50 years of our, you know, our laughs and for him to say that, and he said this about 10 years ago, when he said, I no longer am doing college campuses, he says, they're mean spirited. And he says, okay, and that was 10 years ago.And now, the problem is that we have lost our ability to be silly. That's a sad thing when you think about it. Just let the shoulders go loose and say something silly about yourself. I have a whole show or I mean, my one-man- show is just all self-deprecation and it's safe, because I can make fun of myself.So, you know, I'm hitting myself before anybody else can take a shot at me.WATTERS: And there's a lot of material --O'HURLEY: We have lost our sense of humor. There really is. I am a walking self-parody.WATTERS: So John, you're saying, are some people afraid of offending other people because if a Puerto Rican guy says fine, make fun of me or a Hispanic guy says, sure, you know, come get some. You know, every race, gender, creed, color, whatever. They're fine with making fun of themselves. I think we're all sensitive of making fun of others.O'HURLEY: Historically, ethnic groups who would be searching to be included in the comic repertoire of our culture. And now no, no, no, no, we can't. And it's not that they don't want it. It's that there's a select group of those who know better, who feel as though they should be deprived of it.Our comedy is no longer silly. It's not about that. It's mocking and it's sarcasm and that's not comedy.WATTERS: Right. We've got to make America silly again. Let's run on that. Thank you so much, John.
