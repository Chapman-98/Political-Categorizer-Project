LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: All right, we have a lot to cover tomorrow night. The trial will continue next week -- tomorrow is Barron's graduation. Happy graduation, Barron -- but it will back on Monday and so we'll be covering it then.Remember it is America now and forever. JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME, next.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER ATTORNEY TO DONALD TRUMP: Do I think that Donald Trump is insane? Has the guy got (bleep) crazy?I believe that Donald Trump has actually lost his (bleep).WATTERS: Michael Cohen cross-examined and destroyed.ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, "ANDERSON COOPER: 360": Michael Cohen was cornered in what appeared to be a lie.JIMMY FALLON, "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON" HOST: Biden and Trump will meet June 27th on CNN and one of Biden's debate conditions was not having an audience. So, that explains why it's on CNN.(LAUGHTER)WATTERS: Will Trump demand a drug test before the debate?DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He's on some kind of an enhancement in my opinion.TIFFANY WILLOUGHBY-HERARD, PROFESSOR OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE: These police officers out here today, that's thousands of students scholarships.What job do I have if the students don't have a future?WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday.Plus --JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: You're okay with paying the bill for a man?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely. Want to go to lunch?WATTERS: It's Day 18 in the trial for a crime the Democrats still haven't named. Michael Cohen suffering under a blistering cross examination today, and oh boy, did he fall apart.The prosecution's entire case rested on one phone call that Michael Cohen says took place. Cohen testified that he called Trump's head of security and told him that the Stormy payment was taken care of. That was the big link between Trump and the money.Today, it came out, the call never happened.Trump's defense lawyers showed Cohen a sheet of text messages on the night he claims he made that call. It turns out, Cohen had been getting prank calls from a 14-year-old and called Trump's security chief to ask if he could sic the Secret Service on him.Trump's defense attorney raising his voice zeroing in on Cohen: "That was a lie. You did not talk to President Trump." Cohen panicked, shifted in his seat, voice cracking. "I'm not certain that's accurate." But the call logs don't lie.It was a Perry Mason moment.Sources inside the courtroom tell us the entire jury's jaw hit the floor. And Never Trumper George Conway put his hands to his face and stared at the ceiling. CNN couldn't believe it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COOPER: Michael Cohen was -- was cornered in what appeared to be a lie.ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: I don't think I've ever seen a star cooperating witness get his knees chopped out quite as clearly and dramatically as what just happened with Michael Cohen.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This does seem pretty bad, though.BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: This -- this does seem I feel like there are a lot of questions that have been raised.COOPER: I think if I was a juror, in this case, watching that, I would think this guy is making this up as he is going along.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Donald Trump called it fascinating.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it was a very interesting day. It was a fascinating day and it shows what a scam this whole thing is. And I'm spending a lot of time and I'm spending a lot of money, which is what they want.They want me to spend my time and my money, and I'm willing to do it because ultimately we have to fight for the Constitution.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The entire testimony was a disaster. Trump's lawyer played for the jury. Michael Cohen sounding like a lunatic on his podcast, a very different Michael Cohen from what the jury had seen inside of court.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)COHEN: I truly (bleep) hope that this man ends up in prison. It won't bring back the year that I lost or the damage done to my family. But revenge is a dish best served cold.And you better believe I want this man to go down and rot inside for what he did to me and my family.He is about to get a taste of what I went through, and I promise you it's not fun.(END AUDIO CLIP)WATTERS: Jurors peered up at Cohen while the tape played. They were embarrassed for him. Cohen looked down at the ground, also embarrassed.Imagine being a juror listening and realize you just spent your whole month away from work, away from your family to listen to a case in which the star witness is exposed as a fanatic seeking revenge on the defendant.The defense caught Cohen in lie after lie. At one point, the lawyer says, did you ever ask for a pardon? Cohen says no. Then the lawyer pulled out a deposition where Cohen asked for a pardon. The whole courtroom just shakes their head.The defense painted a picture of a jilted lawyer who'd been passed over for White House chief-of-staff and who even had a hard time getting tickets to the inauguration.Cohen was suicidal and was forced to admit under oath that he had a vendetta against Trump. If you're a juror and you hear the star witness say that, not good. Michael Cohen's former lawyer told Fox this morning that Cohen said he never had anything on Trump, which would make sense because if Cohen did have dirt on Donald, he would have handed it to the Fed's on a silver platter to stay out of prison.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOB COSTELLO, ATTORNEY: Besides making that statement, I swear to God, I don't have anything on Donald Trump. He also said more times than that answer, guys, I want you to understand, I will do whatever the eff I have to do, I will never spend a day in jail, and then he'd slam his hand on the conference room table.And what does that mean to you? That means this guy is saying, I will lie, cheat, steal, do whatever I have to do. I'm not going to jail.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACDONALD: As Johnnie Cochran said, if it doesn't fit, you must acquit, and nothing here seems to fit. Bragg's whole case is hanging on a liar, a phone call that never happened and a crime that no one can name. Bragg hasn't offered any proof that this payment was a campaign finance violation that Trump knew or believed it was a campaign finance violation. And then he willfully falsified business records to cover it up. How do you cover up a crime that doesn't exist?Fox News legal editor Kerri Kupec Urbahn joins me now. All right, Miss Urbahn, what was it like in the courtroom today when that moment came, where that phone call maybe didn't happen?KERRI KUPEC URBAHN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL LEGAL EDITOR: It was a little bit like "My Cousin Vinnie."WATTERS: Yes.URBAHN: Yes, and very intense. Everyone was paying very close attention. Cohen was uncomfortable.And you know, just for Todd Blanche, Donald Trump's lawyer to say, "You lied, didn't you?" It was -- you know, it was quite a moment. It was made for TV in a lot of ways.But you know, it was interesting about those text messages that we all looked at. And this was part of his case as to why Trump never even had this phone call with -- I'm sorry, Cohen did not have a phone call with Trump -- is that this 14-year-old who was apparently pranking Michael Cohen, Cohen was bullying him back. It was unbelievable.He was -- this kid started begging, please don't tell my parents. Please don't call the Secret Service. I mean, in all caps, begging him, and he was like, give me your parents number, your guardian's number. He was relentless and that kid was apologizing saying he was sorry, he didn't realize what he was doing and so he was going after him.WATTERS: So he is an unhinged monster that calls the Secret Service on a prank phone call from 14-year-old. When the jury hears that, do you just see them putting their hands and like just covering their eyes?URBAHN: Well, yes, because they put the text messages up in front of us and I am thinking this guy is a psycho. You know, when we first heard the audio where he is, you know, screaming like a lunatic, like a used car salesman, you know, gleefully anticipating Donald Trump going to jail, we are watching him on these text messages bully his 14-year-old kid.Then it turns out that phone call may never even have happened, which the case, the state's case really hinges on that in a lot of ways.WATTERS: What was the state doing when this whole thing was happening? Was Bragg looking for food in his bag and just eating his feelings away? What was he saying?URBAHN: The state was objecting a lot this morning.WATTERS: Objecting.URBAHN: They were objecting a lot because it was one part of the -- you know, at certain points, it was a little hard to follow. But then I realized it's because we were going through lie after lie after lie and inconsistent statements galore.And so after a while, you're thinking, okay, which lie was this? I have to remember where we're at, at this point. What year was this lie? That's really how it felt.WATTERS: All right, so they're losing track of lies. They're piling so high. There's today, I think is you're going to be off tomorrow because of the graduation.URBAHN: That's right.WATTERS: Back on Monday. They are going to finish them off possibly on Monday? Maybe one last bite?URBAHN: Maybe. You know, it's an open question as to whether the former president is going to testify. Of course, if he were to do that, which I would not recommend.WATTERS: No.URBAHN: That would change the schedule, but right now, it looks like the evidence can be presented in full. The cases rests on Monday. Maybe it goes through a jury on Tuesday. Maybe we get a verdict on Thursday.WATTERS: Wow.URBAHN: But we will see.WATTERS: You hear that?URBAHN: That's aggressive.WATTERS: A Thursday verdict prediction.URBAHN: Aggressive.WATTERS: All right, thank you so much, Kerri Urbahn.The former president didn't show up to court alone this morning, he came with a posse and the posse is getting bigger.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): This is a made up crime. No other Americans in the country would be charged with this type of crime. It's like the Mr. Potatohead doll of crimes where they had to stick together a bunch of things that did not belong together.REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL): We have a judge whose daughter is making money, we have a judge whose family is enriching themselves on what's happening today. Any judge worth their salt would have recused themselves.REP. ANNA PAULINA LUNA (R-FL): It is corrupt lawfare. It's the Biden prosecutions and Biden, you're going to lose this election cycle.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna was in the courtroom and she joins me now.All right, Congresswoman, so you've heard everything about this case. Today, you were there for the first time. What was it like?LUNA: You know, interestingly enough, when Cohen started to be asked on whether or not he thought that New York had a corrupt judicial system, he actually had his own quotes used against them. And Judge Merchan actually was sitting there uncomfortably moving in his seat.You know, Jesse, we found out just today just to put it in perspective about how swampy, how stacked against the odd, how corrupt this entire Biden trial is because that's really what it is. And we found out that Representative Goldman who actually sits with me on House Oversight as a Democrat, not only prepared Cohen for the testimony today, but he is also a client of the judge's daughter at the same firm that fundraisers for Kamala Harris.So when I say that this is incestual, and when I say that we are exposing them for everything that they are, which is a complete sham, I mean it.And that although the president may not be able to speak on behalf of this trial, I can, and what I can tell the American people is the president is in fighting spirits. He knows that he's going to win.The jurors sat there and shook their heads every single time, all four times that Cohen admitted that he lied to members of Congress. So, to put it in perspective, I think that their trial is falling apart, again.WATTERS: All right, so the jury is shaking their head, and even the judge, you say, was shifting in his seat because they played some sound of Cohen trashing judges, trashing the New York judicial system, and the judge is sitting right there.LUNA: Correct. In fact, he got uncomfortable, you could see his body language shifting. And really, you saw the jurors face and realizing that look, if Cohen is saying this who is a known liar, what we can tell you is, it is not by any chance or circumstance that this same judge, Judge Merchan is also overseeing the Steve Bannon trial.I mean, look how many judges they have that are sitting on the bench. And all of a sudden, this judge just so happens to take all of these cases tied to Trump. It's a sham.But what I am happy to say is that the media is forced to cover this. The president has a great team representing him. And members of Congress aren't just going to sit by and let them lie about the president.They try to control the narratives. They're trying to keep cameras out there or out of the courtroom so that the American people don't see what's happening, but we're going to share those facts with you guys.WATTERS: It's good that you guys showed up. I expected more members of Congress, members of the Senate maybe to show up and I'm sure the president appreciated the support.Did you get a chance to say hi.LUNA: Oh, most certainly. In fact, we were with him, not just at Trump Tower, but we actually rode in the motorcade with him over to the courtroom. We were behind-the-scenes with him.And then also, some of us had to come back to vote on contempt for Merrick Garland tonight, but Representative Gaetz stayed with him. He's in great spirits. But I mean, the fact that they are doing this, you know, I'm getting frustrated with Congress because I don't want to just do messaging bills.WATTERS: Yes, I think we're all frustrated with Congress, not you specifically, but maybe some others, or as a body.Thank you so much, Congresswoman.LUNA: Thanks.WATTERS: Co-host of "The Five," Judge Jeanine Pirro is here.All right, Judge, your batting cleanup, anything you've heard today so far that you think you might want to weigh in on?JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: I think that one of the most significant things that happened today is what everyone has been talking about and that is when Michael Cohen says he called Keith Schiller, the former president's bodyguard to speak to the president, right? Except we know from text messages and other information that he was actually in communication with Keith Schiller at exactly that time, about a 15-year- old, 14-year-old boy who was bothering him.Here's my concern.Now, when the defense attorney -- when Blanche says, isn't it in fact that you were lying about that? He said, no, I spoke to Donald Trump and told him I had the Stormy Daniels thing done. It was a done deal. The problem is, if he didn't have that information of those text messages, and the prosecutor knew that that information was coming out, was the prosecutor suborning perjury? Was the Manhattan DA's Office suborning perjury, allowing Michael Cohen to get on the stand and say during those 96 seconds that he was speaking to the president about Stormy Daniels when in truth, all of the evidence that you interlace the text messages show, he was talking to Keith Schiller about this 14-year-old.WATTERS: So does it mean that the prosecution maybe thought that this wasn't going to come out?PIRRO: Yes. I think that.WATTERS: And then they just hung this guy out to dry hoping on cross, it wouldn't come up and then bang, he just perjured himself.PIRRO: I wouldn't go so far as to say they were hanging him out to dry. They were propping him up as much as they could.WATTERS: They were propping -- they were pushing him out, right.PIRRO: Yes, you know, go out there. Let's make sure that we convict Donald Trump. Look --WATTERS: That speaks to the corruption of the prosecution.PIRRO: Look, do I have to say more? They have a case that is beyond the statute of limitations, they have come to the end of their case, they have not proved a prima facie case. Any defense attorney worth his or her salt would stand up and say, Your Honor, I would request a directed verdict of not guilty based upon the lack of evidence.Anyone out there, ask yourself, has anyone heard any evidence that Donald Trump had anything to do with the bookkeeping of the books in the Trump administration and that he was directing how Michael Cohen be paid? No.We know from all of the witnesses that Donald Trump just signed checks that came from New York, because he was running the country and the Trump Organization.WATTERS: How many billion dollar CEOs are marking their books every time -- every quarter?PIRRO: Yes.WATTERS: Legal expense -- no. No one does that if they are the president.PIRRO: Well, actually, it was going to Michael Cohen, but the president is not a book informer.WATTERS: Right.PIRRO: The president is not a bookkeeper.WATTERS: He is not a bookkeeper.PIRRO: Here's the bottom line, we don't even know what the crime is that they're alleging that bootstraps this into a felony. And at the end of the day, everyone on the prosecution case helped the president. They all said that he was concerned about Melania, he was a great boss, and this guy is a dirtbag.WATTERS: You know what else we don't know?PIRRO: What?WATTERS: What prima facia means.PIRRO: That is evidence on its face.WATTERS: I am speaking for myself.PIRRO: On its face, the proof of a crime. They haven't even made the fundamental first hurdle.WATTERS: All right, I need a dictionary when judges come on the show.PIRRO: Okay.WATTERS: Thank you very much, Judge Pirro. We'll see you tomorrow on "The Five."PIRRO: I will be there.WATTERS: You better.PIRRO: Okay.WATTERS: And I could drag in line --PIRRO: And then where are we going after that?WATTERS: Well, you're going to a party.PIRRO: Yep. We are.WATTERS: We're not going to tell you where.PIRRO: No.WATTERS: Too many men.Johnny, Mr. Manners.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Why do men hold the door open for women?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To look at their ass.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Fox News Alert: Joe Biden's cash is mysteriously disappearing. We just got our hands on Biden's financial disclosure.In 2022, the President had between 900 grand and $2 million in cash. Last year, Biden reported between $700,000.00 and $1.4 million in cash.How is the president of the United States going through that much cash that fast? He has two homes with low rates and everything else in his life is paid for.He also took out a quarter million dollar line of credit on his house. What does he need that much cash for? And where is it going?Is it to pay lawyers for the special counsel investigation or to pay Hunter's lawyers? Or to pay someone else?Today, we found out Hunter Biden's lawyer doesn't have enough resources to defend him, because Hunter's sugar brother, Kevin Morris is tapped out. After loaning Hunter over $6 million, no more sugar and Hunter is in debt up to his eyeballs and has two trials in the same month.June 3rd is the felony gun charge in Delaware, and June 20th are the tax charges in LA. President Joe Biden is terrified that Hunter is going to be sentenced to prison: "He worries about Hunter every single day from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep that will only pick up during a trial."Biden is going to have to pardon Hunter this year after the election. whether he wins or loses. And Hunter trials are going to collide with the first debate in June. The president's son could be freshly convicted on felony gun charges and in court on tax evasion charges while he walks onto the debate stage.Biden needed to debate early to give a jolt to his sagging campaign and to give him room to recover in the summer if he bombs. But if he does, maybe no one will notice.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FALLON: The first debate will be next month, which is the earliest presidential debate has ever been, and if we're being honest, an early bird debate feels right for these guys.(LAUGHTER)FALLON: Yes, Biden and Trump will meet June 27th on CNN and one of Biden's debate conditions was not having an audience. So, that explains why it's on CNN.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Nancy Pelosi doesn't think Biden debating Trump is a good idea at all.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I myself would never recommend going on stage with Donald Trump, but the president has decided that's what he wants to do, I think format he is suggesting is a good one.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Of course, Nancy likes the mute button, Tapper moderating, and no audience. No one is confident in sending Joe into a live two-hour debate. His own White House doesn't even want the public to hear him talk.I think both candidates should probably agree to a drug test beforehand just to make sure nobody is juicing in the locker room.Remember, when Special Counsel Robert Hur interviewed Joe about his sloppy classified docs in his open garage and determined he was too mentally unfit to be charged, those interviews were recorded.But today Biden just blocked the tapes from being released. They don't want us to hear the president sounding diminished, so they exerted executive privilege. They revoked Trump's privilege to keep documents he was entitled to and then invoked privilege to hide Biden being interviewed about documents he wasn't entitled to.We don't see how anything gets any better for Biden. His son is facing two trials, inflation is not going down, the border is still open, Russia just broke through the lines in Ukraine, and Hamas is digging in and shifting the guerrilla warfare. The Democrats are even considering taking some of their convention virtual to avoid protests.Some Democrats even want to cancel the convention -- not Michelle.Kayleigh McEnany is a former White House press secretary and co-host of "Outnumbered."Where do you think Joe Biden is losing all that cash to?KAYLEIGH MCENANY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Well, I think you hit the nail on the head. I mean, legal bills. This is not inexpensive.Kevin Morris, to your point has spent all he can. I mean, who gives someone a $6 million loan, first of all?WATTERS: Right.MCENANY: That's what he did for these legal bills. And you know, Joe Biden shelling some of this out, too. So I've got to figure it's that or the double chocolate chip ice cream that he eats way too much. But I would think that Hunter Biden's finger paints would do something in the way of compensating these guys.I mean, $500,000.00 a painting, and he was apparently selling a lot of them? I mean, that adds up quick, Jesse.WATTERS: That does add up quick and how is a $6 million loan -- it's not a loan -- how is $6 million not election interference? How is that not a campaign contribution when you're trying to affect an election so you keep your -- the president's son out of prison? I don't know where the FEC is on that one, but we're going to have to look into it.What about this debate? Is this thing really going to happen? Do you think we're going to see two? We're going to see one? We're going to see three?MCENANY: So I initially thought zero, but now I think two, I think Joe Biden committed, he's dug in. He has to do that. But there's no way he does any more than that. There's just no way.Unless, Jesse, the expectations are so low. Biden, all he has to do is not fall over. He just needs the State of the Union cocktail, whatever that was. I'm going to guess here that there was some sort of something, even if it was just Red Bull, some sort of something that got him through the teleprompter.WATTERS: A lot of Red Bull.MCENANY: So, yes, the State of the Union cocktail is going to be out in full force. He gets past the first, he goes to the second confident, he gets demolished in the second, and that's it. We don't see from the guy until November, unless, he is replaced at the convention, which is highly probable if he can't even get past the first debate.WATTERS: You never know. It is in Chicago.And let's talk about confidence because you can tell a lot about someone's confidence by the people around them and what they're plotting because we're now hearing that Kamala Harris has an exit plan, that if she loses this November, she may run for Governor of California.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: Have you heard --JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, nDOOCY: That Vice President Harris is telling friends that she may go back to California and run for governor if the election does not go her way?JEAN-PIERRE: That is news to me. I would say this, the Vice President has been a great partner to this president. He is appreciative of the work that she has done, it is impressive what she's been able to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: I think she just wants options, Kayleigh. What's wrong with options?MCENANY: I think that's it. Look, she told POLITICO, apparently they reported she jokes with friends about this. Let's hope it's just a joke, because I don't think you could drive California further into the ground than Gavin Newsom did, but Kamala may give him a run for his money on that.Maybe she just wants a job so she can pardon all the guys she locked up for small marijuana convictions now that she is the weed czar.But wow, I mean, you think if you fail so bad at your first job, and I think it's pretty categorical to say she failed. She's got a 30-something percent approval rating, you get the hint. Go take a lucrative job somewhere. Go run a board. She'll have all kinds of things at her disposal.But she wants to stay in the game? It's like Joe Biden, he got a taste of political life and he spent his entire life trying to make it to the top, well, he finally did. This lady has not given up.WATTERS: No, she's just like a dog with a bone. I don't know if you're right about California. I don't think anybody could be worse than Gavin, but it will be fun to see that put to the test. Thank you so much, Kayleigh.MCENANY: Oh. Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Fox News Alert: We've just confirmed that two Jordanian nationals tried to crash their way into a military base earlier this month and it was covered up.On May 3rd, the two unnamed men rolled up to Quantico in a box truck, acting like they worked at Amazon. But Military Police knew something was fishy when they couldn't show credentials, so they waved the truck over to do an inspection.And according to a base spokesman, the driver ignored their directions and tried to access the base before soldiers threw up emergency barriers in their way. The Jordanians were then detained and handed over to ICE.Was this a foiled terror plot? We have no idea. No one will tell us. No one is touching the story.Thankfully, our very own stupid son of a bitch, Peter Doocy challenged Binder to open up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: The deputy director of ICE is telling us that two Jordanian nationals are in removal proceedings now, after posing as Amazon delivery drivers to crash the gates at Quantico. Does the White House think this might have been a failed terrorist attack?JEAN-PIERRE: So we're going to be really mindful these two Jordanians that you're speaking of remain in ICE custody, and given that it is an act of law enforcement matter, so I would have to refer you to ICE. I just can't dive into this, because again, there's a law enforcement -- this is a law enforcement matter.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Oops. Wasn't in the Binder. This comes months after a Chinese illegal was caught driving onto a military base in California. We're seeing a pattern here and we'll keep you updated.A major scandal rocking the NFL. Players in big trouble, not for doing drugs, betting, or beating women, but because he is Christian.Kansas City Chiefs kicker, Harrison Butker delivered a commencement address at a small Catholic College in Kansas. During his speech, Butker talked about his faith, blasted Biden as a fake Catholic and ripped DEI.But this is what freaked out the National Football League.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HARRISON BUTKER, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS KICKER: For the ladies present today, congratulations on an amazing accomplishment.How many of you are sitting here now about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you're going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Butker said that educated young women excited to pursue a career might even be more excited to fall in love and have a family.Well, "The View" thinks he is mentally ill.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Well, I think he has mother issues. He probably was left alone because she was busy with her career. He is angry.SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": To the therapist. To the therapist.BEHAR: And this is my arm chair therapist.That's the real issue with the guy. He has big mother issues, so get a therapist.HOSTIN: There you go.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now what they won't show you is that right after saying that, the kicker started crying, gushing over his wife.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BUTKER: I'm on the stage today unable to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her vocation.I am beyond blessed with the many talents God has given me, but it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in being in class back in middle school would convert to the faith, become my wife, and embrace one of the most important titles of all, homemaker.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: No one loves women more than PRIMETIME. If women pursue careers, great. Motherhood, amazing. Balancing them both, incredible. Although, I don't love the idea of my wife going to work and being bossed around by another man.But the point is, being a husband or wife, a father or a mother is what makes us human, not what job we have. But the NFL threw a flag on the speech. They're distancing themselves from the kicker: "Harrison Butker gave a speech and his personal capacity. His views are not those of the NFL as an organization. The NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger."Wait, Colin Kaepernick trashed the cops in the whole country, the NFL didn't say anything about that. But this guy says women should look forward to marriage and they distance themselves? Do you have any idea what happens on a weekly basis in the offseason in the NFL? Arrests, car accidents, domestic disputes. I don't hear the NFL distancing.The good news is the fans are sticking with Butker. This week, his jerseys are outselling teammate, Patrick Mahomes in both men's and women's sizes.Grace Curley, host of "The Grace Curley Show" joins me now. Grace, why are they so upset about this comment?GRACE CURLEY, HOST, "THE GRACE CURLEY SHOW": It's really crazy because I understand there was a lot of the speech that people are going to have a different opinion on and that's okay. It's his point of view. He's allowed to share it.But this part in particular, Jesse, it's very disturbing that people find this so offensive because he wasn't diminishing anyone for their choices. He was raising up women who do choose to have families and letting them know that it's very fulfilling, and it brings you a different level of joy, and I don't see what's wrong with that.And actually, the response that he has received is just more confirmation that it doesn't get talked about enough. Because clearly, if this is how people react to it, that's an issue. That's something as a society that we need to figure out.Why are the women on "The View" attacking this man for gushing over his wife and explaining what a wonderful thing she does for him and his family? It's very, very strange. It's something that I think we need a therapist on "The View" to figure that whole thing out.WATTERS: Why is it offensive now to the NFL to say that women make great wives and mothers?CURLEY: I don't think anything is offensive to the NFL. As you just mentioned, I mean, they're acting like he committed a violent crime.WATTERS: Right.CURLEY: Although, no, because if he committed a violent crime, they wouldn't say anything. So clearly, they're not offended.I think the NFL is obsessed with getting people to think that they care about women. And you know what, Jesse?
