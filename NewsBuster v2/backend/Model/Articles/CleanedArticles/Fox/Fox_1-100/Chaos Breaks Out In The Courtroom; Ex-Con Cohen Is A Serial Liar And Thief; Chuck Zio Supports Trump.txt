I guess, we have pictures of your birthday cake.NIKOLAI INGRAHAM: Yes.LAURA INGRAHAM: Is it melting outside?All right, Jesse Watters and the gang takes it all from here.More Trump trial drama tomorrow. We'll cover it all. So be sure to tune in.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to Jesse Watters PRIMETIME.Tonight --JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: I'm still kind of reeling Cohen stole money from the Trump Organization.TIM PARLATORE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The prosecutor misled this jury.ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: It's a higher degree of a felony than what Donald Trump is charged with.WATTERS: Michael Cohen is a liar. And now we know he's a thief.JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Who the (bleep).JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The trail of broken promises still leave Black communities behind. You would be a Black man who loves his country, even if it doesn't love him back in equal measure.WATTERS: Biden tells Blacks that Americans don't love them.BIDEN: If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black?(WOMEN screaming)WATTERS: Why are women so angry?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let yourself erupt.WATTERS: Plus --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Don't let nobody tell you that you only need no money and money don't buy happiness because listen to me, it sure does.WATTERS: It only took 19 days, but we finally have a crime in the Trump trial. Michael Cohen, not only a liar; today, we found out, he is a thief.Alvin Bragg's star witness in another gruesome day of cross-examination confessed to larceny, admitting he stole $60,000.00 from his old boss --"You stole from the Trump Organization, correct?" With Cohen responding with a, "Yes, sir." As former President Donald Trump stared on, shaking his head.Even CNN's heads were shaking.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HONIG: This is a bomb. This is really important. This is a bomb dropped in the middle of the prosecution's case.PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: They appear to have caught Cohen in another lie.LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR AND SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: This has given such ammunition as to possibly fatally undermine the prosecution's case.TAPPER: I have to say, I'm still kind of reeling from the revelation that Michael Cohen stole money from the Trump Organization.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Jake is reeling, what do you think Bragg is doing?Trump is in a conspiracy with a guy stealing his money? Trump just became a victim. That's how the jury sees it.Michael Cohen falsified invoices to the Trump Organization, stiffed contractors, pocketed the difference and paid the contractors 20 grand in cash in a brown paper bag.MSNBC couldn't believe it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DANNY CEVALLOS, MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST: Dealing in these sandwich bags of cash, he brown paper bags them cash to pay people is already problematic, but the idea that he would just grab a wad of cash and stick it in his pocket, I think has moved Michael Cohen from this figure where he is part Tom Hagen from "The Godfather" but really more like Fredo Corleone to now this guy who is just a thief.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: When asked why he stole from Trump, Cohen said he was angry that his bonus wasn't bigger and considered taking the money almost like self- help. Cohen saw Trump's cash as free samples, pieces of cheese with toothpicks at them in the supermarket, where he could just help himself.But MSNBC redefined the world stealing -- rebalancing the bonus you think you deserve.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: It sounded a lot like Michael Cohen doing the little that he could within that calculation to rebalance the bonus he thought he deserved and it still came out as less than the bonus he thought he deserved and the bonus he had gotten the year before.(END AUDIO CLIP)WATTERS: So the producers at "The Last Word," upset with the Christmas bonus Lawrence gave you, take his wallet. Rebalance that bonus. Nothing illegal about it, except the DA calls it larceny.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HONIG: The fact that he was never charged with larceny is important because stealing $60,000.00 through fraud, which would be larceny in New York State is more serious of a crime than falsifying business.They gave him a free pass. He committed larceny. It's a higher degree of a felony than what Donald Trump is charged with.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The only proof of a crime that we have is a crime committed by the star witness, not the defendant. The only falsified business document we have on the record was falsified by Cohen, not Trump.This whole case rested on a phone call that never happened and Trump signing off on a false invoice that he didn't know about. Why would Trump sign off on an invoice that robbed him of grand? He obviously wouldn't. Obviously, Trump didn't know the invoice he was signing was falsified.And that right there destroys the entire prosecution's case, because they've argued Trump knew about everything he was signing and he clearly didn't. Trump is coming out of this as the victim of a crime committed by a free-wheeling attorney who only changed his story after the Feds raided his office and said you have 48 hours to plead guilty or you and your wife are going to go to prison.The Trump defense team then brought in Cohen's former attorney, Bob Costello, who testified that at the height of it all, Cohen was acting suicidal, very manic, and like a drama queen and told him this: "I swear to God, Bob, I don't have anything on Donald Trump."Costello said Cohen told him numerous times that President Trump knew nothing about those payments, that he did this on his own. He repeated that numerous times. And that has to be true because Cohen was getting squeezed by the Feds and if he had any dirt on Trump, he would have offered it to save his own hide and his wife's, but he never had any dirt.Judge Merchan was not really a big fan of Costello and accused him of rolling his eyes at him and then said, "Are you staring me down?" The judge lost it, kicked everybody out of the courtroom just so he could talk to Costello alone.Then the judge wouldn't let Trump's attorneys call their expert witness, the former head of the Federal Elections Commission, who was supposed to testify that this $130,000.00 NDA wasn't a campaign finance violation. The only expert witnesses the judge allows to testify apparently are porn stars.Obviously, the judge could see the prosecution losing this case and tried to save them. Trump left the courthouse moments ago quoting Shakespeare(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So you saw what we saw, that was incredible -- I've never seen anything like it in my life. This time -- this trial is a disaster for our country, it is a disaster for New York State and New York City.Where exactly is the crime? To quote to a memorable line from "Shakespeare in Love." I don't know, it's a mystery. There is just no crime.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: This whole case is falling apart, so let's check in to see how the Democrats are taking it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARVILLE: (Bleep) the legalese of it. This macho (bleep). They listen to the (bleep) judge. If you're (bleep) serious, who the (bleep) went to Alabama Baptist coming down on you.Quit (bleep) leaking stories to (bleep).(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Kerri Kupec Urbahn is a Fox News legal editor and was in the courtroom today. She joins me now.Am I saying that correctly? Am I putting a little too much flash on your last name?KERRI KUPEC URBAHN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL LEGAL EDITOR: No, I like the flash.WATTERS: You like the flash? All right.URBAHN: I like it. I like it.WATTERS: So you were in -- you saw a lot of flash cameras today. What happened when that stealing information dropped?URBAHN: It was a shocking moment. We were hitting each other saying, "Did we know this yet?" Because it was a stunning revelation. How many days into the case, and we're almost at the end of it all. The prosecution didn't front it last week.In fact, Jesse, we were all led to believe when Michael Cohen was on the stand under direct examination last week that he was just trying to get his money back and his Christmas bonus and feel bad for me, when in fact, he was stealing from Trump as he was negotiating this payment plan.So I think the real question for the jury is, is Michael Cohen, the worst witness of all time?WATTERS: It doesn't get any worse than that. He is recording his client. He's stealing from his client and he is leaking about his client. How did the jury take in this information?URBAHN: Well, it was just so startling, you know, to have a witness confess that he was stealing from the guy that he is clearly trying to get sent to jail. And the thing that he did was worse than what they're alleging his boss did, who is on trial.So we'll see how this plays.WATTERS: So this was a shock. This was a surprise.URBAHN: It was a shock, and I have to tell you, after we got through the shock of all of that, and we came back for lunch, and then the prosecution tried to rehabilitate Cohen's credibility by going through all the lies he said in the past and say, "But that wasn't true, right?" And he said, "Right, that was false."And I thought, you know, if I'm sitting here thinking, I can't even listen to this anymore after the stealing thing. I don't know what the jury must be thinking.WATTERS: So then he -- the judge -- kicks everybody out of the courtroom because the defense witness, Costello rolled his eyes. What happened?URBAHN: So it got a little testy because the prosecution was objecting every 30 seconds when the defense was asking Bob Costello questions. Now, of course, the prosecution does not want Bob Costello to speak because he can destroy their case, because as we know, he has testified before a grand jury, before Congress and he's talked about it on TV that Cohen repeatedly told him that he had nothing on Trump, and this is when allegedly he was suicidal.So if ever there was a time that he would have something on Donald Trump to get him out of the mess he was in, it would have been then, and he said he didn't have anything, oh, and he had nothing to do with the Stormy Daniels payment.The problem is every time Costello would go to open his mouth, the prosecution would jump in, "Objection, objection." And the judge sustained a lot of them. He overruled a few, but it was frustrating for Bob Costello and he started to show his frustration.He started muttering under his breath. "Ridiculous," "Geez," then he was staring at the judge and they got to the staring contest.WATTERS: Oh, a staring contest.URBAHN: Yes, it was a lot.WATTERS: All right, thank you very much. Do you know when this case is going to be over?URBAHN: You know, it looks like it's going to spill over into next week.WATTERS: Next week.URBAHN: We will see.WATTERS: Okay, so we will have a nice Memorial Day weekend. We can all chew on it. Kerri Kupec Urbahn.URBAHN: Thank you.WATTERS: Thank you.Former federal prosecutor Katie Cherkasky joins me now.Katie, Donald Trump gave you and your husband a big shoutout, said you guys were esteemed legal eagles and thinks very highly of you. He has probably seen you on this show.How did you absorb the fact that Cohen stole 60 grand from Donald Trump? And then was paying the stiffed contractor 20 grand in cash in a brown paper lunch bag?KATIE CHERKASKY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, there's no such thing as a mercy rule in a trial. But I'm starting to think that the prosecution wishes that there was because this is getting to the point of embarrassment. I mean, honestly, I don't know that they were planning to have their entire case rest on somebody so incredible the whole time.That can't possibly have been the plan, because this is just such an embarrassment of a showing of a prosecution that I can't imagine that the judge wouldn't grant the Motion to Dismiss this case, although I think we know that that's unlikely here. But realistically speaking, there has been no evidence presented on the elements of these offenses.WATTERS: Do you believe that the jury feels like they're being misled by the prosecution because the prosecution knew about this phone call that never happened? They had the call records and they knew about the larceny. And Cohen said he told the DA's Office that he stole 60 grand from Trump, but they're withholding this information from the jury and it is just -- it is spilling out in a ridiculous, embarrassing way. Why?CHERKASKY: Well, when you have a witness that has such severe credibility issues, which obviously the prosecution knew about all along, you have to literally corroborate every single word that comes out of their mouth independently, or else you cannot rely upon their testimony. Period.Whether they knew about all of these issues with the larceny and the theft, I'm assuming that they did. But certainly they did not take the sting out of that in their direct examination. They didn't even try to explain it. Michael Cohen didn't really even try to explain it. So it's very strange, for sure. But ultimately, we have to always go back to, what are the actual elements of these offenses and put aside all of the salacious details, because quite frankly, it is wasting the jury's time at this point, I think, with all of this ridiculousness.WATTERS: All right, Katie, real quick. You're a former prosecutor. If you have someone that steals 60 grand and just says, you know, I'm just rebalancing the bonus that I thought I was owed. But how do you -- what do you say to that?CHERKASKY: I like it, it's clever. I'm a defense attorney now. So I'm going to appropriate that.WATTERS: You're going to try that.CHERKASKY: That's a nice way to put a euphemism.WATTERS: Okay. Good luck with that in court. Let me know how that turns out.Katie, thank you very much.CHERKASKY: Thank you.WATTERS: Well, Donald Trump had a new entourage supporting him in court today. One of the people who showed up. Actor Chuck Zito. He used to lead the New York chapter of the Hells Angels, actor and former leader of Hells Angels, Chuck Zito joins me now.What was it like in court today?CHUCK ZITO, ACTOR: It was pretty wild, I couldn't believe it. Everything they were trying to do, the judge says, you know, sustained, strike that, I'm not accepting this. It was crazy.But then President Trump's attorney got on and when he was cross-examining Michael Cohen, and he says, last week, you said you lied under oath for your personal gain. Do you lie under oath for your personal gain? This guy's not going to -- he says, yes. And I'm saying I was ready to get a lot -- dismiss this case, it's over. I just can't believe it.WATTERS: All right, so he gets him to admit that he is lying for money.ZITO: Absolutely.WATTERS: And he's got him to admit that he is stealing from his client and he is recording his client's phone calls. Was it as cold in the courtroom as everybody says? TRUMP today called it a refrigerator?ZITO: I didn't feel like it was cold. You know --WATTERS: Because you got a lot of ice on your wrist.ZITO: Yes, I have --WATTERS: And you've got a little ice on your pinky. Show everybody what you've got going on here. Can we see this? He might not walk out of here in Manhattan after that.All right, why did you show up today to show your love?ZITO: Well, I would always support President Trump. We know each other over 40 years. I fought in the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, so we go back a long time. I'll always support him.He's the greatest president of my lifetime, I'll tell you that, and you know, he don't even need all this to go through it. He is doing it for the American people and America, not for himself.He wants to make this country great again, with all of these -- what 20 million illegal aliens came over the border. You know, they emptied all their prisons, sent them over here and he is doing it for the American people.But I'll tell you, he's a trooper, man. Nothing fazes him. He's like, he doesn't care. We were in the jury room before and after, we had lunch there and he goes, imagine what I have to go through. I should be campaigning. I should be getting ready for my debates, but this what they put me through, what are you going to do? He's going. Nothing fazes him. I thought I was a tough guy. This guy's a savage, man.WATTERS: What do you guys have for lunch?ZITO: They had a bunch of pizza pies, a bunch of everything. You know, I'm still training. So I only had one slice and a bottle of water.WATTERS: All right --ZITO: But I just can't believe what he's going through.WATTERS: It's unbelievable.ZITO: And like he says, he said he lied on the stand. And we're not talking -- we're talking millions. He is saying, he made $5 million here, $4 million there, Michael Cohen and he has been stealing the whole time, making himself money. And not only that, he sells t-shirts.WATTERS: Right.ZITO: With Trump.WATTERS: And I don't know if you picked up on this because he said he's considering Michael Cohen running for Congress.ZITO: Yes.WATTERS: Everybody, Michael Cohen, might run for Congress. Let that sink in.ZITO: He couldn't make a dog catcher.WATTERS: Let it sink in.ZITO: He couldn't make dog catcher.WATTERS: All right.ZITO: And then he's saying that they want to do his TV show on.WATTERS: Yes.ZITO: Called "The Fixer."WATTERS: "The Fixer."ZITO: Go figure.WATTERS: Go figure.All right, tuxedo everybody.ZITO: Thank you.WATTERS: Then, he'll knock you out and you'll be much richer afterwards.Johnny celebrates college graduation.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Joe Biden spent the weekend trying to slam the brakes on the black exodus. If Biden is working this hard, you know he's losing. But just because he's playing hard doesn't mean he's playing smart. In Detroit, he said he was vice president during COVID.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: When I was vice president, things were kind of bad during the pandemic, and what happened was, Barack said to me go to Detroit.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Barack Obama sent Biden to Detroit to fix the pandemic? What is he talking about? Then the president delivered a commencement address at Morehouse in Atlanta, the Historically Black College where his uplifting message was this: America is racist, and you're a victim.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: You started college just as George Floyd was murdered, and there was a reckoning on race. It's natural to wonder, democracy you hear about actually works for you.What is democracy? If Black men are being killed in the street. What is democracy? The trail of broken promises still leave Black communities behind. What is democracy? You have to be 10 times better than anyone else to get a fair shot. Most of all, what does it mean? As we've heard before, to be a Black man who loves his country even if it doesn't love him back in equal measure.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: America doesn't love you, that's the message. He also pushed another hoax.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Today in Georgia, they won't allow water to be available to you while you wait in line to vote in the election. What in the hell is that all about?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: There's no ban on water at polling stations. You just can't hand out free stuff 150 feet from where people vote. They don't want partisans passing out snacks, sodas, and freebies around polling stations. You're not even allowed to hand out free copies of my book, "Get It Together." It's the law.Biden's last pitch to win over Black grads, America hates you, but I'll hire you.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I've got more Morehouse men in the White House telling me what to do than I know what to do.(LAUGHTER)BIDEN: You all think I'm kidding, don't you? You know I'm not.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: I have Blacks bossing me around is the new, I'm not racist, I had Black friends.The pandering backfired. Students turned their back on the president in protest. PRIMETIME could only find one fan of Biden's speech.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: I thought it was a very good speech. I thought that he really made some very key points. It was a substantive speech and it was inspirational.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden is so inspirational there was zero fanfare by the way for his motorcade moving through Atlanta. A half million people in Atlanta, half of them Black, no one cares the president popped in.Here is Trump driving through New York after court today. Crowds lining the streets taking pictures.Here's Biden's motorcade driving through New York before his UN General Assembly speech. No interest.This weekend, Biden also showed up to another event in Atlanta, and we have no idea what went on here.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: The DJ had to hit the music because it got so awkward. The president should arouse excitement, not make everybody uncomfortable.Cardi B who endorsed Biden in 2020 just pulled her endorsement, she said he betrayed her. Trump is capitalizing, heading to the South Bronx this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the Democrats have been dropping the ball.A lot of bad things are happening. A lot of people can't afford groceries. And Trump is speaking to those people in those barber shops or people that just can't afford this lifestyle that they have probably four to five years ago.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Michaelah Montgomery is the state director of Blexit Georgia, who met Trump at the Atlanta Chick-Fil-A. I think you were the one that was hugging Trump. You're famous now.I think you wanted your mom to know about that.Michaelah, when you hear Joe Biden give the commencement address, and that's his message. How does that make you feel?MICHAELAH MONTGOMERY, STATE DIRECTOR, BLEXIT GEORGIA: I think it's interesting that somebody who spent the majority of their career punishing Black men and locking them up for generations to come, it's very interesting that you would then get in front of a large pool of very successful and educated Black men and try to, I guess, make up for the wrongs or act like we were supposed to forget.I think that it was a very tone deaf attempt at them trying to win over an audience who, whether he realizes it or not, has been studying his administration, has paid attention to his policies, have been aware of his actions while in office, and they're not pleased with his performance.With that being said, no matter how many times you come and make a speech and mention certain things, oh, I have Morehouse men working in the White House. Morehouse men have been working in the White House since long before you were ever there.So that I don't know what the point in bringing that up was to say that, oh, you know, America doesn't love you. It's very interesting for you of all people to say that considering it was you who passed the bills that made us feel unloved.And I just wonder how he could stand there and feel safe knowing that at one point in time, he would refer to that entire audience as a large pool of super predators. And I remember vaguely him saying that he didn't want his kids to go to school with those same kids that were graduating, because that would turn the school into some racial jungle.So regardless of what he got up there and said, not one time that he apologized for what he's done. So I don't think that any speech he could have given at the office or any campaign strategy in regards to engaging with HBCUs will undo his wrongs of the past and considering he has had for years to try and write them and he didn't, it is going to take a lot more than a speech for us to like you.WATTERS: Yes, so Trump has been in Atlanta. Now, he's campaigning in the Bronx soon. Why do you think former President Trump is getting traction in the African American community?MONTGOMERY: Because much like our Bronx girl, Cardi B, they're disappointed with Biden's performance. So not saying that Cardi B of course endorsed Trump, she said she's not voting for anybody. But if you have people who went so hard for Biden, the same people who recorded themselves crying when he won the election, are now saying that they are very disappointed and they would rather not vote than vote for him says a lot.Because everybody knows if there's two people running and you don't vote for one, that's pretty much you giving your vote to the other person.WATTERS: You're exactly right.MONTGOMERY: So whether or not you outwardly say you support Trump, if you're not voting, you're definitely giving Trump your vote.WATTERS: Alright, Michaelah, who should have been the commencement speaker at Morehouse, maybe next year, go give her a shot.MONTGOMERY: You've got to wait. They'll call me.WATTERS: We love her. Thank you. Have a good night.New details on Diddy right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Fox News Alert: Disgraced hip-hop mogul P. Diddy HAS broken his silence after the release of a video from 2016 showing him beating his then girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, at an LA hotel.The attack shocking and disgusting, but Diddy wants you to know he is sorry and that deep down, he's a stand-up guy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEAN "DIDDY" COMBS, RAPPER: It is so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life. Sometimes you've got to do that. I was (bleep) up. I mean, I hit rock bottom. I make no excuses.My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I went and I sought out professional help. I had to go into therapy and going to rehab, but I'm committed to be a better man each and every day.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Diddy is on tape confessing to a brutal domestic assault, but he's not going to face any charges for it. The LA DA says the statute of limitations has run out. So Diddy is going to skate after he beats a woman on camera in 2016, but Trump is charged with 34 felonies over paperwork in 2016.Harrison Butker is the second best kicker in NFL history. He's helped Kansas City win three Super Bowls, but now the Kansas City Star Newspaper wants him fired for telling female college grads, they're probably excited to fall in love and have families.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HARRISON BUTKER, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS: Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.I can tell you that my beautiful wife Isabel would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So the Kansas City media wants their own team to fire the league's best kicker and replace him with a woman. For poetic justice, after Harrison Butker's Neanderthal outburst, and because the pipeline of talent is real, the Kansas City Chiefs next kicker should be a woman. This is not a joke. It is not unrealistic, and it would be good for business.How would losing games with a female kicker be good for business? The paper thinks Sarah Fuller should kick for the Chiefs. Great athlete, soccer star, but Sarah Fuller played one game of football in college, one game and she never made a single field goal. She never even attempted one. Here she is kicking off.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER: History is on the field in Columbia, Missouri, as Sarah Fuller is about to put her right foot into a football.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Okay. This is the definition of DEI. Fire a qualified White man and hire someone who can't fill his shoes, that's poetic justice.Men and women are built differently. Want proof? Go to Portland, where a trans high school track star is crushing his female competition. He is the top runner in the state in the girls division and he is getting booed.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: Parents have had it. One mom says her daughter has been warned stay quiet and lose to a man or get banned for life.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My daughter has been first in her year and she has to compete with (bleep) who just won first at state and took away spots from our girls.A lot of parents are afraid to speak out because there is an announcement from OSAA that if you discriminate or if you put anyone down for their gender or talk negative, they can disqualify the children from events.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Fitness expert, Jillian Michaels joins PRIMETIME. Let's start with the kicker. So they're going to get rid of the guy and they're going to put a female soccer player who's never kicked a single field goal in college on the -- I guess the last team that won the Super Bowl.JILLIAN MICHAELS, FITNESS EXPERT: Yes, yes.Well, here's the good news, Jesse, is that there was a study published in Sports Med that actually assess the possibility for such things to happen. And in fact, football kicker was one of the sports they looked at. And men had a 16 to 22 percent advantage over women in kicking a football.So I don't know how realistic that is, and more to the point, is a person who probably couldn't be more different than said kicker, I'm a female businesswoman. I'm gay. I'm not religious. I really don't understand what this man said that has everybody calling for his head.Somebody tell me what I'm missing when there are literally children on a college campus down the street calling for the death of all Jews, but we're protecting their First Amendment rights. But this guy lives a little different than you, has different opinions than you and we want his life ruined.What the hell is going on?WATTERS: Yes, Joe Biden tells college grads, America is racist, and it doesn't love you. And then this kicker says you're probably excited to have kids and maybe fall in love. And this guy is on the chopping block and Biden is, he could be president again.What about this trans runner? How about the trans runner that is smoking all the women and if you raise a stink, you're canceled.MICHAELS: I completely agree with you. I think the world has lost its mind and that's why it's important that we have guys like you out there putting these issues front and center.WATTERS: I mean, that was the best answer you could have possibly given. We just need more guys like me.Jillian Michaels, you're welcome back here anytime.MICHAELS: Thank you, Jesse.WATTERS: Thank you.Why are women so mad?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(WOMEN screaming)(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: primetime knows that without women, society falls apart, so it's very important to keep them happy. But these days women are very upset. Why? Mystery. Probably something we did.And instead of complaining they're doing something strange. Women are going into the woods and screaming.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(WOMEN screaming)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That was a rage ritual where women pay thousands of dollars to scream in the forest and bash the earth with sticks and stones. It's intense and cathartic.And for some women, it's the release they've been looking for.Ritual leader Mia Magik, who also moonlights as a witch says women have a hot fury bubbling up inside them that needs to be let out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIA MAGIK WITCH: Rage has been demonized and villainized especially in the feminine, but our sacred rage is what has incited so many movements, created so much change on our planet.It is imperative that we allow ourselves safe spaces to release this fiery hot emotion from within us so that it can no longer poison or toxify our internal emotional reality.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Mia Magik joins us now.All right, Mia, why are these women that are participating in these rituals so angry?MAGIK: You know, Jesse, there is so much that has happened in the world over the last several years. I think a lot of people, it's not just women, a lot of people are angry, they're depressed, they're sad. They're afraid, they're uncertain.And women in particular come to my retreats and experiences to help themselves heal. I read your book over the weekend and I really agree with so many of the things that you said about self-sabotage and self-esteem and the common denominator being the father, and you're a great dad, but a lot of women didn't grow up with men who care about them.They grew up with men who abused them and talked down to them and spoke unkindly to them, and they maybe never had an opportunity to stand up for themselves, and so this gives them a really safe space to individually and collectively release some of the anger that they've perhaps been burdened by for their entire life.WATTERS: Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I like you, witch, and not just because you've read my book, but because you're giving these women an outlet, and I think that's fine. But you say a lot has happened in the last -- is it the pandemic? Are a lot of these women's single? Is it Gaza? What is it exactly that are driving these women into the woods to scream?MAGIK: It's everything, and the retreat is a week long experience. The rage ritual is one hour in the whole week. But it's all of that, it's everything that you just mentioned.And I love when you spoke to Caitlyn, the mommy blogger in Missouri, you told her when you feel rageful, let it out, directed appropriately. And where really is the option for women to do that? There isn't an appropriate direction.And so I want to offer something like that. I want to allow people the support, to work towards happiness, you said happiness is -- it takes work and it does.And so this is the kind of work that I have found within myself and within my students and clients where when you do this work, it leads to really lasting, sustainable, fulfilling happiness because of the impact that it has on your ability to come home to your community, transformed and calmer and more at ease because you've released some of what has been holding you back for your whole life that's self-sabotage.WATTERS: What can men do to help women be less rageful? Because we're in this together.MAGIK: Yes, absolutely, 100 percent. For men, I think it's more sadness. And the thing is, as nature actually counteracts the impacts of anger and trauma on the body, and so men can support women by listening to them, holding them, asking them what they need for support, by being vulnerable with their own emotions. You know, men tend to feel --WATTERS: Wait, wait. You're saying a lot really fast. So we have to write this down. You said listening, holding --MAGIK: Listening. Yes.WATTERS: Nurturing? Did I miss nurturing?MAGIK: Bringing nature. Going out into nature.WATTERS: Nature.MAGIK: It is really because nature --WATTERS: Take them into nature. Okay, listening --MAGIK: Counteracts.WATTERS: Listening to them, holding them, taking them on walks in the woods. Am I missing anything else?MAGIK: Yes, asking them what they need for support.WATTERS: Asking them for support.MAGIK: Asking them what they need for support.WATTERS: Okay. These are -- this is big advice.MAGIK: Yes, and I think being vulnerable --WATTERS: Oh, that's a deal killer.MAGIK: Yes, being vulnerable. I think men -- oh come on.WATTERS: I'm teasing.MAGIK: You got divorced Jesse, right? I'm sure you had a couple of nights where you were sad and where you felt lonely, you know? I think that everyone needs to feel comfortable to feel that.WATTERS: Yes. I am the most vulnerable man you'll ever meet, but we have to go.You're a good witch and we love you.Johnny is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: It's graduation season; but for some, graduation is canceled thanks to Arab Spring Break.So Johnny hit the streets to give graduates the advice they deserve.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, FOX NEWS ASSOCIATE PRODUCER: Graduation season is upon us.
