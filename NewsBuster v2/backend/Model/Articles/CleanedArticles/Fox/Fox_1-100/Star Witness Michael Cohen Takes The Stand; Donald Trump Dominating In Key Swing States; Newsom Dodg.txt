Plain and simple.WATTERS: Michael Cohen takes the stand.DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They've got no evidence and I'm innocent.Everything they touch turns to what?(Bleep).TRUMP: You shouldn't use that kind of language.WATTERS: Massive Trump rally in New Jersey makes the media crazy.JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I don't know whatever (bleep) you want to say.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are losing people through your cause because of this.WATTERS: Arab Spring Break at a boiling point.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are losing people who actually hate you.WATTERS: Jon Lovitz is here.JON LOVITZ, ACTOR: Good for you, Jack.WATTERS: Plus --JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Show me your best Kamala Harris impression.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Cackles)WATTERS: Day 16 of the Trump trial where no one will tell us the crime. Alvin Bragg's star witness, Michael Cohen finally took the stand today. The prosecution tried to paint Cohen as a respectable family man who became a lawyer to please his granny.But the packed courtroom rolled its eyes because everybody knows the real Cohen, a man who lied to that same granny to get ahead.Cohen has been disbarred from practicing law. He went to jail for perjury and tax evasion, lied to banks, he lied to Congress, lied to his wife. Cohen even secretly recorded conversations with Trump.When you talk to your lawyer and he secretly tapes your conversations and violates your attorney-client privilege, he is not your lawyer, he is a rat.Alvin Bragg's whole case rests on a lying rat.Cohen wants his client sent to jail for following his advice. The man will say anything to convict Trump and rehab his disgraced career because if Cohen's testimony doesn't stick, the CNN hits are over. No more book deals, no more Netflix pilots.Tomorrow, the defense will cross-examine Cohen and they'll have plenty of fodder.Today, Cohen told the court he paid Stormy Daniels by taking a loan out on his own home. Why didn't he just cut Stormy a check? He says he didn't want his wife to find out. Why would Cohen's wife care if Trump was paying to keep a porn star quiet? Was Cohen protecting Trump or himself?Then Cohen punched a hole through the prosecution's case, so big Bragg could fit through it. He testified he killed the same Stormy Daniels story when it was posted on a gossip website in 2011.Was Trump running for president in 2011? No. That would be Mitt Romney, which proves famous tycoons' catch and kill bad press because bad press is bad for business, and happy wife happy life.This was more personal than political. You protect your family and the brand, whether there's a campaign or not.And it was personal for Cohen, too. He testified that he was devastated when Trump didn't tap him to be chief-of-staff. Cohen says he knows he wasn't qualified, but it would have been nice just to be considered. He even thought he was being considered for attorney general.So when Trump told him he wasn't taking him to Washington, Cohen became suicidal and wanted revenge. That's when the Feds raided Cohen's office to try to get him to flip, to turn the fan boy into a hand grenade. That's what the Feds have done to Trump's inner circle from the jump, raid and flip, raid and flip.People do and say anything when facing hard time. Cohen's career in corporate America is done. Convicting Trump is his only road to more income, so he is angling to be a reality star.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COHEN: My name is Michael Cohen, and for years, I was the personal lawyer for a notoriously bad man.Since then, I've been on a journey of redemption, working to set things right.Now, I'm paying it forward, wielding the tools that I've learned for regular people in trouble.The little guy doesn't usually have access to people with my particular set of skills.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So if Trump is acquitted, no Netflix deal for Cohen. So Cohen can prattle on all day about the defendant, but the defendant is gagged. He can't defend himself or he goes to jail. Not fair.So Trump brought JD Vance to court. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH): Michael Cohen is the prosecution's star witness. This guy is a convicted felon, who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump.Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Fox caught up with Cohen on his way home today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Michael, you seemed a bit nervous on the stand today. Were you nervous? Is Trump lying? Did he sleep with Stormy Daniels? What comments do you have for Trump?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Alvin Bragg wants you to believe a convicted liar and a porn star who sees ghosts. That other star witness, Stormy Daniels has sex with men for money on camera. This is a woman who will do anything for money and I mean, anything.Her resume is all over the internet, if you don't believe me. No morals, no standards -- nothing. And she is so well-grounded, she claims she can talk to dead people.The woman testified that she woke up naked in bed and couldn't remember what happened, implying it was a #MeToo situation. But a few years back, that's not what she told Bill Maher.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL MAHER, HOST, "REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER": Why did you (bleep) Donald Trump?(LAUGHTER)STORMY DANIELS, ADULT FILM ACTRESS: I have no idea.(LAUGHTER)MAHER: Okay, but you say it's not a #MeToo case.DANIELS: It is not a #MeToo case. I mean, I wasn't assaulted. I wasn't attacked or raped or coerced or blackmailed.They tried to shove me in the #MeToo box to further their own agenda.MAHER: Right.DANIELS: And first of all, I didn't want any part of that because it's not the truth and I'm not a victim in that regard.MAHER: That's not what she's saying now. She's talking about, he was bigger and blocking the way. It is all the #MeToo buzzwords. She said there was a power -- imbalance of power for sure.My hands were shaking so hard. She said she blacked out. Blacked out? She's a porn star.A porn star is used to having sex with people she does not know. That's the job.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Bragg's witnesses, a prostitute and a lawyer, both professions that get paid by the hour and they'll do anything for money.This is a he said-she said without a crime. Trump legal team spokeswoman, Alina Habba, who is in that very same courtroom every single day said all the reporters care about is sex.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALINA HABBA, DONALD TRUMP ATTORNEY AND SPOKESPERSON: When anything salacious happens, all you hear is the clicking of, you know the keyboards. But when actual law and facts are discussed, it's silent.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The keyboard voyeurs forget the Lewinsky scandal backfired on Republicans. Clinton's approval ratings were in the 70s when he was impeached and they had a blue dress. This case doesn't have a dress, an eyewitness. They don't even have a document with Trump's John Hancock.Trump said it never happened, and Stormy said it did 20 years ago and no one said this was a crime until Trump started beating Biden. Even CNN knows it is rigged and costing the Democrats.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST, "FAREED ZAKARIA GPS": The trials against him keep him in the spotlight, infuriate his base who sees him as a martyr, and even may serve to make him the object of some sympathy among people in general, who believe that his prosecutors are politically motivated.This happens to be true in my opinion. I doubt the New York indictment would have been brought against a defendant whose name was not Donald Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Trump is in a win-win situation here. If he is found guilty, he appeals, the case is corrupt. He gets the Slick Milly bounce. If he's acquitted, he'd beat the corrupt system. He looks invincible, and he gets the I beat the case bounce.Our sources in Chappaqua just overheard Bill Clinton saying, "They never learn."Bill Hemmer is the co-anchor of "America's Newsroom." He was in the court today, and here he is. You may have been --BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Good evening, sir.WATTERS: -- in the courtroom of perhaps the biggest day yet of this trial. What did you learn?HEMMER; I would argue you're right about that, but tomorrow could be even bigger once we get into the cross-examination.Here's what I -- these are my impressions. I am not a lawyer., I am not trained in law, but here are my observations. The question and answer between Cohen and the prosecutor, it was almost like they were reading books to each other, almost as if he was anticipating the questions. That tells me that he was either well-prepared or well-rehearsed.There were very few objections from Trump's lawyers, maybe half a dozen. They were very quiet about it. There were no sidebars with the judge. So all that drama was missing from today.Here is what I found interesting. I was sitting about two rows behind Trump and I had Trump and Cohen on the angle, and I think we're Trump was sitting, based on that bench where the judge was, he had the option not even to look at Michael Cohen.Maybe he sees the top of his head from that angle, but he did not have to look at him eye to eye. Just got an interesting little setup. I don't know why they do it. I don't know if this is the way the courthouse is all throughout New York, but that was the way it was in this room today.Very drab by the way. You know, you're sitting there --WATTERS: You were expecting more.HEMMER: Well, I thought, yes, I say drab, maybe in a more simplistic way given the room and the circumstances, but I felt a feeling of intensity the entire time I was in there.I thought for Cohen, he was going back and forth with the lead prosecutor, a woman and they were just talking to each other for a couple hours. They took a break mid-afternoon, Jesse. And when Cohen came back, he was describing the period of time right before the inauguration, so this is early January.And he was telling the jobs that he was offered through Reince Priebus, and the reason why he did not like those jobs and the offerings that were coming his way. All of that, it was about an 11-minute span, Jesse. He looked directly at the jurors, and all of them, all 18 men and women, because you have six alternates were looking directly at him and that was the one time that I was able to observe that.WATTERS: So they seem very engaged. Was there a moment where he was like, a-ha, I have this document that said Trump knew this and this is how it went down and the whole court was like, oh, my goodness.HEMMER: He did mention the election several times, especially during the morning hours, saying that Trump was very concerned about women and getting their vote in the elections that were in the offering there, but when it comes to the evidence, in that courtroom there are monitors everywhere and the judge has a monitor, the witness has a monitor, all the jurors have monitors in front of them.You sitting in one of those pews, one of the benches you literally need to bring binoculars, which you're allowed to bring when the state puts an exhibit up on the monitor because the print is so small and they put up dozens and dozens of those exhibits today -- text messages, phone calls, other documents there today.WATTERS: And does it seem like the jury is dialed in on that that small data?HEMMER: For the most part, I would say yes.WATTERS: Okay.HEMMER: Here is what I did not notice in all of those exhibits. Not one of them mentioned the election and that's a problem for the prosecution.WATTERS: That is a problem. So I guess, it is the testimony of a convicted liar, tax cheat, and someone who is shopping a Netflix deal called "The Fixer."All right, Bill Hemmer who's going to freeze -- never again.HEMMER: Good to see you.WATTERS: It's going to be Laura Ingraham tomorrow, but a big day for you. Thanks for bringing that to our attention.HEMMER: You got it, Jesse.WATTERS: Former US attorney, Jay Town joins me now.Jay, tell me what you thought the significance of today was?JAY TOWN, FORMER US ATTORNEY: Well, you know, Mr. Fix-It is not fixing the troubles with DA Bragg's case at all.You're right in your lead-in that he has actually punched a hole so big in the case that even Bragg himself could fit through it, I'm going to steal that line, by the way.WATTERS: It's yours.TOWN: But you are dead on, Jesse. Yes, even if you were to believe, and you would have to suspend credulity in order to believe every single word that Michael Cohen has said, you still don't have proof beyond a reasonable doubt of any element of any charge defense against Donald Trump.Where is the false records entry? He can't testify about that at all. There's all this mention about Weisselberg, the CFO for the Trump Organization who is not a witness in this case, who won't testify, who can't -- and therefore, none of Cohen's testimony will be corroborated.And so what we're really seeing here is a build up to, I think, Todd Blanche's cross-examination tomorrow, and Todd is going to have a great night's sleep tonight because he knows that tomorrow and for a couple of days, the woodshedding that he is going to provide on national television on Michael Cohen is going to make him sort of the hero of defense counsel across the country.WATTERS: What does that look like to you, Jay, when he gets his hands wrapped around Cohen?TOWN: Well, you know, Todd's going to -- I mean, he has to go hard. You know, there's been prognosticators saying he should take it easy. He doesn't want to go too hard on this witness. Why?This is the state's entire case. The fulcrum of the case is Michael Cohen. And so all of his previous lies, all of the times that he has signed written declarations that Trump didn't have anything to do with the Stormy Daniels situation. You pointed out, I think, a fact that doesn't get enough air time, again, in your lead-in that he took out a line of credit on his own home so that he could pay the $130,000.00.Now that is not a man who is part of a conspiracy with a billionaire, and then a billion dollar company in David Pecker in AMI and the "National Enquirer" to kill stories for money to unlawfully impact an election. That's a man acting on his own. That's why he doesn't tell his wife.A hundred thirty grand to the Trump Organization, if they were going to pay it out of Accounts Payable, why not do it in 2016? Why wait till 2017? Because that's when they found out about it because Cohen was acting on his own.WATTERS: So you'd go hard there and start pointing, maybe try to get under Cohen's skin, call him a liar, prove he is a liar and say you said this. Didn't you mean this? Didn't you say this? And get him rattled.TOWN: Sure, and you said this yesterday, but didn't you two years ago say this? I would play the videos of him testifying before Congress or his other interviews where he is very compelling, and, you know, seemingly telling the truth about the former president, similar to the testimony today, right?If you believe what he had to say today, he was compelling to you. Well, he's lied under oath according to Cohen, and been just as compelling. This guy is a serial liar.So Todd Blanche is going to throw absolute haymakers. The state is going to rest this week, and I really believe that the defense deserves a directed verdict from Judge Merchan, but he is no profile and courage and this could -- you know, this would hurt the bottom line on his daughter's business anyway.WATTERS: Yes.TOWN: So I still expect us to get to a jury verdict.WATTERS: Now I want to go tomorrow. Is it too late to swap me in? That'd be something.TOWN: That's up to you and Bill. Yes.WATTERS: Yes, we will figure that one out.Thank you so much, Jay.TOWN: Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Donald Trump, the Jersey Shore and Johnny.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Joe Biden is doing a great job, isn't he?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The best ever. Yes, sleeping and mumbling and all that dumb stuff.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: After another week trapped in a freezing courtroom, Trump hit the beach and they say 100,000 of his supporters showed up to see him at a Jersey Shore rally. Are blue states in play?Last time, Biden beat Trump by 16 in Jersey. Now Biden only leads by five. I mean, Jersey is in play people.Lifelong Democrat and NFL Hall of Fame, linebacker L.T. says Trump Red Pilled him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAWRENCE TAYLOR, AMERICAN FOOTBALL LINEBACKER: I grew up a Democrat and I've always been a Democrat until I met this man right here.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)TAYLOR: I will tell you why. He will not have to worry but nobody in my family ever voting for a Democrat again.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: A "New York Times" poll has Trump beating Biden and five out of the six battlegrounds -- Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Trump flipped them because of young Black and Hispanic voters moving right or as Trump would say, diversity.At the Jersey Shore, Trump didn't beat around the bush. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If you come here from another country and try to bring jihadism or anti-Americanism or antisemitism to our campuses, we will immediately deport you.You look at the economy, the real economy, not the fake economy. Everything they touch --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Turns to (bleep).TRUMP: Turns to what?GROUP: (Bleep).TRUMP: You shouldn't use that kind of language.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Look. Look, you can't use the word (bleep). Okay?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Trump's like President George Carlin, speaks for the Average Joe and tells it like it is. Below Average Joe, President Biden performing so poorly the media is tearing up the playbook.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ZAKARIA: I have to admit, none of this is playing out as I thought it would. Trump is now leading in almost all the swing states, but behind those numbers lie even more troubling details, as someone worried about the prospects of a second Trump term, I think it's best to be honest about reality.CARVILLE; Trump's more ahead than he has ever been.Everything that we're throwing is spaghetti at a wall and none of it is sticking. What we are doing is really, really not working.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But some of the media are still stuck on stupid.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONNY DEUTSCH, MSNBC HOST: Anybody that votes Republican and doesn't understand you're voting for the end of democracy, just pay attention to the Sunday shows.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: No one is paying attention to the Sunday shows. This is this isn't 2004 anymore.Watch my propaganda. That's the strategy.Also, Nancy Pelosi called you bitter clingers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We've seen demagogues come down the pike, destroy the press. What is -- what is -- what do the Republicans say? Fake news.So they're diminishing that in the eyes of these poor souls who are looking for some answers. We've given them to them, but they're blocked by some of their views on guns -- they have the three G's -- guns, gays, God.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: They don't know you. They don't want to know you. They hate you.Watch the Sunday shows, you bitter clinger.North Dakota governor and former presidential candidate, Doug Burgum joins us now.All right, Governor, why do you believe Trump is surging?GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R-ND): Well, I did take a look at that Pelosi clip you just had where she calls poor souls, but when I'm standing there in New Jersey, looking at all these patriots who are there, what I'm seeing is the best of America.You know, people can slice and dice this as across demographic groups, but if you look at the theme of who is there, it's families, and it's people who work. People who work for a living and they were on the motorcade and they were lining the streets for miles before he even got to that venue, and they're all waving their American flags.You've got firehouses where you have the firemen who are standing on top of the truck waving flags. This is two miles before you get to the venue and these are people that work in America, the working class supports Donald Trump.And they're not the poor souls, they're the people that care about their communities, they care about their families, they care about the future of this country, and they can see through, you know, all of the stuff that's being pushed on them.WATTERS: They're not watching the Sunday shows, are they?BURGUM: No, they've never heard of them and they don't know who is on them and they don't care about that.WATTERS: So when you hear that type of propaganda. You know, you're not a Republican. You know, you're going to vote for a dictator. This is going to be the end of democracy. What does that tell you about the left's strategy?BURGUM: Well, it tells me that they don't understand America and they don't understand how America works. And this dictator hoax is -- the front row seat of any place in the nation as governor of North Dakota, because I'm 1,200 days into the Biden bureaucratic dictatorship, because virtually nothing has passed Congress and everything comes down from a three-letter agency.We're fighting over 30 different rule and mandate efforts that are coming in a barrage right now, that they're trying to get in before the Congressional Review Act date on May 20th and they basically have a one size fits all view of how we should run our small businesses, run our farms, run our energy business, you know, run the US grid.I mean, all of these ideas are not things that have come from Congress, and they're all based on a very liberal ideology. And we're -- so what do we -- I'm spending my job now suing the federal government is what I'm kind of doing for a living.WATTERS: You're just a lawyer who is playing a politician.Joe Biden, I mean, people talk about you on the ticket. Joe Biden has his ticket, it said it's Kamala, here is the ticket. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My name is Joe Biden, I work for Kamala Harris.(LAUGHTER)BIDEN: I asked her to be my vice president. I knew I needed somebody smarter than me.KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have to know that sometimes people will open the door for you and leave it open, sometimes they won't and then you need to kick that (bleep) door down.(LAUGHTER)HARRIS: Excuse my language. (Cackles).(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Okay, is she talking about if they are re-elected? She's just going to kick that door down to the Oval?BURGUM: Could be. I don't know. Maybe Joe is in there with all the ice cream and she came to --WATTERS: He loves two scoops. What do you make of these two?BURGUM: Well, I think that Vice President Harris has accomplished one thing, which is she's managed to be less popular than the least popular president in history.WATTERS: It's true. It's quite an accomplishment for Kamala, or Momala or whatever they call her.Doug Burgum, thank you so much.BURGUM: Thank you, Jesse.WATTERS: Gavin Newsom giving the homeless vodka shots. Right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Gavin Newsom has been promising to end homelessness for as long as he's been in politics, and he's a lifelong politician.As mayor of San Francisco, he has rolled out a Stalin-esque 10-year plan to get each resident a roof.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): Housing solves homelessness and if we're going to solve the problem of those that are out on the streets that we define as homeless, we better solve the housing problem if we're going to have an impact, and that's why we established this framework, what we call a 10- year plan to end chronic homelessness in San Francisco.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Bush was president when he said that. Bush.Gavin has been governor for five years. He spent $24 billion on the homeless, added 30,000 homeless, and can't tell us where the money went.Finally, he was confronted. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Is your administration doing enough to determine whether the money that's being plowed into homelessness is being well-spent?NEWSOM: One of the vaccine issues that was highlighted in the audit was local, and each city and county has different strategies and approaches. We've tried to level set that.REPORTER: I'm sorry, Governor, I didn't hear responses to either of those questions.Do you acknowledge whether the money -- that the state isn't doing enough to ensure that the money is being well spent?NEWSOM: The audit did not surprise me. This state has advanced unprecedented investments, you're correct and unprecedented interventions, demanding more accountability with state money at the local level.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Where did the $24 billion go? Don't look at me. I'm just the governor, but I knew we were going to lose it. That was his answer.But don't worry, they have a new plan. San Francisco is going to give the homeless shots of vodka. Here's the goal: Keep alcoholics drunk, but not too drunk. The city is running a managed alcohol program for homeless addicts for five million bucks a year.Basically a speakeasy that they're running out of an old hotel in the Tenderloin where it's happy hour all day. These guys get three hots and a cot. Nurses come around like cocktail waitresses with beer, wine, or liquor to "meet their addiction needs," but keeping someone at a safe level of intoxication.The program has room for 20 addicts and it wouldn't be a taxpayer slush fund without a little DEI. Half of the beds are strictly for "the Latinx and indigenous population."Nationally syndicated radio host, Dana Loesch joins me now.Dana, how come we didn't think of this? You just give the homeless vodka.DANA LOESCH, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO HOST: Yes, not just vodka. I mean, it's like a full on bar. I don't know if it's like top shelf or not. But apparently they have wine to choose from. They have a certain amount of brews.You also get some vodka. I don't know what other spirits are being offered, and it is limited to like two or whatever a day. And I mean, this is all taxpayer funded.Now, case in point. Remember, Jesse, Gavin Newsom has been bragging that California is the model for the nation for Democrats. On his watch, they went from $100 billion surplus because they were taking in over $50 million something in taxes for one year. Now, they're running something like a $46 billion deficit, half of which, according to this legislative analyst audit was spent on these homeless programs that they didn't even bother tracking.This, Jesse, is the only one that they actually tracked, probably because it has to do with their favorite meal, Democrats in California, liquor. So this is insane. That's the model for the nation. So everybody needs to pay attention to that because that's your option in November.WATTERS: I wonder if the Pelosi vineyard has the contract for the Hair of the Dog San Francisco Alcoholics Program?LOESCH: Right. I would wonder if she is down there surfing, but she's probably partaking secretly, maybe perhaps in the back. But that's -- I mean, that's what you get. There's no accountability, as you said.WATTERS: Unbelievable.All right, well, if we are ever out in that neck of the woods, we're definitely going to have a camera come visit the happy hour in the homeless shelter.LOESCH: Right.WATTERS: I've got to see where the taxpayer money is going.LOESCH: Unbelievable. Unbelievable.WATTERS: Or it's going down their throats, we know.Thank you so much, Dana.Johnny, at the Trump rally.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Donald Trump says he's willing to go to jail to save the Constitution. Are you okay with that?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When he becomes president in jail, he's going to put a suit on, pardon himself and walk out.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Pro-Hamas protesters are now identifying as traffic cones.

You are causing people to actually hate you.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: At the University of Washington, there is a standoff between Antifa Hamas and normal Americans. And at Columbia, one student ripped her diploma in half. Why? To free Palestine.And to Duke, students staged a walkout during the commencement speech by Jerry Seinfeld.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER: Jerry is also serving as our commencement speaker today.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)(BOOING)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Who organized these protests? Newman.Jerry is probably the cleanest, most apolitical comedian in America. Why do they hate him? Because his name is Seinfeld.Meanwhile, Rosie O'Donnell and her celebrity friends are done telling Joe Biden to abandon Israel. They're going straight to his boss, Dr. Jill.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jill Biden, we are calling on you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are mothers.CYNTHIA NIXON, ACTRESS: And daughters.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And grandmothers.ROSIE O'DONNELL, COMEDIAN: Sisters.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And advocates for peace and justice.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And simply human beings.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dr. Biden, we are calling on you today --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because we know you are all of those things as well.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And because of the immense power you hold as First Lady of the United States --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To implore you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Please, Dr. Biden.O'DONNELL: The world is watching.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're calling on you to stop the unfolding genocide in Palestine.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Actor and comedian, Jon Lovitz joins us now.All right, Lovitz, I know you're a big Disney guy. You're taking the family to Disneyworld. You've got the fast passes, you're all set. And then you're five hours late because pro Hamas protesters are sitting in the middle of the freeway. How do you handle it?LOVITZ: I would drive around them. There's always obstacles in life and that -- you said it, they disrupt the traffic. The Hamas disrupted the deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations. They disrupted Jerry Seinfeld's commencement speech. They just -- that's what they do, you know?And they go after certain things. It's to get press like which they're getting. And, you know, the whole thing is a lie. It is not a genocide, it's a war. And you go, who's organizing it? It's the Students for Justice for Palestine. They have 250 chapters on all the campuses and they're funded by AMP, which is the American Muslims for Palestine. And the AMP, they fund among other things, Hamas.So it's all connected.WATTERS: Queers for Palestine.LOVITZ: They want to take all the people in power, like they did in Dearborn, Michigan. That's what they want to do.WATTERS: Yes. I didn't think I'd see Queers for Palestine.LOVITZ: That's the most insane thing ever because if they went -- if those people into Gaza, they would, Hamas would kill them, literally. They push gay people off of buildings. This isn't a democracy, you know, and I understand it's bad that that people are getting -- innocent civilians in Palestine are getting killed in a war, but it's a war that Hamas started and they wanted a never ending war.Now they want a ceasefire. I guarantee you if Israel was losing, there'd be no ceasefire and you can't reason with these people. Hezbollah, years ago, they invaded Israel killed eight soldiers, kidnapped two, took them back as hostages. So Israel says, there's no acceptable losses.So they drop pamphlets on Lebanon saying to people, tomorrow at three o'clock, we're going to be bombing to get our hostages back, get out. And Hezbollah said, can you believe they're bombing Lebanon? And they go, well, you captured two of our soldiers and you killed eight of our soldiers. They go, oh, you're just using that as an excuse.You can't reason with that mentality. They also killed those two hostages, by the way.WATTERS: Yes.LOVITZ: And this is the same thing, exact thing, but on a bigger scale.WATTERS: Yes, most people when they wage war, don't drop, save the date notes on the enemy so the civilians can get out of the way.LOVITZ: Right.WATTERS: So Seinfeld is out there trying to tell these kids how to live a successful happy life and they left, Lovitz. They just walked out. They didn't even hear a single ounce of wisdom. And do you even think that they understand that no one is talking about Israel and Palestine? We're talking about how stupid they look.LOVITZ: I think they have no idea and what did they achieve by walking out? They ruined their own graduation and 20 years from now, they are going to look back and say, I ruined my own graduation.I mean, I think people have a right to protest. But just go get a permit. You give them a place to protest. They don't have a right to block traffic. They don't have a right to ruin other things. I don't think so.But they do have a right to get a permit and protest. That's America. You're not going to agree with everybody. Give them -- get a permit and give them a space to do it that's not interfering with everything else.And then if they want to try and get press for it, and you know, try to get press, but that's what this is about. And, you know, Israel is fighting terrorists, the same as the United States fought the terrorists that brought down you know, the World Trade Center on 9/11. It's the same thing.WATTERS: It is.LOVITZ: Israel is our ally. Israel is a democracy. Queers for Palestine would be murdered in Gaza and the Palestinians have five chances at the same time Israel was created to have their own state and they turned it down every time because they don't want a two-state solution. They want Israel. They weren't the land of Israel.And they're not even really Palestinians, they're Jordanian refugees and Yasser Arafat changed it to calling them Palestinians in 1964. But they've had five deals, and they are people and they deserve a decent life and everything. And Israel pulled all the Jews out of Gaza and gave them Gaza.So, there is no occupation. There is no genocide. Israel paid for the land. They didn't take it and on and on.Everything is a lie.WATTERS: It's crazy. No, it is crazy. You should have been a commencement speaker. People could have learned a lot, and if they wanted --LOVITZ: Well, Jerry -- Jerry is a great guy. I've known him for years. You know, he's the guy that you know, he does the most innocuous humor about like lint in your belly button. Where does it come from? I want to know, and that's who they're protesting.Because he went to Israel. Yes, because he's Jewish like me. He's the same age and Jews of our generation of Israel goes, we go. And in the United States, we have nowhere to go.WATTERS: All right, I like your shirt, Lovitz. What's on that by the way?LOVITZ: Ice cream cones.WATTERS: Delicious.
