Golf's biggest star under arrest.POLICE OFFICER: He's going to jail and there ain't nothing you can do about it.WATTERS: Plus --("HALF BAKED" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)SIR SMOKE-A-LOT, THURGOOD JENKINS, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: Four years just for weed. Damn.WATTERS: As long as America has been a country, politicians had been fighting. In 1798, the House of Representatives held the hearing to impeach Tennessee Senator William Blount, the crime, treason.When proceedings started to get testy, Federalist Roger Griswold called his fellow Congressman Matthew Lyon a scoundrel. Today's equivalent of the F- word. Lyon hawked a loogie right in his face. Griswold came back swinging with a wooden walking stick while Lyon and fended him off with tongs, hot from the fireplace.Fifty years later, a squabble over slavery on the Senate floor, led to abolitionist Charles Sumner being caned by pro-slavery Representative Preston Brooks. Congress used to be the house of scuffles.But in 1967, the House decided to clean up its act, writing a code of conduct for Congress, its tenants: Professionalism, ethics and model behavior. How's that going right now?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COMER: I'll give you your time back. We need to stop the clock. You all continued -- you look like a Smurf here.SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK): We can be two consenting adults, we can finish it here.SEAN O'BRIEN, PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS: Okay, that's fine. Perfect.MULLIN: You want to do it now?O'BRIEN: I'd love to do it right now.MULLIN: Well, stand your butt up then.O'BRIEN: You stand up your butt.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Oh, hold on. Oh, stop it. Is that your solution to every problem. No, no, sit down.Look at you. You know, your United States senator.COMER: We'll let the record show that Mr. Raskins could not answer the question.REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): First of all --COMER: What did the Bidens do to receive the money?RASKIN: Let me start with this. My last name is Raskin. Okay? We've sat next to each other for more than a year. You don't have to add the S.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And things went completely off the rails last night during a House Oversight hearing. The committee was debating whether to hold AG Merrick Garland in contempt for refusing to turn over tapes of Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. The hearing was supposed to start at 11, but a group of Republicans flew to New York City to support Trump in court. The hearing ended up happening at eight.Sources tell PRIMETIME the Democrats were bent out of shape for getting their schedules pushed back and we're a little hangry. We all know how we get when we haven't eaten.That's when it turned into the Real Housewives of Capitol Hill. Democrat Jasmine Crockett and Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene went wild.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CROCKETT: Do you know what we're here for? You know we're here --GREENE: I don't think you know what you're here for.CROCKETT: Well, you're the one talking about --GREENE: I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading.CROCKETT: No, ain't nothing.COMER: Hold on. Hold on. (Gavel). Order.REP. STEPHEN LYNCH (D-MA): Mr. Chairman --REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): That's beneath even you, Miss Greene.OCASIO-CORTEZ: I do have a point of order, and I would like to move to to take down Miss Greene's words.That is absolutely unacceptable. How dare you attack the physical appearance of another person.COMER: The meeting will suspend. The meeting will suspend.GREENE: Are your feelings hurt?OCASIO-CORTEZ: Move her words down.GREENE: Aww.OCASIO-CORTEZ: Oh, oh girl, baby girl.GREENE: Oh really?OCASIO-CORTEZ: Don't even play.GREENE: Baby girl? I don't think so --OCASIO-CORTEZ: We are going to --(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: It's against decorum do insult another member's physical appearance, but it didn't stop there.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CROCKETT: I'm just curious, just to better understand your ruling. If someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody's bleached blonde, bad built, butch body that would not be engaging in personalities, correct?COMER: A what now?REP. ANNA PAULINA LUNA (R-FL): Chairman, I make -- I make a motion to strike those words.COMER: I don't get it.CROCKETT: I trying to get clarification.LUNA: Look it. Calm down. Calm down.CROCKETT: No, no, no, because this is what y'all do. So I'm trying to get clarification.LUNA: I would like to get through proceeding.CROCKETT: So, I am trying to --COMER: Miss Crockett, you're not recognized. Miss Crockett --LUNA: I can't hear you with your yelling. Calm down.CROCKETT: If you don't want me to be --LUNA: Can you please calm down.CROCKETT: No, don't tell me to calm down.LUNA: Calm down.CROCKETT: Because y'all talk noise and then you can't take --LUNA: You're out-of-control.CROCKETT: Because if I comment on (bleep) about her, y'all are going to have a problem.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Then Democrat Jamie Raskin accused other members on the committee of drinking.Our source says there was a solo cup, but couldn't confirm what was in it.Things are so bad. John Fetterman of all people says he's embarrassed, writing: "In the past I've described the US House as 'The Jerry Springer Show.' Today, I'm apologizing to 'The Jerry Springer Show.'"But the squad has no regrets. AOC writes back to Fetterman: "I understand you likely would have not stood up for your colleague and seem to be confused about racism and misogyny being a both sides issue. But I stand up to bullies instead of becoming one."Binder says President Biden is disappointed in Congress and expects them to show a little more dignity.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This is something the president would agree upon, which is you know, you -- as someone who was a senator for 36 years, he believes that people should respect each other, treat each other with dignity and civility.You have to treat people with dignity. You have to treat people with respect. It is important. It doesn't matter which side of the aisle you sit on. It is important to do that because you are there to work on behalf of the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: We all want decorum, but Biden calls Republicans Nazis. He says they want to put Blacks back in chains.His son is a trainwreck and there's drugs in his White House. Even Biden's dogs are biting everybody in sight and he won't even apologize.There is no manners in Washington. The Democrats are putting Republicans in prison and they're upset about an eyelash crack? How many Trump associates have had their doors kicked down by Feds and raided? Did the Feds politely knock on the door before ransacking Mar-a-Lago and rifling through Melania's underwear drawer?What are we talking about dignity and civility? Biden called Texans Neanderthals. Democrats are letting men strip naked in women's locker rooms. How is that dignifying?Their whole campaign is that Trump will literally murder you if he is re- elected, mass murder. Maxine Waters, no relation, said get in their face. "The View" even agrees with Eric Holder, when they go low, you kick them.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Marjorie Taylor Greene who is just unfit for office. She is unfit.She lacks the decorum.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": If one -- if one goes scorched Earth to the floor and the other meets them there, our politics is just going to descend.HOSTIN: I think you --GRIFFIN: You don't need to -- there's a -- you could see it in Jamie Raskin's face. He didn't like it.HOSTIN: Going high doesn't work anymore. If you go low with me --GRIFFIN: But that's all we're going to get.HOSTIN: -- I am going to go to the Earth's crust. I am going to become small like an ant. I'm going to meet you were you are.You've got to go low, Alyssa.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Republicans are always so dignified and civil, aren't they? Where's that gotten them? Should they take a page from the Democrats? Act holier than thou and then get their hands dirty in the dark? It looks like they are.Sources tell PRIMETIME that Republicans will be voting on holding Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for withholding Biden's dementia tapes.How do they know Biden didn't just doctor the transcripts? They need to be sure. And as a co-equal branch of government, they have every right to access them. Biden was forgetting when he was vice president. How do we know it wasn't any worse?The White House doctors transcripts all the time. This isn't regular contempt. It's inherent contempt. Because they know the Justice Department won't lock up Garland. Inherent contempt hasn't been used in over a hundred years. It would authorize Mike Johnson, House Speaker, to order the sergeant-of-arms to arrest Merrick Garland.If they're going to lock up Republicans, maybe they need a taste of their own medicine.Let's bring in Fox News contributor, Charlie Hurt.Charlie, aren't you just so saddened by the eyelash comment? I mean, it's not like anybody's arresting the Republican nominee for president or anything?CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I am strongly in favor of striking those words as if that makes any difference whatsoever. But I love that AOC is -- that's her call to arms is to strike the words.You know, Winston Churchill famously said that the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with an average voter, which I've always thought was kind of harsh because I find that's like my -- the highest I feel about democracy is when I talk to average voters.For us in America today, the best argument against democracy is listening to an actual House hearing in the House of Representatives.To be fair though, Marjorie Taylor Greene and you have alluded to all of this, Marjorie Taylor Greene asked a very good question. She started this with a very good question, asking whether or not -- and the whole thing is about whether or not to hold Merrick Garland in contempt of court -- in contempt of Congress for using the Justice Department to jail his enemy, which is obviously patently true.And what she asked was, is any Democrat on the committee, currently employing the daughter of the judge who is running the circus to jail Trump in New York? That's a very good question. And I think it's so interesting that that's the question that caused all of these people to lose their minds, and we never got the answer to the question.We should go one by one, force every single one of them to answer that question. What are they hiding? It sounds like maybe, I mean, just as a reporter, I look at this, and I'm like, okay, maybe somebody is -- maybe they're a whole lot -- maybe this lady is on a whole lot more people's payroll than they want us to know about.WATTERS: So she might have been over the target, you're saying, because we're hearing Goldman -- Representative Goldman, Democrat in New York might be involved in the Judge Merchan or the daughter situation. Maybe there are other people on the committee. Is that what you're alluding to?HURT: Yes, and Democrats are always very good, because they have the media to work with them. They're always very good at distracting -- playing distraction games. And to me, this whole thing was a giant distraction.And, of course, your central point, the most important point of what you just said, is the most important thing and that is, we are now in a system where you have the executive branch trying to put their political enemies in jail.In fact, they are putting their political enemies in jail. We've never seen anything like this. And so the idea that Congress -- Republicans in Congress would use their authority, there is a jail cell in the House of Representatives in the basement of the House of Representatives -- the idea that Republicans would use that jail cell to put Merrick Garland or anybody else who is in contempt of Congress is, you know, at this point, it's fair game.I don't want to see us go in that direction, but I don't want to see us in the direction we're in now, where you have the Department of Justice completely corrupted and being used to go after the political enemies of the of the people that are in the White House.This is terrifying, this is not the way to run a democracy.WATTERS: Incarcerated Steve Bannon for defying Congress. So you can't have the attorney general --HURT: Peter Navarro is still in jail.WATTERS: Right, and the Justice Department do nothing about that. So you empower the Speaker Johnson to order the House sergeant-of-arms to go arrest the attorney general.Do you think Mike Johnson has what it takes to do that?HURT: Well, the real problem is you've got to get Merrick Garland to actually come into the Capitol in order to get him and my thinking is that, if you think that's going to happen, he is going to --WATTERS: Oh, that's how that works.HURT: Yes, exactly. He's going to avoid coming to the Capitol at any cost. But this is why Jesse, you know, we don't even want to play these games. And the idea that the Biden administration --WATTERS: No.HURT: -- is doing something that no previous administration has ever done, which is to use the Department of Justice to jail their political enemies, it is nuts and it never ends.WATTERS: Right. We don't want to have to play these games, but they're forcing the Republicans hand and that's the point.HURT: Precisely.WATTERS: Charlie Hurt, the most civilized and dignified guest we have on JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME. Never violates decorum on anything whatsoever.HURT: And I'm just so glad to hear you're not related to Maxine.WATTERS: No relation. Thanks, Charlie.Shocking video of Diddy just leaked. Straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Fox News Alert: CNN got its hands on surveillance footage that shows Diddy physically assaulting his girlfriend.Warning: This is graphic.Senior national correspondent, Kevin Corke has the details -- Kev.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Just sickening video. I'm sorry I have to show this to you, but I think people will learn a lot about what's happening in this story, Jesse.This is from March 2016. It is surveillance video obtained exclusively by CNN and it shows Sean "Diddy" Combs grabbing, shoving, dragging, and kicking his then girlfriend, Cassie Ventura during an altercation that frankly matches allegations in a now settled federal lawsuit filed back in November by Miss Ventura.The footage shows the music mogul holding a towel around his waist as he runs down the hall after his then girlfriend. He then grabs her by the back of the neck, throws her to the floor, still holding that towel. He then with one hand appears to turn around and kick her while she's still on the floor. And then he tries to drag her down the hallway, barbaric.Now this incident occurred at the now closed Intercontinental Hotel in Central City, Los Angeles, and it appears to mirror a civil complaint lodged by Ventura back in November, which stated in part: He followed her into the hallway of the hotel while yelling at her, he grabbed at her. He then took a glass vase or glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her, causing glass to crash around them as she ran to the elevator to escape. Despicable.Now, you'll probably recall this as well, Jesse, Diddy posted this on X in December calling the allegations "sickening." Certainly the video appears to show he is lying about that.Meanwhile, in a statement, Miss Ventura's attorney says: "The gut wrenching video has only further confirmed the disturbing and predatory behavior of Mr. Combs. Words cannot express the courage and fortitude that Miss Ventura has shown in coming forward to bring this to light." Amen.Diddy for his part remains under investigation in a wide-ranging probe that sources suggest involves possible drug and sex trafficking crimes and perhaps even more. No comment from the mogul by himself tonight.And I want to share this as well, this within the past couple of hours, Jesse.Diddy's alleged drug mule, Brendan Paul, apparently will avoid jail time. He has accepted a plea deal, that according to "People" Magazine, he had been charged with felony cocaine possession just last month.I don't mind saying this. I'm sure you feel the same. Disgusting. That's all I can think of when I see what happened in that video.WATTERS: Everyone agrees with that, Kev. Thanks so much.CORKE: You bet.WATTERS: Let's turn it over now to Jaco Booyens, anti-human trafficking advocate and founder of Jaco Ministries.So why is this surveillance tape coming out now?JACO BOOYENS, ANTI-HUMAN TRAFFICKING ADVOCATE: Jesse, you're going to see a lot of this coming out like the drug mule saying I'll take a plea deal. I myself recently spoke to some of Diddy's associates in other businesses and they're willing to talk. They do not want to be implicated. They want to be quasi on the right side of this thing.This video actually briefly surfaced in 2016 when the case came up, and it was quickly suppressed. I'm glad it's back. Not surprised that it's back, you're going to see a lot of footage and evidence come to light because people don't want to go down with Diddy.WATTERS: When you say people don't want to go down with Diddy, we've reported before about Universal Records, Motown Records sponsoring some of these parties where a lot of this debauchery and criminal activity was allegedly happening.Are you saying that there's going to be pressure from many people in the music industry to make sure Diddy goes down so they don't?BOOYENS: Yes, if I can flash us back to Harvey Weinstein and the notion that the only casting couch that have controversy with Harvey Weinstein's casting couch is a joke.Many in Hollywood knew, many have done the same, and they offered Harvey up. I'm telling you that I've had personal conversations in the industry and they're very nervous. Many were at the parties, many do not want to be subpoenaed, as they should be, and ask what did you see? Did you see minors? Did you not?They're willing to talk, they're willing to offer things up. There's a buzz in the entertainment business at this moment about who's going to get a call and none of them want to.WATTERS: Oh, my God. So this might not be the only disgusting piece that we see about Diddy. And remember, he still has not been charged by the Feds. It's been over a month since the raid.BOOYENS: That is correct. And yes, Jesse, there is a lot more.I mean, I have on firsthand account, how Diddy would try to bribe individuals to stay quiet by very, very expensive gifts. And so remember, things happen in the recording studio and at these parties. And what should happen here, as should have happened with the Jeffrey Epstein situation, all involved, subpoena them, call them in front of counsel, examine them.If you're exonerated, you're exonerated. But if you were there, we need to make sure what you saw and what you didn't see. Did you know and you stayed silent? Did he bribe you? Was there extortion?Remember, him kicking a girlfriend which is despicable forced fraud and coercion goes with exploitation. It's par for the course, Jesse. There's a lot of this stuff that's going to come out.WATTERS: All right, well, we'll keep everybody posted as it develops.Jaco, thank you so much.BOOYENS: Thank you.WATTERS: A major update in the Paul Pelosi case, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Biden's Black exodus continues. Every day, we tick closer to the election, Biden bleeds more Black voters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel like the Black community don't really like Biden because like, when I go on the streets, it is when I am talking to my homies (bleep). There will be no (bleep) Biden, like, you know what I am saying?They say, Biden really doing nothing. They really -- they really like Trump. I don't know. They do like him.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He wants to make it seem as if he's for the Blacks and he's not really because he hasn't really helped anybody.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are trying to arrest Donald Trump, but they don't really have anything on him.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump has helped out a lot of people in the community, he helped out a lot of Black businesses, and I am voting for Trump.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The thing is he made sure Black people was good. African American people are good.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I mean, honestly, I like Trump.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I like Trump.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm probably the only Black person to admit it, but I want Trump back. I am sorry.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Black Americans have kept the Democratic Party competitive since the Civil Rights era. Biden can't win without them.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Look at this number for Donald Trump, 22 percent. Where was Donald Trump at this point four years ago in the polls? He was just at nine percent of the vote. So he's seen more than a doubling in his support among African Americans.My goodness gracious, if this held through the general election, obviously, we're still months away, this would be by far the best performance for a Republican candidate among Black voters in a generation, two generations, probably since 1960.This could be a truly historic march and it's quite a troubling sign for the Biden campaign.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: This is in line with our new Fox poll. We have Trump at 23 percent with Black voters. Biden's team sees the same numbers, they've been putting him and Kamala on Black radio and TV shows all week.Today, Biden went to an NAACP event and told the Black crowd, Trump is killing DEI.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My predecessor and his extreme MAGA friends are now going after diversity, equity and inclusion all across America.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That's your pitch? You'll save DEI?Biden's also delivering the commencement at a Black college this weekend, Morehouse, Atlanta. The students don't want him there and they're ready to protest. Today, the college's president said if you heckle Joe, no one gets a diploma.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID A. THOMAS, PRESIDENT, MOREHOUSE COLLEGE: What we won't allow is disruptive behavior that prevents the ceremony or services from proceeding in a manner that those in attendance can partake and enjoy.So for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he is speaking.I will cease the ceremonies on the spot if we were to reach that position.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden getting heckled at an all-Black college would be like Trump getting heckled at an Alabama football game. It just shouldn't happen. But don't worry, Joe has got tricks up his sleeve.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Today my administration took a major step to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule 1 drug to a Schedule 3 drug.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden is losing voters so he makes cannabis legal? Cannabis shouldn't be in the same drug class as heroin, I get it, but he's doing it for all the wrong reasons.Biden was anti-marijuana legalization when he was campaigning in 2019, but many on X found that he changed his mind in under a week. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN (NOVEMBER 19, 2019): The truth of the matter is, there's not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug.JIMMY KIMMEL, "JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE" HOST (NOVEMBER 18, 2019): Joe Biden is doing everything he can remind us that he is a very old person.(LAUGHTER)KIMMEL: Joe Biden says that if elected, he will not legalize marijuana federally because he thinks it might be a gateway drug.That's correct. It is a gateway drug to not getting the Democratic nomination for president.(LAUGHTER)BIDEN (NOVEMBER 20, 2019): I think we should decriminalize marijuana. Period. And I think everyone -- anyone who has a record should be let out of jail. Their records expunged.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden has got no convictions. He just goes where the wind blows. He says whatever he thinks will help him win. But voters see right through it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People come to our communities and pander for our votes and we know we've never seen this person before, ever. We know it is fake.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They just want to get the votes and that's it. They don't care about nothing else.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you really want the Black vote, spend more time in the Black community with Black people hearing about their problems.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Vivek Ramaswamy is a former 2024 presidential candidate.Vivek, I will save DEI and I will give you cannabis. Is that going to work?VIVEK RAMASWAMY (R), FORMER 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's one Hail Mary after another, Jesse.First, he wasn't going to debate; now, he's going to debate. First, he wanted an open border; now, he favors closing the border, kind of; first, it was he's against -- he is for criminalizing marijuana, then decriminalizing it. People aren't buying it.And here's why Trump is winning with Black voters. Black voters want some of the same things that every voter wants, which is honesty. Remember, Joe Biden is the guy who had the gall to say condescendingly that if you don't vote for me, you ain't Black.Well, you know what? People have eyes. Black people and all voters alike understand what four years under Donald Trump was like versus four years under Joe Biden. They respect that honesty and I think that's why we're seeing these unprecedented numbers from minority communities across the board going for Donald Trump and I think that could be a landslide ahead this year, if we seize on it.WATTERS: Yes, they respect the honesty and they're just getting shellacked economically. Donald Trump, Vivek, just announcing right now, he is going to hold on Thursday evening, a big event in the South Bronx. What does that tell you?RAMASWAMY: It tells me that actually Republicans are finally showing up in places that we should have been for a long time. The last time a Republican for president went to the South Bronx was actually Ronald Reagan in 1980 and that made a big difference then.I think we can have a 1980-1984 style Reagan outcome this year. And I think it's fantastic that President Trump is going to the South Bronx, not putting on theatrics, like Joe Biden is doing trying to check boxes, but authentically actually speaking to voters.America First includes all Americans. I'm talking to you tonight from Chicago. During my own campaign, I visited the south side of Chicago, Jesse, and there were more voters there who agreed with me on topics ranging from cutting off foreign aid that doesn't advance US interests in places like Ukraine, all the way to sealing our own southern border.So I think these historical lines that the media has drawn, that the Democratic Party has drawn, trying to pit Black against White or man against woman or gay against straight or even Democrat against Republican, those are false boundaries.When you have an America First movement now, that is, I dare say reuniting this country, and that's what Donald Trump is going to deliver.WATTERS: That's invigorating to hear you say that about the south side. Maybe Vivek, you can join Trump and the boogie down next Thursday. Maybe as surprise guest --RAMASWAMY: We've got to do more of it.WATTERS: Have a great weekend. Absolutely. I agree. Get in there and fight for it.RAMASWAMY: Thank you. Yes.WATTERS: Fox News Alert: David DePape, the man who broke into Nancy Pelosi's home and brutally assaulted her husband, Paul, was sentenced to 30 years in prison.The 2022 assault was all caught on camera where you can see Paul in a robe trying to simmer down DePape before the intruder just bludgeons him with a hammer.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)DAVID DEPAPE, SUSPECT: Hey, guys.OFFICER: Hi, how are you doing?DEPAPE: How are you?OFFICER: What's going on, man?DEPAPE: Everything's good.OFFICER: All right, drop the hammer.DEPAPE: Nope.PAUL PELOSI, NANCY PELOSI'S HUSBAND: Hey, hey, hey.OFFICER: What is going on right now?Oh, (bleep).(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: DePape was convicted of attempted kidnapping of a federal officer or employee and assault on an immediate family member of a federal official.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today's sentence reflects David DePape's lack of remorse and contrition for violently assaulting, Mr. Pelosi. The court's sentence will ensure that DePape will not be able to use violence to pollute the political process.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The world's number one golfer arrested this morning. New details right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: The gentleman's game has had its history of bad boys, sex scandals, gambling, cocaine.This weekend, it's the PGA Championship and up until this morning, the most exciting thing was John Daly ripping two packs of cigs, four Snickers, and two Cokes during a round at Valhalla. That was until the world's number one golfer got behind the wheel and ended up in handcuffs.It wasn't even the crack of dawn when a bus struck and killed a pedestrian right outside of the course. With traffic backed up, Scottie Scheffler driving himself in a player's only car was headed in early to play the second round.He tried to drive around the scene. Police ordered him to stop. There was some confusion and Scottie hit the gas. An ESPN reporter caught the whole scene. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ESPN REPORTER: A police officer in a yellow jacket like those ones are seeing their approached Scheffler's car, told him to stop. Scheffler continued to drive his vehicle at which point the officer attached himself to Scheffler's car.The officer then ripped the door open, pulled Scheffler out by the arm, pushed him up against the vehicle, placed him in handcuffs.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The world's top golfer was then dragged away in cuffs.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Guys, guys, guys.OFFICER: Dude, stay back.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm back. I'm back.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The biggest name in golf facing four charges, felony second degree assault on a police officer, and third degree criminal mischief, reckless driving, and disregarding signals from officers.Police in Louisville wasting no time releasing the mugshot either. After being booked the world's number one put out a statement calling it a misunderstanding: "I never intended to disregard any of the instructions. I'm hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today."And after ripping off the orange jumpsuit, Scheffler made it back to the course AND birdied the first hole.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not getting ahead of himself. And so, I think Andy's right. I think he might play some really great golf today getting lost in that.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: After a morning probably unlike anything he's ever had in his entire life. He starts off his round with a birdie.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: After getting arrested in the morning, Scottie was five under for the rounds and nine under for the tournament. He just won the Masters for the second time and is going into the weekend, two shots off the lead in the PGA Championship, and now he's facing a felony.Here he is after the round.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SCHEFFLER: I can't really explain what happened this morning. I did spend some time stretching in a jail cell, that was a first for me. You know, it was part of my warmup. I was just sitting there waiting. And you know, I started going through my warmup I felt like there was a chance I may be able to still come out here and play.And so, I started going through my routine. I tried to get my heart rate down as much as I could today. But like I said, you know, I still feel like my head is spinning a little bit.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The arrests divided the country. Was the cop overzealous grabbing onto the car? Or is this just the guy trying to get to work?Let's talk to Mark Lye, former pro golfer.Mark, where do you come down on this one?MARK LYE, FORMER PRO GOLFER: You know something, this guy, Scottie Scheffler is probably the most saintly guy that is out on the PGA Tour except for Zach Johnson these days. I mean, he credits his great play to God.I mean, this guy is -- he just had the birth of his first child last week. He's on top of the golfing world. He is not the guy that you would picture doing this kind of thing. There had to be some sort of misunderstanding.I think it's a huge hose job for this guy. You know, look, he's been on top of the game for 50 to 60 weeks. He's the number one player. He's got enough on his mind.And, you know, I've played in a lot of golf tournaments in my life, probably 28 Majors, and another 500 regular tour events. Nothing like this has ever happened.But I think everything was kind of ramped up, Jesse, when there was a death less than an hour ahead of that on the same road. So I think everyone just kind of went from DEFCON 3 to DEFCON 2. And the police force was I believe overzealous because Scottie Scheffler is not the guy that should have been involved in this kind of scuffle.WATTERS: All right, they were probably worked up over the fatality, maybe trying to protect the crime scene, just didn't realize it was Scottie in the vehicle, maybe got their signals crossed.Well, I think everybody's going to be following him this weekend and dialed in to the PGA Championship.LYE: Yes, they certainly should be. I can't imagine him --WATTERS: Maybe it will give good luck --LYE: Yes, I can't imagine him being able to play today, in fact, turning in one of the better rounds out there. He had to be just electrified over this whole situation.WATTERS: Mark, he was just stretching in the cell. That's why he played so well. You've got to stay limber at all times.LYE: Yes, that's right. At the top of the world one day, and at the bottom the next.WATTERS: All right. Well, we'll be watching him this weekend. That's right. All right, have a good one. Thanks, Mark.Sink or Swim.
