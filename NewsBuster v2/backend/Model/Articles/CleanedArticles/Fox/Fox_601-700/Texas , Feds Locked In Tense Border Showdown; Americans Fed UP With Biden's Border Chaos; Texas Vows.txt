LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Okay, that's another Daredevil move. This one lifted a couple of those from the stores.Hey Trax, great to see you. I'm going to find you in the city, too. I want to see that.MAKSUD AGADJANI, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, TRAXNYC: Thank you so much.INGRAHAM: I want to see that gold brick move and see what people think it's worth.I want to bring it over to Jesse's studio, see what he thinks. He takes it from here.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]WATTERS: Biden, Abbott, the Mexicans -- who blinks first?[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Take Me To Church, I go to work. I've got my --WATTERS: The Trump-Georgia prosecution goes off the rails.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do I got to do everything?[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Can we just ask to keep an open mind, be respectful and let us be weird animal people in our way.WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday, America.Plus, Michelle Obama for president.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle, I know it was hard being in the office for eight years, but save us.WATTERS: Nearly 250 years ago, our Founding Fathers debated the future of the government. The Federalists wanted a strong centralized federal government. Anti-federalists such as Thomas Jefferson believed that government power should be derived from the individual states joining together, and debates between the two school of thoughts flourished in townhalls and village squares, the topic was so contentious that oftentimes swords and bayonets were drawn.But ultimately, the founding fathers found the compromise. Some powers were assigned to the federal government like regulating trade. Other powers were assigned to the state governments like education, and other powers were shared, like the power to tax.The federal government has the power to wage war, and under Article IV Section 4 of the Constitution: The United States shall protect each state against invasion. But what if the federal government fails to protect the states against invasion? Well, the Constitution says the states can protect themselves from invasion when they're actually invaded or face an imminent threat.And the Supreme Courts agreed in several cases, reaffirming the rights of states to use military force in its own defense. You judge with your own eyes if the United States is being invaded.Foreign nationals are breaching our shores by boat and then sprinting through the beaches and just disappearing onto the streets. I mean, these foreigners have no right to break into our country. That's not immigration. What you're seeing on the screen is what every country in the world calls an invasion.They say it's not violent, but drugs, sex, and human smuggling and all of the crime and devastation associated with that is violent. That's what violence is.So why is Biden treating the border like a turnstile for the third world?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Where you are going?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: San Diego.REPORTER: San Diego. You?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: San Diego.REPORTER: Where are you going?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: New York.REPORTER: Thank you. You?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From Senegal.REPORTER: Where are you going?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: New York.REPORTER: Where you are you going?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senegal.REPORTER: Where are you from? Where are you going?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: New York.REPORTER: You?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senegal. New York.REPORTER: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senegal. New York.REPORTER: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senegal. New York.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Senegal. New York.REPORTER: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senegal. New York.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: All right, so what do you want as president? A travel agent or a builder? Because look where Biden stopped building the border wall.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: I am here in Jacumba, California. This is the United States. Over here on the other side is Mexico. I'm going to show you how easy it is to sneak across the border.All right now I'm in the United States and --(REPORTER speaking in foreign language.)TRANSLATION: Now, I'm in Mexico.REPORTER: It's that easy to cross the border and people are just walking through just like this.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now the majority of the country believes we're being invaded. Fifty-one counties in Texas agree. The state officially declared an invasion on the southern border. Greg Abbott is invoking Texas' constitutional authority to self-defense.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): And the authors of the Constitution knew there will be times when the federal government would not live up to its duty, and so they have empowered states in Article I Section 10, the right of self-defense.The Biden administration has really, truly abdicated its responsibility to secure the border and enforce the laws.Texas has a right as a state to stop criminals from coming into our state, to make arrests of those criminals.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The Texas National Guard is erecting more razor fencing. The Supreme Court had ruled the federal government had the right to cut the fence, but allowed Texas to reserve the right to throw it back up, and the governor is enlisting an army of farmers and ranchers to lay razor wire along the border, and 25 other states are backing Abbott, sending resources to Texas and echoing the state's right to self-defense.But razor wire won't be enough. Texas Rangers aren't just fence builders. They need to repel, arrest, detain, and deport what they've declared an invasion.But Democrats are now urging Joe Biden to federalize the Texas National Guard, rip the power away from Abbott and make them stand down and let the invasion, as it has been declared continue.Federalizing a state's National Guard has only been used in the most extreme circumstances. It was first used during the Whiskey Rebellion in 1792. It was also used during the Civil War, during desegregation and during urban riots, but this time is different.The Democrats would be federalizing the state's National Guard to not protect our citizens.What does the White House say about that?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The Border Patrol agents are now, as you said, allowed to cut through the wire because of what the Supreme Court has laid out.It's unfortunate that we had to go there. It's unfortunate that there is a governor in Texas, Governor Abbott, who has politicized this issue of what's happening on the border and it is not making people's lives safer, it is actually making it harder for law enforcement at the border to do their job.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Binder is saying securing the border makes the Border Patrol's job harder. Well, in a way, she's right because the job of Biden's Border Patrol is to process illegals, not catch and deport them.And what is it about Latin Americans pouring into Texas that Democrats like? If Russian nationals were pouring across the Bering Strait into Alaska seeking asylum, would Biden let them in? Or if Chinese nationals were landing in Hawaii on little rickety ships claiming refugee status, would Biden allow it? Of course not.Kamala told us what the goal is with Texas. She admitted she doesn't want to stop the invasion, she wants to speed it up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR AND SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: What are the solutions?KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The solution includes putting resources at the border to do what we can to process people effectively, and putting in place laws that actually allow for a meaningful pathway to citizenship.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Process more foreigners and put them on a pathway to citizenship, which means they vote.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JULIAN CASTRO (D), FORMER HUD SECRETARY: In a couple of presidential cycles, you'll be on election night, you'll be announcing that we're calling the 38th electoral votes of Texas for the Democratic nominee for president.It's changing. It is going to become a purple state and then a blue state because of demographics, because of the population growth of folks from outside of Texas.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And while six million illegals are waiting for amnesty and voting rights, the census counts them, and the more illegals you have, the more money and power the politicians get.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. YVETTE CLARKE (D-NY): I need more people in my district, just for redistricting purposes, and those members could clearly fit here.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Democrats also want the southern border invaded for crop picking and baby making.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JARED NADLER (D-NY): We need immigrants to this country. Our vegetables would rot in the ground if it weren't -- if they weren't being picked by many immigrants, many illegal immigrants.The fact is that the birthrate in this country is way below replacement level, which means our population is going to start shrinking. And the ratio of people on Social Security and Medicare is going to increase relative to the number of people supporting them.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So it doesn't matter that your son drops dead from fentanyl, your schools are overcrowded, your hospitals go bankrupt and your wages go down. None of that matters.Nadler's tomatoes are ripe and Texas turns blue.Every state must stand with Texas, because if we lose that battle, you're next.Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, joins us now.So what is next, Governor, if this thing looks like it's on a collision course and doesn't stop?RICK PERRY (R), FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR: Well, here's what I think is going to happen from a political standpoint is it was kind of intriguing to listen to the Castro brothers talking about how Texas is going to turn purple and then blue, and they're dreaming because what this administration is doing is turning Texas even more red, and it's really going to start getting red along the border where the historic Democratic Party was strong and because of this open border and open crime and open problem that we've got with drugs and all the other things that are happening along the border of Texas.Those Hispanic historic Democrats are becoming Republicans and becoming Republicans overwhelmingly. So I will suggest to you that the Castro boys may have been may talking about their pipe dream of seeing a blue Texas, but Texas is going to be even redder from a political standpoint.Now, you know, God bless Governor Abbott for what he's doing.WATTERS: Yes.PERRY: Let me tell you, he is fighting the fight. He is standing up doing what needs to be done in this country. I hope he finds more buses and more airplanes to send these individuals further into the United States, so the folks in New York and Chicago and Denver, those places that are begging and telling us oh, you cold-hearted people down there in Texas. You know, we're sanctuary cities up here, and you should be, too.Well, here's your chance to reflect that and I will suggest to you, it's just a bunch of blather, when they have to deal with this issue, and the cost of it and the cost to their citizens, not just in money, but in crime in having to deal with this from a Medicare standpoint, deal with this in their public schools, they are going to wish they had always been on the side of law and order, building a wall, building the technology, having the quick response teams to secure that border, like we did under the Trump administration and I will suggest to you that November of '24, in a short 10 months, you're going to see Americans turning out in droves sending a message about "We are fed up."WATTERS: Yes. I hope so. I know. I thought that was going to happen, Governor Perry during --I know very good. I hope that was going to happen during the midterms. It didn't happen the way I thought it did. And you know, Texas, it used to be deep red, Governor. I mean, Reagan won it huge. Bush won it huge, but it's just it's gotten more purple, if you look at the presidential margins.But let me ask you going forward in the week and the week after. What does it mean, when the Governor Abbott says no, we're not going to let you cut these fences down, we're going to put more up. And Biden says, oh, we're coming to cut these down. What does that look like?PERRY: Well, if that's the image that Joe Biden wants to send all across the country, that he is literally willing to go to war with one of his own states, then, you know, good luck with that, Mr. President, because I'm going to tell you, the people of America are sick of this immigration problem that we've got. They know why it's happening and they're going to stand up with Greg Abbott, with Governor Patrick with the Texas Legislature and push back hard as they should.This is just not acceptable. The people of America know it, Jesse.WATTERS: All right, well, I think "Fed Up" the book title thing speaks for every American, at least the ones that I talk to. Thank you so much, Governor.PERRY: God bless you, brother.WATTERS: Is Michelle Obama running for president?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Trump is in the strongest position he's ever been as a presidential candidate. He is beating Biden by six points in the latest Reuters poll, and while the media tells us he is a raving lunatic who should be in a padded room, a new report shows that behind-the-scenes, his campaign is a well-oiled machine firing on all cylinders.Trump's team is lean and full of seasoned pros, setting Trump up for four years of beautifully organized upheaval. Something voters have been begging for: "If he were to win and run the White House like he has his campaign, he could reshape America and its government more quickly and in more lasting ways than he did during his first term," and that scares the heck out of the press.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: Like Trump, Hitler was also viewed as a clown, a goon, who would be -- who could be kept in line. Trump and people like him appeal to a group of Americans who hate the modern, multicultural, and increasingly liberal, secular society they live in.RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: I think that we're naive to think that he is tricking people into picking him and then surprise, he is going to act like a dictator. That's what he's selling and that's what they're very eager to buy.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Anyone who gets things done in Washington has to be a dictator. We're so used to empty promises that the idea that a politician could get elected and deliver the policies that people voted for quickly and efficiently is so foreign that anybody who promises real change on day one has to be a strongman.They sound terrified Trump might secure the border, stop crime, and drill.Now, if you believe you want to put America first, you're a Nazi, according to them. If you want America, not first, you're a patriot. See, they're conditioning us to be ashamed of making our country great.Only the Nazis wanted a great country, I guess. James Carville says, we can't normalize wanting a great country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: There's a massive effort to normalize this. You see "The New York Times" column saying, well, the Trump people have a case. You see the head of JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States saying, well, they are right about some things.You see reporters, Jason Miller heading to Fort Des Moines Hotel reminds me of a bunch of German reporters in some Munich bar in 1935 saying, hey, Goring, he was an entertaining guy. I tell you what? He had some great stories. Nothing is normal about this at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Is it me or do the Democrats know they're about to lose? The press is so out of touch with the American people, they actually believe having a border is racist, preventing wars is dangerous, and high interest rates are great. They believe Biden is fine, but Trump is cognitive decline.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: . used to make beer brewed here, it is used to make the brew beered here, it is (gibberish). Ooh, Earth Rider, thanks for the Great Lakes. I wonder why is that.[LAUGHTER](END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: We told you Trump is beating Biden in the polls, except for one. One poll shows Biden has an 84 percent approval. With who? That would be the one percent.That's right, America's wealthiest East and West Coast media and tech executives with advanced degrees who run Wall Street, DC, and Silicon Valley overwhelmingly believe Biden is the best. They decide what's on TV, whose bills get passed, which campaigns get funded.The dirty little secret is that the professional class makes money dismantling America and selling it off for scrap. Anyone against their vulture capitalism gets smeared with a scarlet letter but wear it with a badge of honor, because their days are numbered.Elizabeth Pipko, political commentator joins us now.So it is kind of scary when all you want to do is make your country great again, and they call you a Nazi.ELIZABETH PIPKO, FOUNDER, LEST WE FORGET PROJECT: Yes, look, I cannot even tell you, Jesse, just how saddened I am by some of those clips that you just played. This country means everything to so many people, including my own two parents who fought tooth and nail to escape the Soviet Union and to come here.This country means everything, not just to people like you and me who are physically here, but to people around the world for whom we are a beacon of light and of hope.The United States is the single greatest nation on the face of the Earth because Americans wake up every single day ready to fight for the freedom of speech, thought, and expression not for themselves, but for whom they disagree with. That's what makes us great.We are the greatest country on the face of the Earth because we have fought for years now to remain united, despite any differences in politics or anything else. And shame on anyone trying to mess with that.WATTERS: When your parents were in the Soviet Union under totalitarianism, did they experience the same type of propaganda that you hear in the media today?PIPKO: One hundred percent. This is classic Soviet propaganda. It's let's divide our citizens, so they are so distracted by their hatred for one another. They don't realize what the leaders are doing for themselves, their country, and their futures.I need people to understand they're listening right now, like you said, this kind of division benefits literally only the top, the elite, the one percent. It does not benefit anybody else. If anything, this division hurts us.The only way for us to rise above it is do the opposite of what they want. To realize that our teachers, neighbors, even our family members are not the enemy regardless even of who they want to vote for this November.The way to rise above this and to prosper as individuals and as a nation is to stand together against those who are looking at us telling us they want us to be divided. They're fighting they're working overtime to divide us and the only way to beat them as a stand with those even those we disagree with and prove to them that's not the American way.MACDONALD: All right, Pipko, I stand with you. Everybody else does.Sorry to sadden you by the video clips, but we just had to get the message across.PIPKO: We are going to win, don't worry.WATTERS: We appreciate it. We are. Thank you.So we have a little update for you in the Fani Willis Lover Boy scandal. Today, a Georgia judge heard the case to release all information about the conversations Fani's office had with the White House. Remember, Fani partied with Kamala last year. Lover Boy met with Biden White House lawyers and Schiff colluded with Fani on the Georgia case.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HARRY MACDOUGALD, ATTORNEY: The White House as its fingerprints on all four criminal prosecutor issues of President Trump and now we know they have their fingerprints on this case.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: This alleged affair and collusion with the White House is causing a local revolt in Georgia. Fulton County residents want to defund the DA's office.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is clear we have abuse in the DA's office.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I do not support what Fani Willis is doing with my tax money.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm disgusted at the information that is coming out of the district attorney's office. As a taxpayer, I am done with most of your silence at the DA's apparent love affair with a special prosecutor and gross mismanagement of taxpayers' dollars to pursue what appears to be a frivolous lawsuit based off of partisan politics.Apparently guys like me, need to court Fulton County female executives if we want to free ride and all paid expense.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Fani is turning Fulton County into MAGA country. And then something happened, something always happens and it was bizarre.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Take me to church, I worship you dog. You're the light of my life. Please forgive me my sins, but I would fall on a knife.I go to work. I've got a free calm. Take me to church. I write a cheque. They let me say a few words, so I got to do everything.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Well, stealing is now considered healthcare.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Sometimes you just have to speed.["LOOK WHO'S TALKING" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]MOLLIE UBRIACCO, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: St. Jerome's Hospital.JAMES UBRIACCO, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: [Bleep].UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, are you stupid?MOLLIE UBRIACCO: Hey, slow down. The first stage of labor can take hours.JAMES UBRIACCO: Yes, we'll go to Midtown traffic. Hold on.MOLLIE UBRIACCO: You stupid son of a [bleep].(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: California Democrats want to give Big Brother the power to pump your brakes and physically prevent your car from going more than 10 miles over the speed limit. They call it the Speed Governor.State Senator Scott Wiener is sponsoring the bill, which will make it mandatory in every new car made in 2027. This technology will track where you're driving and control the pedal so you can't speed.The proposal says drivers would be able to temporarily disable the feature, but you have to give it a good reason. Who has time to pull over and give your car reason to speed when your wife's going into labor or you're about to get carjacked?Pharmacies are essential businesses. They have our prescriptions. They have many of mine -- our toiletries, greeting cards -- you know the important stuff.In DC, thieves just ran a CVS out of business. After months of organized looting, the shelves completely bare. Criminals were openly selling the stuff they stole around the corner. But weirdly, people were okay with it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot of folks actually can't afford any of the things in there. I'm not saying that stealing has to be the solution to that, right? However, I don't know, maybe the city could provide more access for resources to unhoused, under income folks that can provide them like hair care, bodily care, hygiene care, et cetera. That could be an option.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Hair care? Bodily care? Hygiene care?PRIMETIME believes that hair products are necessary. No one believes that more than PRIMETIME, but we don't think you can slap the word care on the end of an item to justify stealing it.This guy is at an area REI store. Look at him, he was engaged in a little camping care, which apparently requires seven pairs of the same sweatpants. And then there's this guy, needs a little watch care, which is understandable. I mean, we all need to be on time.Don't forget about cash care. This fella needed it so badly he was willing to shoot someone.Or wine care, that I understand. Who doesn't need a nice cold Chard after a long day of doing crime? Okay, this guy just little carjacking, maybe they probably needed a ride.Washington, DC is supposed to be America's crown jewel. It's the land of our Founding Fathers and the place where our laws are written, but the people who live there have been conditioned into thinking that those laws are not meant to be followed.The city's leaders have let it go to hell, but someone wants to fix it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will take over the horribly run capital of our nation, Washington, DC, it's a mess, and clean up and renovate and rebuild our capital city so that it's no longer a nightmare of murder and crime but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Here now is DC resident, Elissa de Souza.Elissa, I mean have you ever jacked a bunch of tops and just called it fashion care?ELISSA DE SOUZA, WASHINGTON, DC RESIDENT: No, I just find it rather disturbing. I can't even go to the store to buy simple deodorant.WATTERS: Well, what about the people that are stealing the deodorant and then walking around the corner and hawking it for twice the price?DE SOUZA: I think it's ridiculous. I think people should be held more accountable in DC. You have security officers that are placed in these local stores and they are just told that they are just there to protect the employees and you know, not be able to arrest anybody for walking out with multiple products. It's been really scary.WATTERS: So if you try to steal an employee, then the security guard can do something. But if you just steal every product in the store, the security guy just has to watch.DE SOUZA: Pretty much. It is going on in my area. It's really scary just turning the corner and walking down the streets to just go to shopping in any local store. It's scary being a female walking around in the area and never knowing when you're going to get carjacked or something is going to be stolen right off of you.WATTERS: Is that why you guys carry mace?DE SOUZA: I mean, it is nice to carry that now that it's been approved. But I don't know at the end of the day how that really protects me.WATTERS: All right, Elissa, thank you so much. Stay safe and I hope you can get the deodorant that you need.Don't go anywhere, it is DEI Thursday.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AL SHARPTON, MSNBC HOST: We will be doing this on a weekly basis. DEI is something we must have.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Yes, it is Thursday. You know what that means? That's right. Happy DEI Thursday.As allies of Al Sharpton, PRIMETIME celebrates the holiday. So let's start things off at the University of Wisconsin where first year law students were forced to denounce Whiteness at a mandatory orientation.A pamphlet given to students read: "You may have attended many anti-racism workshops. You may not be shouting racist epithets, or actively discriminating against people of color, but you still experience privilege"Oh, and students in attendance were told that White people "aren't exceptional." Some might argue with that since the White founder of the University of Wisconsin was a little exceptional.In Washington State, politicians want to change the term sex offender to person who has committed a sex offense or person with lived experience of committing a sex offense because that flows right off the tongue. They believe that the Sexual Offender Policy Board, a committee dedicated to reviewing sexual assault doesn't have enough sex offenders on it.Oh, and they also want an Indian on the board, too.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those four new members include a representative from a community based organization advocating for persons convicted of sex offenses, a representative from a federally recognized Indian tribe in the state, a representative with lived experience with incarceration for a sex offense and a representative with lived experience as the victim of a sex offense.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But we have some good news, too. A school board in Pennsylvania has reclaimed their Native American mascot.Susquehanna High School is bringing back the Warriors after local Democrat politicians got rid of the name back in 2021 because of its mockery, but the case was never really the case. Locals said it honored Native Americans, not mocked them. It was a symbol of empowerment.Speaking of mascots, PRIMETIME introduces you to a very important advocate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Hi, everyone. I am Shitani (ph). My persona is a King Cheetah and I've been a furry since 2012. This style of costume isn't only a last resort for furries, who are neurodivergent or disabled.We have them because we like how they look. Not every first suiter wants to be a cute and cuddly stuffed animal. Many of us envision our characters as something wilder.My fur suit was designed specifically to match my persona.We just ask to keep an open mind. Be respectful. And let us be weird animal people in our way.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Let's bring in radio show host, Tommy Sotomayor.Tommy, you look like you want to talk about the furries.TOMMY SOTOMAYOR, RADIO SHOW HOST: I'm telling you, I don't know what to do. We need a safe space right now for sanity, for sane people, because the insanity has run amok, man.WATTERS: I mean, it's DEI Thursday. We are forced to celebrate this courtesy of the reverend. I don't know about you, but White people aren't exceptional and I would put myself in that category.SOTOMAYOR: Well, you're not I'm telling you. Let me tell you something. I'm a San Francisco 49er fan. And you know how many White running back star in the NFL? One. And we got him.And let me tell you something, because there's only one of them out of 32 teams, that lets me know Whites aren't exceptional, but what we need to do is have diversity and equity and inclusion. So I need you, Jesse and the rest of the White people to stand up and say we need more White running backs.WATTERS: We need more White running backs on every team that plays the Eagles, my team. That's the only time that I'll allow that, and White cornerbacks, too, that'll be fun.SOTOMAYOR: Yes. There hasn't been a White cornerback since Jason Sehorn.WATTERS: And there'll never be another one, Tommy. Tell me about the mascot game? Because I've never heard of this before. You only hear stories about canceling American Indian mascots. They've reclaimed the Indian mascot. And this is a huge breaking story on DEI Thursday.SOTOMAYOR: Well, first off, we need more stories like that. We need the Washington Redskins back. I don't really know what they're doing with the mascots and then the furries, they threw me off because I was like, well, aren't they technically a mascot? And couldn't they be a mascot for the insanity that the people have?But I'm really glad that that school has decided to stop just kowtowing to liberal movements, which make no sense. They are -- I mean, what's next? The Yankees should be upset, right? That's a mascot that should be upset.WATTERS: That's true.SOTOMAYOR: The Yankees, people up north they should be upset by that.WATTERS: The Vikings.SOTOMAYOR: The Fighting Irish.WATTERS: Yes, what about the Fighting Irish? What about the Vikings? What about the Raiders? I thought that guy look White on the helmet. Why don't we do this, Tommy? Why don't we make the Redskins the furries, the Washington furries. And I think a lot of those sick, kinky freaks in DC would love it.SOTOMAYOR: And see, that's another one of my problems. I know we make jokes and things like that and I enjoy that. You allow that, but when I watch these adults in these so-called furry outfits, the only thing that I can think of is who is it they're trying to attract?We realize who was trying to be attracted when we had Joe Camel. Well, what are these people trying to do when they're trying to be cuddly animals? Think about it. I don't like the precedent that it sets.When we're dealing with DEI, I think they need to have diversity, inclusion and equity and therefore it will be called DIE and hopefully one day it will D-I-E and then at the end of that they'll teach people how to D-I-Y or to do it themselves, because that's the problem. They want the government to do it for them. So let's get to that. Well, let's get to D-I-Y.WATTERS: All right, you're right. DEI is DOA on PRIMETIME.Tommy, thank you so much.SOTOMAYOR: Thank you.WATTERS: But before we go, we can't finish DEI Thursday without mentioning that Biden's chief diversity and inclusion officer is leaving the administration.Michael Leach was the first ever DEI officer in White House history and we wish Michael well and expect Joe Biden to fill that role soon.Also, do Democrats want to get rid of Joe? Johnny finds out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Does Joe Biden deserve another four years?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Taxes are crazy now [bleep].(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: According to a gossip column in "The New York Post," Michelle Obama could be running for president.The plan: Biden announces he isn't running around May and Michelle sweeps in at the convention.

She almost seized it.Another thing, when you're doing stretches alone, especially the child's pose, you shouldn't walk in on anybody doing a child's pose. It's a very personal stretch and no man should be seen doing the child's pose. So if the door is closed, it's closed for a reason, people.Also go get my book. You can preorder it, "Get It Together." There it is right now.

It all adds up when you order "Get It Together."Let's do texts.Teresa from Jersey: I know how to stop the migrant crisis. Just give them all MAGA hats.
