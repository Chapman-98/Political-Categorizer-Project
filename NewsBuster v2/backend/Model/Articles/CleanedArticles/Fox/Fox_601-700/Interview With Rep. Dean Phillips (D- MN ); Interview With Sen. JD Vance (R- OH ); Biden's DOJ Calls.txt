RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: And how are you improving my community? How are you keeping me safe?LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Crime in the border.ARROYO: And what about my income, and the border?INGRAHAM: All right, Raymond, just -- it's been such a rough week for all of them. All of them.Raymond, have a great weekend.ARROYO: Go have a great weekend.INGRAHAM: That's it for us tonight. Stay connected with us and it's Jesse next.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)PAUL BEGALA, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I'm a Biden supporter, and I slept like a baby last night. I woke up every two hours crying and wet the bed.WATTERS: Democrats wetting the bed. Now the fun begins.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER US SECRETARY OF STATE: It's important that we --(PROTESTERS SHOUTING.)CLINTON: Okay, all right, we're going to -- we're going to stop.WATTERS: Hillary just can't catch a break.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)CLINTON: That's my name. That's right.PROTESTER: You are a war criminal.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)STEPHEN A. SMITH, ESPN HOST: How in the hell do we come up with a $53 million pilot program for illegals, but folks who are born here, we don't have enough for them.WATTERS: Look around. Is it me or is everyone America First?(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)(PEOPLE CHANTING "USA.")WATTERS: Plus --(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: Great presidents have always put country over ego, and one of the biggest sacrifices you can make as president is knowing when your time is up.In 1848, President James Polk announced he wasn't running for a second term. The reason? He accomplished everything he wanted to accomplish in one term and he had poor health and it was the right decision because Polk died just months into what would have been the beginning of his second term.The American people should never gamble with their presidential vote and Biden knows this better than anyone.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NORAH O'DONNELL, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: Is age a legitimate issue?JOE BIDEN, THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It is a legitimate issue, sure it is. And I think people are going to judge it -- if I were to run, I think they're going to judge me on my vitality.Can I still run up the steps of Air Force 2? Am I still in good shape? Am I going to have all my faculties? Am I -- am I energetic? I think it's totally legitimate that people ask those questions.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Joe Biden now lumbers up the short steps of Air Force One, has diminished faculties, and based on his schedule, lacks energy. The president's own Justice Department spent five hours with him and concluded he is painfully slow and struggles to remember events and couldn't even remember when he was vice president, asking: "If it was in 2013, when did I stop being vice president?" Also asking, "In 2009, am I still vice president"The president's garage looks like a man who has diminished faculties because lumped in next to broken lamps and potting soil were boxes of top secret American intelligence documents.I judge a man by how organized his garage and basement are, you know, the places that only the homeowner sees and this wasn't good.The special counsel said he wouldn't charge President Biden because a jury would view him as a sympathetic doddering old man who couldn't be held accountable because he couldn't remember. He couldn't even remember when his own son died. The president was furious that this came out and has been screaming at his staff all day and it showed when he appeared at eight o'clock in the evening last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am well-meaning and I'm an elderly man, and I know what the hell I'm doing. I've been president, I put this country back on its feet. I don't need his recommendation. It is totally --PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: How bad is your memory and can you continue as president?BIDEN: My memory is so bad I let you speak.REPORTER: People have been watching and they have expressed concerns about your age.BIDEN: That is your judgment. That is your judgment.REPORTER: This is according to public polling. They express concern --BIDEN: That is not the judgments of the press.As you know, initially, the president of Mexico, El Sisi --(CROSSTALK)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: What you heard at the end was the president confusing the leaders of Egypt and Mexico and after shaking his fist and proclaiming he has a fond memory and he knows what the hell he's doing.Playing the loyal soldier, Kamala called the whole thing a witch hunt.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When I saw that report last night, I believe is -- as a former prosecutor, the comments that were made by that prosecutor -- gratuitous, inaccurate and inappropriate.The president's demeanor in that report was characterized, could not be more wrong on the facts and clearly, politically motivated.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Kamala has lunch with Biden once a week. She knows the president's demeanor better than anyone. Everyone who works with the president knows he's slow, but the White House has orchestrated one of the biggest coverups in American political history and it is all now coming out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: If the special counsel says President Biden's got significant limitations on his memory, then who is helping him run the country?KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president of the United States runs the country. The commander-in-chief runs the country.DOOCY: How can he be trusted with the nuclear codes if -- I get that you're saying that, but nobody in the building would say that he's got an issue with his memory. But just the little part of what we get to see, he's made mistake after mistake after mistake after mistake on camera this week.JEAN-PIERRE: So I'm going to be very clear here. The reality is that report, that part of the report does not live in reality, it just doesn't.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But the reality is last night, Democrats were wetting the bed.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEGALA: Look, I'm a Biden supporter and I slept like a baby last night. I woke up every two hours crying and wet the bed. This is -- this is terrible for Democrats and anybody with a functioning brain knows that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: After waking up in their damp beds, the political pros are getting ready to pull the plug.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID AXELROD, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: He is 12 years older than or more than when I worked with him -- 15 years older than when I worked with him, so yes, he's not exactly the same. This has been something that's been plaguing the president throughout this campaign and before this sense that he has lost his step, that he's not with it.Public perception is formed by how you perform in front of the camera and on that, I think the President has lost a step and it has hurt him and it has created these questions that are the central challenge for him in this campaign.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So Paul Begala and Dave Axelrod represent the Clinton and Obama political machines and they are secretly rooting for Biden to announce he is not running for re-election for personal reasons that we don't have time to get into, but the left has been given cover now to say aloud what they've been whispering amongst each other for years.Behind-the-scenes, Jill Biden and White House staff had been keeping the president in a bubble. After Biden took questions at a news conference just last year, sources say Jill's look on her face told everyone in the room from the president on down that they had some explaining to do.She demanded to know why didn't anyone stop that? Telling staff: "Where was the person who was going to end the press conference?" The media participated in the coverup knowing there were issues, but they never thought the reality of his mental state would be certified by the Justice Department.Suddenly, the press began fact checking the president watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: One thing that President Biden said is basically that he stored the documents in filing cabinets that could be locked.DANIEL DALE, CNN REPORTER: Just -- just not true.BERMAN: Another claim that President Biden made, none of the documents were highly classified.DALE: That claim that he didn't have any material that was "high classified" is also not true.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Not only is Biden now verifiably diminished, but he lied multiple times about what was in the report, that he is a reckless mess that shares classified information and exposes National Security secrets and has a garage that looks like a "Hoarders" episode.This undercuts the entire rationale of the Biden presidency, a wise statesman who we could trust to manage America and the world, but everywhere around us was mismanaged from the border to the streets to the Middle East.Now, deep down, the media is relieved they can stop lying about how Biden is Einstein.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: This is becoming a five- alarm fire for the White House.JEFFREY TOOBIN, AUTHOR AND FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Mexico? Mexico? Where did that come from? And politically, how do you explain that?SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": To mix up the president of Egypt with the president of Mexico because his name sounds like Sisi? That's bizarre.JIMMY FALLON, "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON" HOST: It's pretty embarrassing for Biden, but on the bright side, he'll forget about it five minutes later.MICHAEL STEELE, FORMER RNC CHAIR: Let's just thank God this is not October, because if it were, it would be, you know, a Comey moment in the Hillary Clinton situation where you the justice side of the three branches kind of weighs in, so it is weighty.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But most partisan media is still clinging to the big lie that the Big Guy is with it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HAYES: "Painfully slow," and I just thought, well, who's in pain? Like what -- that adverb is such a -- it is doing so much work editorially.You were in pain because it takes too long --MSNBC GUEST: If you asked me to, you know, identify precisely when I was where, what years, et cetera, I would have a -- you know, under that sort of adversarial questioning, I would have a tough time too.JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Why did want to remember the day that his son died?KATE BEDINGFIELD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I promise everybody on this panel right now has misspoken and said the wrong name or the wrong, you know, the wrong date in a conversation.ARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST: Let's call it what it is. This is ageism snuck into a report.HAYES: The man is 80 years old.MADDOW: He rides a bike.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Oh, he thinks Mexico is in the Middle East, but he can ride a bike.Now, when the media is divided, it's dangerous for the Democratic Party because a mob only works when it fights in unison. The left is most effective when it's all reading the same talking points and repeating them with commendable discipline.Now once the propaganda splinters, the Democratic Party is exposed and can't stand. CNN and MSNBC duking it out over who is running the country is fatal for Democrat chances next year. This leaves Democrat politicians in survival mode. They will have to distance themselves from the top of the ticket and they won't have the media running interference for them by keeping the heat on Trump.On the right, it has kept the left on the defensive now for two straight weeks, first on the border; now on Biden's brain. They should push the corruption issue because the impeachment factor will highlight the bribes. We don't have answers for that yet. And the media, which, above all else is a business can't hitch their wagons to the oldest, most unpopular president staring down the barrel of an impeachment, who is losing to Trump in every battleground, sees dead people, and whose son is facing nine felonies.How can the media say vote for a man with diminished faculties? How does that save democracy?We're at a crossroads now and responsible adults have to choose what's best for the country. Dean Phillips is a Democrat running for president. He joins PRIMETIME.Dean, what was your reaction to that report? And then that press conference, do you think the president has what it takes?REP. DEAN PHILLIPS (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, Jesse, and thanks for having me on by the way.You know, it was sad. You know, most patriotic Americans probably watched that press conference, saw a decent man, and I want to really defend him, he is a decent man and I have to get in front of the country and talk about his son Beau, defend himself from these charges. I thought it was a sad day.And frankly, and I think you would all agree. We wouldn't be having these conversations if he was not running for president again.I respect him, but that's the problem, and by the way, Donald Trump, not that far behind him. I think that's the problem, Jesse, 77 percent of the country wants to move on from this chapter. We have two presidents, a former president, a current president, that frankly, people have lost faith in and I think, broadly. And that's why I'm extremely excited that we might have an opportunity to have a next generation president.And just imagine, Jesse, if we had a president, Democrat or Republican in the White House, who actually wanted to solve problems, work with members on both sides of the aisle in the White House. That's my proposition. And I sure hope we get the chance because this is tragic.WATTERS: Well, I don't know if anyone's going to get the chance they might be stuck with Joe Biden and in terms of mental capacity, and Trump is lightyears ahead of Joe Biden, just look at him and the polls show the same thing.But you say decency, he's a decent man. You can squabble with that, but wouldn't a decent leader maybe put the country above his legacy and his ego and do the right thing? Or is that Jill's job?PHILLIPS: No, Jesse, in fact, I was the first Democrat in July of 2022, to publicly call on the president to pass the torch. He implied he would only serve one term, of course. I've been doing that on a mission. I invited other candidates who are better known than me to enter the race because democracy requires competition. The GOP has a number of candidates running right now, of course.And yes, I think he should be putting both his own legacy and the country most importantly, ahead. And I think he is making the wrong decision for both by running again.I've been making that contention much to the chagrin of my colleagues, as you well know, but I'm just saying the quiet part out loud, Jesse. I wish we had more here in Washington, who are willing to torpedo their careers in Congress, so as not to torpedo the country.WATTERS: All right, Also important, Chiefs or 9ers, Dean?PHILLIPS: You're putting me -- that's the hardest -- THAT'S the hardest question for a politician to answer. I've got to go.WATTERS: Why?PHILLIPS: I'm going to go -- look, I'm a Midwestern. I'm going to go with the Chiefs.WATTERS: All right.PHILLIPS: California and New York get way too much love.WATTERS: All right, thanks, Dean. Have a nice weekend.PHILLIPS: Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Ohio Senator JD Vance joins me now.All right, Senator. You know, you heard Dean Phillips say he's a decent man. I think decent men see country first. Does Joe Biden see country first?SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH): Look, Jesse, I don't think so. I think this is all about ego, because if he cared about the country first, he would recognize what is obvious to everyone, even many Democrats, that they simply can't do the job.Look, I agree with Dean Phillips that what I saw yesterday was sad. This is a person who is clearly incapable of carrying on his duties. This is a person who has clearly lost a step, but I'm most sad not for Joe Biden, but for the people he leads as president of the United States.And I have to just respond to this point, Jesse, you hear this sometimes said by Democrats that, yes, Joe Biden has lost a step, but so has Donald Trump. I don't know how any honest, self-respecting person can look at Joe Biden at that press conference yesterday, compare it to Donald Trump and say that these are two people who are in the same place mentally.It's just obviously fake and not true. Trump's got the energy. He's got the memory. He's got the verve to do the job. Biden is a guy who is clearly going to need to go hide in the basement if he has any chance of re- election because if that is the image they present to the American people for the next six months, we're going to win in a landslide, Jesse, because that is terrifying to think that guy has the nuclear codes and controls our national defense.WATTERS: You can't both sides that issue. Everybody knows that. I've heard your name mentioned as VP. You could be on this Trump ticket. That might mean you might have to debate Kamala Harris, are you going to prepare for that or just wing it?VANCE: Well, like I've told a lot of people, Jesse, obviously, if the president asked me, I'd be very interested. But look, I like being a senator. I think it's the best way for me to serve the people of Ohio, and until the president actually makes the ask, I am not going to think about the nightmare of having to stand next to Kamala Harris, but it would be fun.It would be fun to go after a little bit because maybe she's the one insurance policy that could keep Joe Biden in office. She's the only person who'd be worse than them.WATTERS: All right, and if a fly lands in your head, you Swat that thing right off, all right?VANCE: That's right.WATTERS: All right, JD Vance, thank you so much.VANCE: Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Lava, migrant man hunts and DEI Friday ahead on PRIMETIME.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Hillary Clinton probably thought she was getting a safe cushy job when she teamed up with Columbia. Shows up to campus a couple of times a month, lecture, lunch, leave by four, collect the cheque.But sadly for Hillary, that hasn't been the case. It turns out, young liberals hate her. She can't go anywhere on campus without getting heckled.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Thank you very much.PROTESTER: Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton.CLINTON: That's my name.PROTESTER: You are a war criminal. The people of Libya, the people of Iraq, the people of Syria, the people of Yemen, the people of Palestine, as well as the people of America, will never forgive you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sir, you are violating the university --PROTESTER: (INAUDIBLE).UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm asking you to leave. The delegates will now escort you out of the building. Thank you.PROTESTER: (INAUDIBLE). You will burn.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you? Sir.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now, if Columbia University isn't a safe space for Hillary, the Democrats have a real problem. The young left is livid with the Old Guard like Clinton and Biden for their foreign policy, and there is nowhere to escape.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PROTESTER: Free, free Palestine. Free, free Palestine. Free, free Palestine.CLINTON: Okay. Let me thank all of you for coming, because this is --(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Oh, Hillary's class was like a whack-a-mole. Pull one protester out and other one pops right up.(END VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Why don't all of you just interrupt me so that you won't be interrupting our panelists so that we don't have this kind of disruption when we have people who are real experts in this area.And so, I think it's -- I think it's important to focus on the event we're here. People are free to protest, but they're not free to disrupt events or classes.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Hillary and Joe can't go anywhere on an American campus without getting an earful like that, which is why Bill Clinton has now volunteered to go on a nationwide campus tour instead.There are two questions on every Democrats' mind: When is Biden dropping out? And who's going to replace him?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOSTIN: Choose an off ramp here, and I think we need off ramps that we need to think about is, once all of the delegates are received, the DNC will be certifying the delegates, right, and the count, and Gavin Newsom can be swapped out.GRIFFIN: Why not the vice president? Why not? Why wouldn't the Democrats --HOSTIN: This country is not ready for a Black female president. We couldn't even elect one of the most qualified White women in this country as president.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: All right, so a Black woman says America is too racist and sexist for someone like me, we need a White man, because the White man we have now is too old.These are the kinds of conversations Democrats are having today, and Jesse agrees with Sunny, Kamala is not the answer, because she's the only Democrat more unpopular than Biden.Feeding Kamala to Donald Trump would not only doom DEI Thursdays, but Democrats might lose worse than Mondale.Then there's Newsom who enjoyed a nice bottle of Napa Cab while reading the Hur report last night, I'm sure. He has the height, hair, youth, and money and pays attention to PRIMETIME because he took our advice, and went undercover to see what California is really like, slapped on a hat, picked up trash on the side of the street.But if the Democrats replace Kamala with Gav, then it triggers an identity politics Civil War and there are no guarantee Newsom beats Trump at all. It's unlikely, so why waste him? Keep him undefeated and hold him fresh for '28.The Hail Mary is coronating Michelle Obama at the convention in Chicago. It's her hometown, but she just got a taste of the good life. She doesn't really want to work in the White House and fight with Barack about who's really in charge.So Democrats are stuck with Biden. It might be better to lose with Joe than anyone else. But as we've seen with Democrats, when they know they're going to lose, they fight dirty.Charlie Spiering is the author of "Amateur Hour," and a political reporter for DailyMail.com.Charlie, you did a deep dive into the Kamala world. What do you think's going on right now after this report just dropped?CHARLIE SPIERING, AUTHOR, "AMATEUR HOUR": Yes, Jesse, it is really bad because Democrats are increasingly talking quietly behind the scenes about how can they get Gavin Newsom, how can they get someone like Gretchen Whitmer even to take Biden's place but while at this point, there's really a big problem with Kamala Harris.WATTERS: Is Kamala excited about this report dropping? Was she enjoying Joe Biden going out with the blaze of glory last night at 8:15?SPIERING: Well, you saw her press conference tonight. Today, she complained that, you know, the special counsel report was a disaster and it was full of bad political attacks, and boy, if anyone knows about bad political attacks, it's Kamala Harris herself because she attacked Biden for being -- treating him as a racist during the 2020 campaign.WATTERS: So there's no shot that the kingmakers are considering Kamala. They are really just looking right at Newsom, right at Gretchen, and just hoping things work themselves out. It could get messy in Chicago at the convention this summer. How do you see that convention shaking out?SPIERING: Well, right now they're just praying that Biden can get back on his feet and make it past the finish line because there's no way they want to see the 25th Amendment get a vote for someone who's polling really low right now, 28 percent approval rating.So they can only hope that Biden makes it across the finish line so they don't have to have these uncomfortable conversations with their base on why they have to reject the historic first Black woman president in favor of somebody else.WATTERS: Yes, this is probably one of the worst stretches for the Democrats in a very long time.Everybody go check out the book, "Amateur Hour." Charlie, have a great weekend.SPIERING: Thanks for having me, Jesse.WATTERS: Who are migrants voting for? We found out.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: America's migrant crime crisis is spiraling out of control and the White House is threatening to throw grease on the fire. The US Marshals arresting 15-year-old, Jesus Alejandro Rivas Figueroa -- you're welcome -- after he opened fire at police last night and shot a tourist in Times Square.The Venezuelan migrant and two others were confronted while shoplifting when Jesus pulled out his piece and started blasting willy-nilly.Now, Jesus may be young, but this isn't his first rodeo. He is wanted for two other gun related charges here in New York, including armed robbery just last week. I'm sure Jesus told whoever sent him to New York that he had no criminal record and would be on his best behavior.The wild shootout comes after a different group of migrants pummeled two NYPD officers and then fled to Arizona. These are the people Joe Biden is ushering into our country. Biden is just blasting a firehose of migrants into America at a record clip.Look at this. This is the last hundred years of border crossers. As you can see what Joe Biden has done to this country is unlike anything that's ever happened. It's an absolute explosion of illegal immigration that shows no signs of stopping unless he is defeated.But you haven't seen anything yet. If Biden doesn't get his sweetheart border deal pushed through Congress, the White House says they'll drop a migrant bomb on the whole country and cut ICE deportations even further. Watch.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)JEAN-PIERRE: Because congressional Republicans are choosing partisan politics over our national security and refusing to pass the bipartisan national security agreement that includes significant border reforms and funding over the coming weeks, ICE will be forced to reduce operations because of budget shortfalls.(END AUDIO CLIP)WATTERS: Pass our bill or we will let even more migrants into the country? That only sounds good to AOC. Now, well Jerry Nadler wants migrants to pick his crops, AOC wants them to take care of your grandparents.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): We do not talk about the enormous blessing, economic blessing that immigrants and immigration represents to the United States of America. We currently do not have the economic or social structural capacity to take care of our seniors, and we will increasingly not have that if we "lock up" our border and shut down -- shut down immigration.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: AOC wants illegal border crossers to be given full amnesty so they can spoon feed grandpa soup while he watches yours truly. She says illegal aliens are givers, not takers, and she's right. Giving us the middle finger and debt.We don't have anything against immigrants. We have a problem with the illegal immigrants. There's only so much money to go around.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SMITH: We've got poor, impoverished, starving people who were born and raised in this nation. How in the hell do we come up with a $53 million pilot program for illegals, but folks who are here legally, are born here, we don't have enough.That's why Trump is on the verge of getting elected.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Stephen A is America First, thanks to Biden. So who's Biden going to replace Stephen A with? We found him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(NICK SHIRLEY SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)TRANSLATION: And if you could vote who would you vote for?(UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)TRANSLATION: Of course, for Biden.(NICK SHIRLEY SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)TRANSLATION: If you have the privilege to vote, who are you going to vote for?(UNIDENTIFIED MALE AND FEMALE speaking in foreign language)TRANSLATION: Joe Biden. He is helping us here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the majority are for BidenUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He is the one helping us, Biden.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Biden.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Nick Shirley has been on the ground talking to these migrants as they come into the country and he joins us now. So Nick, do they understand they're not really legally allowed to vote?SHIRLEY: I don't know. I think they're all pretty excited to be supporting. Joe.WATTERS: Do you have anybody that ever tells you? Yes, yes, yes, Donald Trump.SHIRLEY: Never.WATTERS: Never.SHIRLEY: Never.WATTERS: And you've talked to a lot of migrants.SHIRLEY: I've talked to hundreds of migrants and they all love Sleepy Joe.WATTERS: They all love Joe Biden. Do they ever say anything about Kamala?SHIRLEY: I don't even think they know she exists.WATTERS: Okay, neither do Americans.What is the weirdest thing that's ever happened to you? You've been traveling around with these migrants for quite some time.SHIRLEY: Weirdest thing that happened. One time I let some ex-cartel members into the car to give us more insight about migrants and it turned out to be ex-cartel members.WATTERS: What did they do?SHIRLEY: They took us to where they smuggle in the migrants.WATTERS: Wow. What did they show you?SHIRLEY: Exactly how they bring them through into America.WATTERS: And how much does it cost to get into this country?SHIRLEY: Each person is paying around five to ten thousand dollars.WATTERS: Five to ten thousand dollars.SHIRLEY: Yes.WATTERS: So the cartels are just swimming in cash.SHIRLEY: Yes, they're making lots of money.WATTERS: Okay, so the only wages that have increased are cartel wages, the American wages, they're downed by inflation. Do you ever feel like sympathy for these migrants? Many of them are coming here, really horrible circumstances. None of them are really fleeing because they fear anything. They're here to work. How does that make you feel?SHIRLEY: You know, a lot of the migrants, they are good people and they come through with good intentions. However, if you let in eight million people over the course of three years, a lot of bad people are going to come in as well.WATTERS: Bad hombres, like the guy that's looking off shots right near our headquarters. You know, I am not going to say I almost got shot, I'm going to sound like Joe Biden, but when I left the building the other day they had police tape all outside. This is crazy.SHIRLEY: Yes, it's getting really bad and there's no signs of it slowing down.WATTERS: All right, well, thank you very much. Tell them when they get to this country watch, JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.SHIRLEY: Will do.WATTERS: Thank you very much.DE Friday is on fire.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: We are going to do this on a weekly basis. DEI is something we must have.WATTERS: Last night, President Biden disrespected Al Sharpton by hijacking DEI Thursday with his disastrous address, but PRIMETIME is not going to let anything get in the way of bringing you our favorite stories about diversity, equity and inclusion, so we are celebrating on Friday this week, starting with this.PRIMETIME has noticed White liberals have a strange kink for racial humiliation, but ridding yourself of White guilt can get awfully expensive. But don't worry, it is worth it.Self-proclaimed anti-oppression coach, Wanda Swan -- Hey Wanda -- no relation to Wanda the stuffer says she can reprogram Whites to not be racist for 1,500 bucks. Wanda will teach you about the throuples of Whiteness. Whiteness as a construct, Whiteness as a racial marker, and White supremacy. It's like the holy trinity of White guilt.Wanda says racism is our muscle memory, but she's happy to beat it out of you if the price is right.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WANDA SWAN, SELF-PROCLAIMED ANTI-OPPRESSION COACH: There's really no space for White identified and White assimilated folks to go in and say, what the (bleep) is wrong with me? Or what the (bleep) is wrong with my culture? Or even after I read all the books, even after I go to all the lectures, even after I do this and do that, I still have this muscle memory.A lot of my work is digging down into that oppressive muscle memory and replacing it with anti-oppressive muscle memory.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Up next, we've got a PRIMETIME victory, Zoom is gutting the DEI team it hired in the wake of the Floyd riots. The software company is learning that DEI doesn't drive business, even if half of us are working from home.Zoom realized it doesn't matter if a non-binary they/them picks up the customer service line. People just want a video call into work meetings from bed in their underwear.But it's not just a Zoom. Big tech companies like Google and Facebook have quietly left DEI to D-I-E. Everyone is getting it. DEI job listings down to 44 percent last year. No one's going to hire you if it's racist to fire you.And finally, one Republican candidate for Missouri Secretary of State is torching graphic sex books for kids. Literally.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VALENTINA GOMEZ NORIEGA (R), CANDIDATE FOR MISSOURI SECRETARY OF STATE: These are what I will do to the grooming books when I become Secretary of State.These books come from a Missouri public library.

It has nothing to do with Taylor Swift. Nothing at all. We're going with the 9ers.All right, we've got some texts coming up. Let's see them.Matt, Sarasota, Florida: If Biden is competent, then he should be prosecuted. Simple.Yes, I told my wife, Emma about the whole thing last night and she was confused.

She can't stand it. She thinks it's a conspiracy theory. I just say it's a theory.Eric from Hendersonville, North Carolina: It sounds like the media is starting to get Biden derangement syndrome.It's about time someone gets another derangement syndrome than Trump.Malcolm from Yorktown, Virginia: If you look in my garage, you'll see I'm VP material.I don't know about you guys, but if you see someone's garage, and it looks disgusting, don't you kind of judge them? Like the rest of the house can be immaculate, but you look at the garage and it's a pigsty. Something's wrong with that person. Get it together. Not a book club, but get it together.John from Grayling, Michigan: Yo, think I can get my hands on that treadmill in Biden's garage?Seriously. It looks like a sale going on there.Chris from Mattoon, Illinois: JD Vance would make the perfect VP choice for Trump, professional and brilliant.I think he'd make a great person on the ticket. The beard apparently it's either workout or grow a beard. We'll see.Joshua from Oklahoma: Quit saying Michelle Obama. You will curse us.You think I'm going to manifest Michelle into the White House? I'm powerful, but I'm not that powerful.Bob from Florida: You think the Michelle thing is funny? Every time you say your name on "The Five," I skip you at the eight.Never do that.Sherry from Moline, Illinois: So let me get this straight. The guy who is so manly, he won't use a straw in public, loves Ryan Gosling movies?I don't love his movies. I'm just saying if I see a movie with Gosling in it, I'm intrigued.Tony from Colorado: It's cool, bro. I like Gosling and Gyllenhaal, too.It doesn't mean I have a homosexual crush on them. I'm just saying I appreciate their acting skills. Very strong heterosexual credentials.DVR the show. Someone snickered. I'm Watters and this is my world.
