We'll see.INGRAHAM: Raymond, I know, we're going to hear from the Kelce brothers' fans, but that's good to see you, as always.All right, Jesse, next.See you tomorrow night.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The radical left Democrats are supporting Nikki Haley for one reason, she's very easy to beat.NIKKI HALEY (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You're not just not as sharp as you used to be.WATTERS: Trump, Haley and the VP race. It's all going down in New Hampshire.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): It seems very difficult when you have 300,000 people showing up encountered. We need a secure border.WATTERS: John Fetterman is recovering and the Democrats hate it.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]DANA WHITE, PRESIDENT, ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP: I don't [bleep] tell any other human being what to say, what to think, and there's no leashes on any of them.WATTERS: The media, UFC, and free speech.Plus --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You see us outside freezing to death. You think we would stand in line like that for Nikki Haley?WATTERS: We are live from the great state of New Hampshire where in less than 24 hours, the polls close, and the people of the Granite State will choose the Republican nominee for president.Already, the party is rallying around one man. Last night, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign, endorsed Donald Trump and attacked Nikki Haley on his way out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear.We can't go back to the old Republican Guard of yesteryear.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: This comes the same week that former candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Tim Scott endorsed the former president.As you know, Donald Trump lives by a Code of Honor. Once you endorse him, the past is the past.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: He said will I be using the name Ron DeSanctimonious? I said that name is officially retired.[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE](END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But before the party can fully unite, one opponent is still standing, Nikki Haley, and it's getting ugly.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: On Tuesday, you can declare that the Republican Party is never going back to the days of a weak establishment candidate.If you want a losing candidate who puts America last, vote for Nikki Haley.HALEY: Chaos follows him, and we can't have a country in disarray and a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. We won't survive it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So Donald Trump is heading into the New Hampshire primary tomorrow night with about an 18-point average lead, and that doesn't even really factor in the DeSantis drop out. DeSantis voters are breaking the Trump over Nikki by about two to one, and now is facing pressure to bow out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HALEY: I've watched the entire media elite yesterday and today say that I should drop out for the good of the country to support Donald Trump.(CROWD say "no.")HALEY: America doesn't do coronations. We believe in choices. We believe in democracy and we believe in freedom.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But not everybody believes Nikki Haley is going about this the right way. She was confronted by veterans over the weekend. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think it's responsible for politicians who to spend like $100 million in Iowa on TV ads, which goes to mainly news stations that have lied to us for years, when there's homeless veterans out there that could use that money? When you didn't even come close to beating Trump? And you spent like $100 million in TV ad money?HALEY: Do you know my husband is a veteran.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's fine, but I am just saying.HALEY: He's a combat veteran.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm asking you --HALEY: Do you know that when the media doesn't tell the truth, the whole reason you put commercials on is to tell the truth because the media doesn't.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But my point is, you're not going to beat Trump --HALEY: You know what?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And all the money you're wasting could go to better causes.HALEY: I appreciate that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That would make the Republican Party actually -- that's what I am saying.HALEY: You know what? Last I saw it, it was a democracy.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And some people in Nikki's crowd had other types of proposals.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nikki.HALEY: Yes?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will you marry me?[LAUGHTER]HALEY: Are you going to vote for me?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm voting for Trump.[BOOING]UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get out of here.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Nikki handled both of those situations fine, but that was tough. But that's what New Hampshire politics is, you get face-to-face with voters, and you have to listen to everybody.In another forum, Nikki Haley says she was the victim of racism.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HALEY: We were the only Indian family in our small southern town. I was teased every day for being brown, so anyone that wants to question it can go back and look at what I've said on how hard it was to grow up in the deep south as a brown girl.I know the hardships, the pain that come with racism.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Well, we feel sorry Nikki was discriminated against back then and we'll find out tomorrow night if stories like that will get traction with Republican voters.Now, Trump contends that the Haley campaign is a Democrat flea flicker. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The people behind Nikki are pro-amnesty, you like that? Pro-China pro, open-borders, pro-war, pro-Deep State, and they're pro-Biden.The radical left Democrats are supporting Nikki for a very simple reason, because they know she's easy to beat.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So how much enthusiasm is the Haley campaign generating? Well, we sent a producer to a Nikki Haley event to find out. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FOX NEWS CHANNEL PRODUCER: What makes you most excited to vote for Nikki Haley?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm most excited to vote for her because I think we need somebody younger.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She's a fresh start for our country.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that she is a strong, independent thinker.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wouldn't say I'm excited about her to be honest.FOX NEWS CHANNEL PRODUCER: Why do you prefer Nikki Haley over Donald Trump?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think she's very honest, and I can't say that about him.FOX NEWS CHANNEL PRODUCER: What do you think about the unaffiliated and Democratic voters supporting Nikki Haley?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, people don't like Trump. I mean, I understand -- I understand that. So she's going to get a lot of support from people who don't like Trump.FOX NEWS CHANNEL PRODUCER: If the election does come down to a rematch between Trump and Biden, who would you vote for?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Trump. One hundred percent.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would feel forced, as I felt four years ago to vote for Biden.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Well, If we learned anything from Iowa, a majority of the base wants a total upheaval in Washington. I'm not sure Haley voters are sending the same message. But it was early and maybe they hadn't had the coffee.Now, last night, Trump hosted a big rally in Rochester, New Hampshire and here is his message.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Your vote in this primary is your personal chance to score the ultimate victory over the liars, cheaters, and frauds trying to destroy America.We're going to have a whole different country. As soon as I lift my hand from the Bible as your 47th president, I will seal the border, shut down the invasion of millions and millions of people coming into our country, and we will start an energy revolution.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And Johnny begged me to let him go to the Trump rally and in order to just to shut him up, we got him a ticket. Here's what he found out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: When you think of President Trump, what's the first thing that comes to your mind?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Winning.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Power.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My celebrity crush.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is our first rockstar superhero president?TRUMP: And by the way, I didn't have to bring JLo or Jay-Z.BELISARIO: What issues are getting you out to vote?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've got to shut that border down. We don't know who's coming over.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want to be energy independence again.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am sick of the Green New Deal hoax.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Get rid of all of the woke ideology in the schools.

Good.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]DR. DEBORAH BIRX, FORMER CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: A little low grade fever.TRUMP: Uh-oh.BELISARIO: Everybody is talking about four more years. What does four more years mean to you?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Heaven. Compared to this, heaven.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Unity within the American people.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Getting our lives back.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want 40 more years.BELISARIO: So you want Trump forever?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You will never find anybody like President Trump for many thousand years.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]TRUMP: You're right.BELISARIO: What was your favorite part of Trump's first term?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No new wars.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who other president has merch?BELISARIO: Well, Joe Biden is selling socks.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yay. Everyone loves to wear socks.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Stocks are great. Money in the bank.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Give me the money.BELISARIO: The governor of this state endorsed Nikki Haley.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's just a total RINO.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a betrayal.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's his last name?BELISARIO: Sununu?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. And no good.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]BIDEN: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.BELISARIO: What do you think of Nikki Haley?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's really important that we unite as Republicans.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everything that I've learned about her, I just think she's kind of crooked.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You see us outside freezing to death. Do you think we would stand in line like that for Nikki Haley?[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]HALEY: It's unsettling, right?BELISARIO: Ron DeSantis dropped out and endorsed Trump.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Finally, I think that he was just shooting himself in the foot.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]UNIDENTIFIED MALE: See that?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He was smart.BELISARIO: Ron 2028?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If he sticks with Trump and learns from him, that might be good.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What was Ron DeSantis thinking? You can't beat Trump. Nobody can beat Trump.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's a true conservative, but we're always going to remember that you'd betrayed a friend.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): You live and you learn with these people, right?BELISARIO: Trump is going to be looking for a vice presidential pick. Who should he choose?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Vivek Ramaswamy.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: DeSantis.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Kim and Ron DeSantis could be a good teamwork.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]DESANTIS: Stop pussyfooting around.BELISARIO: Tell me about Joe Biden.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's a grandpa.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was rooting for Joe Biden. I want him to do good. It's our country. I don't want him to fail. But he failed.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Got the IQ of a sack of carrots.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]BELISARIO: If you had to look into your heart and say something nice about Joe Biden, what would it be?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can't say anything nice. I can't.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]BIDEN: Name me one. Name me one.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's married to a school teacher.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He likes the same kind ice cream I do.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]BIDEN: By the way, I have a whole refrigerator full upstairs.BELISARIO: Do you know Jesse Watters?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you kidding me? I love Jesse Watters.BELISARIO: What is your favorite part of Jesse's show?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Of course, you. We wait till the end for you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Johnny is good.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is your world, we only live in it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So the message from New Hampshire is clear, Republicans are ready to move on to the general. But one woman wants to say, and if Nikki Haley comes within single digits of Donald Trump here in New Hampshire tomorrow or beats him obviously, she can justify staying in and waging another battle in South Carolina.But South Carolina is a month away, and if Nikki Haley doesn't overperform tomorrow, then she is a braver woman than I thought, because she'll have to withstand a month of tongue lashing from the wickedest trash talker in American politics.Plus, an avalanche of Trump endorsements, pressure campaign from Republican voters to pack it in with grace. You know, for the sake of the party's financial health and muscle tone.The general election is not going to be pretty, and the Republican Party is only going to win when the party is fully supportive of the nominee. Keep the focus like a laser on the threat to the American people, Joe Biden.But who am I to give anybody advice? The decision is yours.Kellyanne Conway is a former counselor to President Trump and a Fox News contributor. She joins me now.Is the Republican primary over?KELLYANNE CONWAY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.WATTERS: How?CONWAY: Donald Trump will be the nominee.Well, the voters don't look at biology or even chemistry. Politics is about math and science. You have to have more delegates than the other person.WATTERS: Are you saying Nikki Haley is not following the science.CONWAY: She's not following the science. Those who follow the science knew enough to mask our five-year-olds, but look, the moderate wing in the party, the establishment for which we're not going back nominating Mitt Romney and John McCain and folks like that, and then they have to choose a vice presidential candidate who's conservative because the base is so upset.Donald Trump doesn't have to worry about any of that. He created this base. He expanded this base.All the articles right now, Jesse talk about him versus Joe Biden and who is expanding or shrinking the relative parties. Joe Biden is losing Hispanics and African-Americans and first time in young voters and Independents and he's losing them to Donald Trump.Trump is really asking or I'm asking the party to do what Trump has been doing since last July, pivoting to a general election strategy and focusing on Joe Biden.DeSantis did a good thing. I think the best decision he made in the last year-and-a-half was dropping out of the race.And --WATTERS: So, Kellyanne Conway is asking the American body politic to pivot to the general election.CONWAY: Unify. Unify.WATTERS: But what happens if all of these rich Wall Street guys keep handing Nikki money?CONWAY: They still are. They still are. And I would tell them you're always focused on things like ESG and Planned Parenthood, this acronym, that acronym -- focus on USA. Get with it because you already know that Joe Biden is raising taxes, increasing regulations to make us energy dependent, killing those Keystone Pipeline jobs, Jesse on day one, and making us dependent on foreign dictators who don't even like this country and our people.WATTERS: So is she staying in for clout? I'm Nikki Haley. I'm going to take this as far as I can go. I'm going to stack up a couple of delegates, so I go into the convention with juice and leverage -- is that the play?CONWAY: Possibly. Juice and leverage, but also she's got a big future. She's in her early 50s. People will have to run again in 2028. Biden or Trump would be at one term.But I think she's misreading the way MAGA looks at everyone else, which is on the one hand, you're attacking Trump; on the other hand, you're trying to attract his voters. She left the administration early.She left in September of 2018. That was a little early. And the reason I say that is just six weeks later was the midterm elections. We could have used her juice and we could have used her out there trying to campaign for this governor and senator.So for the sake of unity, I hope she will use a lot of the goodwill that she has built up to go out there and campaign for the nominee, Donald Trump.And let me say this, when he's stuck in blue city courtrooms, I really hope everyone will be out there picking up the slack.WATTERS: Yes, that's the only way they're going to do it.CONWAY: Eye on the prize, Joe Biden. He deserves our Iowan ire.WATTERS: It's the only way. All right, use your juice wisely. That's what we learned this evening.CONWAY: And Wall Street, these guys, you know, give the money back. You're going to benefit so much from a second Trump term. Get on the right list, the one that's helping USA. That's the acronym they should think about, USA.WATTERS: All right, Kellyanne Conway.CONWAY: Thank you.WATTERS: KAC, other acronym that I can't forget. Thank you.Well, PRIMETIME thinks we know who Trump's VP will be. Straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: As we said at the top, once Vivek and DeSantis dropped out, Republican voters have been gossiping about Trump's VP pick.I told my staff we're getting way ahead of ourselves here, but it's what everyone's talking about. So we're going to give the people what they want.Politicians are already being asked about it. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Vivek, do you want to be vice president?VIVEK RAMASWAMY (R), FORMER 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, look, I want to serve this country in whatever way I can, Jesse. But that's why I've been in this race since first place.SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH): Certainly, if the president asked, I would have to think about it because I want to help them however I can.SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): The only thing I want is four more years of Donald Trump and a Republican majority in the Senate, a majority in the House and the White House.And if I can help achieve that through my endorsement by being on the campaign trail in my home state of South Carolina for the next four or five weeks, and then beyond, that's the goal.REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): I'm not getting into any conversation with President Trump. But I've said for over a year, I'd be honored to serve this administration in any capacity.GOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R-AR): Look, I absolutely love the job I have. I think it's one of the best jobs I could ever ask for and I am honored to serve as governor and I hope I get to do it for the next seven years.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So these are just some of the candidates whose names have popped up. Let's analyze.Vivek is a sharp populist with youth on his side. Also an interesting name for bumper sticker. Trump-Ramaswamy.You have Senator JD Vance in Ohio, ideologically attuned with Trump, young- ish, showed he could win a state. Smart, little drama.Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina got engaged this weekend. A VP with a wife is definitely better than a VP without one. Would Scott pull in more of the Black vote? Not sure.Elise Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman out of New York, kind of shifted from establishment to populists, blew up the Harvard president and is obviously enjoying her audition.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Arkansas Governor and as you know, former press secretary, you know, she can talk the talk.Other names we hear being bandied about? Kristi Noem, the telegenic South Dakota governor; Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake, certainly charismatic.We're even hearing about Katie Britt, Alabama senator, who my producers told me denied her invitation to join our show, twice, which now makes me think she doesn't like me, which would make her a terrible VP choice.National press secretary for the Trump campaign, Karoline Leavitt joins us now.Now there's a secret name, Caroline, that I'm going to reveal later, which I'm being told is in the running, but where is the president when it comes to picking the VP?KAROLINE LEAVITT, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: Well, as the president said yesterday, he has about 25 percent towards one person. That's not a lot, Jesse, okay.WATTERS: Twenty-five percent.LEAVITT: We are very much focused on winning the New Hampshire primary tomorrow and then focusing our attention to taking the fight to Joe Biden. Hopefully, if Nikki Haley decides to realize she has no pathway to the nomination and this race and will drop out.I don't know. Genuinely, I don't know.WATTERS: So, you don't know.LEAVITT: I don't know if the president even knows. I think he's still thinking about it genuinely looking over all of the candidates.I will say this.WATTERS: Yes.LEAVITT: He did tell Fox News' very own Bret Baier yesterday that the most important quality for him is someone who he knows will make a great president after he's out of office. I think that's very important.WATTERS: Okay, that's interesting. We're having Kari Lake on later in the show. Are you saying she is in the running?LEAVITT: I am saying everyone's in the running.WATTERS: Everyone is in the running. I am in the running.LEAVITT: You could be.WATTERS: I can't take the pickup. I heard a secret name. Kellyanne Conway just brought it to our attention. Marco Rubio for VP.Now I hadn't even seen his name. I'm on the list anywhere but then when I thought about it I thought, that's interesting.WATTERS: Well, I will say this. The Republican Party has a very deep bench. Marco Rubio endorsed the former president of the United States, Donald Trump as well as Senator Rick Scott before Ron DeSantis even dropped out of this race showing the power President Trump has from the great state of Florida, and tonight here in New Hampshire, President Trump will be joined by Vivek Ramaswamy. Governor Doug Burgum, Senator Tim Scott, all members of Team Trump. So we will have to see.WATTERS: All right, and are we -- are you hearing what we're hearing that Tim Scott got engaged because he thought he might be tapped for VP? Is that true?LEAVITT: I think Tim Scott got engaged because he's a great man.WATTERS: All right. He's in love. It's true love everybody.Karoline, thank you.LEAVITT: Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Well, the Democrats used to love Fetterman, but now he is recovering and it's a major problem.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Today, the US Supreme Court issued a decision we can't understand. In a five-four split decision, the court ruled the Biden administration can begin cutting down Greg Abbott's border fence in Texas.Greg Abbott had thrown up razor wire to prevent illegals from crossing into his state and the White House argued that the razor wire was preventing them from doing their job, which apparently was letting illegals in.And the conservative justices dissented, but Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett sided with the liberal justices and said Biden could cut the border wire.Now since the federal government has the authority to enforce border policy, the court found that the federal government is within its rights to not enforce border policy. They have discretion.Governor Abbott said this isn't over.But what good is the federal government if it can't defend our border? That's almost the entire point of the federal government. And our state's supposed to defend themselves if the federal government won't. Illegal immigrants are now issuing threats when they cross. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIGRANT MALE: If you are smart enough, you would know who I am. But soon, you're going to know who I am. Very soon.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow. Very easy. The entitlement. The entitlement.MIGRANT MALE: No. believe me. I'm much better than that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The entitlement guys, wow.MIGRANT MALE: You will see soon.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: When a Middle Eastern migrant breaks into our country and tells us you're going to know who I am pretty soon, that's the reason you leave up the razor wire. But Democrats are now letting child sex offenders into the country and then letting them walk free after they're arrested.An illegal alien from Honduras was charged with child sex abuse, and a sanctuary city in Virginia just let him out of jail. He violated a teen this summer and videotaped it and a judge just let him out and kept ICE in the dark.Thank God ICE just caught him, but the migrant didn't go down without a fight. He punched an ICE agent in the face during the takedown and then cut another charge. But are you ready? Binder is blaming Republicans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: They released an illegal immigrant from Honduras who was charged with sexually assaulting a Virginia minor. Doesn't that go to show that as record numbers of people appear at the border, you guys have no idea what kind of people are coming into this country.KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We need more resources, we need more funding, which is why we're having these negotiations on the Hill, but Republicans in the Senate is working with us, Republicans in the House are trying to get in the way.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: I'm sorry. I hate to be a stickler, but Republicans in the Senate is working with us? Republicans in the Senate is working with us?My God. Here's a better answer, Binder. How about before you blame Republicans who have nothing to do with our border policy, you say? I'm so sorry for the Virginia teen who was brutally raped by a man who was in the country illegally.How about you start with, I'm deeply troubled and saddened by this horrific sex crime committed on an American minor by a foreign national. That's what a normal person says when they hear about a crime like that.Now, Republicans in the House aren't getting in the way of anything. But there's one Democrat who understands the issue, Senator Fetterman, who is recovering nicely and no one is more excited about that than PRIMETIME.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FETTERMAN: I honestly don't understand why it's controversial to say we need a secure border. You can be very supportive of immigration, but we also need to have a secure border.And I really -- I think about immigration is we want to provide the American Dream for any migrant, but it seems very difficult when you have 300,000 people showing up.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The Democrats loved Fetterman when he was speaking gibberish. They said he was Churchillian and possibly the next president of the United States.His chief-of-staff was calling the shots, his wife was speaking on his behalf. Everything was great.But Fetterman regained his ability to speak, and started making so much sense that the Democrats have a problem. The Democrats can't have a straight talking senator with common sense. No one will know they're Democrats.Straight talking common sense politicians don't last long. They get chewed up and spit out. Democrats can only tell the truth in secret.So we're worried about Fetterman. If he keeps telling the truth, Biden is going to indict him.Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake joins me now.So Fetterman really, he got better quickly. That's not going to be good for the Democrats.KARI LAKE (R), FORMER ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I don't know what medicine they gave him to wake him up. But you know, he's starting to make a little more sense. I agree with what he said, part of it. But the part of the American Dream with offering that to people coming across the border.Right now Americans are having a hard time, Jesse, living the American Dream. And I think we need to start putting Americans first.It is just -- it's astounding that the Biden administration is using every ounce of their energy to fight to allow this invasion on the border. They're obviously ignoring the Constitution, the Guarantee Clause, and now suing Texas, taking it all the way to the Supreme Court, so that hundreds of thousands of people can invade our border every single month, so that fentanyl can pour across and kill our young people, so that crime can skyrocket on our streets in our cities and communities and they do nothing to take that on.WATTERS: I mean, crimes everywhere. They are raping children and videotaping it, and Democrats are letting them out of jail. I mean, what is the point of that, Kari?LAKE: It's unconscionable. And then when you see what they're working on in the US Senate, these three senators including my opponent, Kyrsten Sinema, I call it the Sinema-Schumer bill because it's just outrageous. They want to give all these people work permits, allow them to stay in our country.And you see what's happening at our -- if you've been at an airport lately, it looks like a migrant encampment. It's outrageous.The American people are fed up and that's why frankly, I'm here in New Hampshire, they're showing up in droves at President Trump rallies and they are going to show up tomorrow.WATTERS: They have REI sleeping bags which cost about a hundred fifty-two hundred dollars, no idea where they get those things.Kari, your name was mentioned a couple segments back as a possible VP contender. Have you given that any consideration? Is that something that you might enjoy doing?LAKE: Well, I'm running for US Senate. I see myself in the Senate and helping America, and helping secure our border, and helping make Arizona a safer and better place to live in the US Senate.I'm here in New Hampshire right now helping President Trump and I really want to get him back in office. But I think that we need to make sure that not only do we take back the White House, but we've got to have the majority in the Senate and that majority runs right through Arizona.If we don't have the majority in the Senate, can you imagine how hard it's going to be for President Trump to get things done and this outrageous ruling by the Supreme Court just proves, we need a law to build the wall and secure the border.We need a law to finally stop people from pouring across our border and destroying our country and that is what I'm willing and able to do. And starting on day one, I'm going to help President Trump do that.WATTERS: Did you even bring a parka? Because do you even own a parka if you're from Arizona. You must be freezing up here, Kari Lake. Good luck.LAKE: I do. I do have one and it's sitting very close to me and I can't wait to put it back on.WATTERS: All right, stay warm. Thanks so much.LAKE: Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Well, the UFC is now under assault. We'll tell you what's going on.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: The UFC had a big fight in Toronto over the weekend and the Canadian sports press, it is about the same as the American sports press. You know, instead of asking about the sport they ask about social justice.One reporter asked Sean Strickland about transgenders in the pre-fight press conference. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: You've got a pretty supportive gay and lesbian community in this city. I did want to ask you about something you wrote a couple of years ago. You said, if I had a gay son, I would think, I'd --SEAN STRICKLAND, AMERICAN MIXED MARTIAL ARTIST: Oh, another -- another of these I am saying to you, a swampy guy. He is a swamp.Because you're a weak [bleep] man, dude. You're like, you're part of the [bleep] problem. You elected Justin Trudeau like what [bleep] you when he seized the bank accounts, like you're just [bleep] pathetic.Everything that is wrong with the world is because of [bleep] and the best thing is, is the world is not buying it. The world is not buying your [bleep] peddling.This guy is the [bleep] enemy. You want to look at the [bleep] enemy to our world. It's that [bleep] right there.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now Sean's a fighter without a filter and that drives the media crazy, because if you don't respect the speech police, you don't respect them at all and that's all these sniveling pretend journalists care about, the status they hold.Their job becomes useless because the only power they have over us is the power we give them.Now the crowd in Canada, not fans of the prime minister. They were chanting "F Trudeau" all night long. We can't show it. We wanted to, but we can't.The Strickland fight came down to the decision on the cards and it was controversial. I admit, I didn't see the fight. But there could have been some home cooking. Dana White said he might have won.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WHITE: I had it two to two going into the last round, and I thought Strickland won the last round.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But the media isn't there for the fight. They were there to fight for the transgender rights and they begged Dana White to censor his fighters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: You obviously give a long leash to your fighters about you know what they can say when they are up there with a UFC microphone, and you are getting into territory of homophobia, transphobia like is there --WHITE: I don't give anybody a leash.REPORTER: Well, I'm saying you --WHITE: A leash?REPORTER: I'm --WHITE: Like free speech? To control what people say? I am going to tell people what to believe. I'm going to tell people -- I don't [bleep] tell any other human being what to say, what to think and there's no leashes on any of them.What is your question?REPORTER: I was asking that question. I'll move on though.WHITE: Yes, probably a good idea.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Pete Hegseth, the co-host of "Fox and Friends" Weekend, the host of "Poison Ivy" on Fox Nation.PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Amazing.WATTERS: I mean, that was just great.I mean, it's funny that he would expect censorship because there's censorship everywhere, I guess, the UFC is the place where it doesn't exist.HEGSETH: It doesn't. UFC in the United States is one thing. The UFC in Canada is a whole another, right? They don't have the same First Amendment protections there.WATTERS: No.HEGSETH: They're happy to censor speech. Everything is politically correct, and then the UFC shows up, which is basically like permanent locker room talk. Okay.WATTERS: Right.HEGSETH: This guy talks like the guys I served with in the infantry, right? They make better arguments than anybody else, but none of it could ever go on TV.WATTERS: I know.HEGSETH: And it all makes sense, and everyone listening, I mean, guy is wearing a shirt that says, "A woman in every kitchen and a gun in every hand."WATTERS: I didn't even see that.HEGSETH: Do you think he was going to say? Nothing? He's saying we'll be politically correct. You don't have to agree with everything you said. I am sure Dana White doesn't.But standing firmly behind the idea that you should be allowed to say it is quintessentially American at a time where it's freedom speech, oh, except for misinformation; freedom of speech, except for misgendering; freedom speech except for the latest hate speech.They are not playing that game.WATTERS: Pete, why do these sports journalists ask about transgender rights?HEGSETH: Because it's gotcha. It's gotcha.They want clickbait. See Will talk about this a lot.WATTERS: Right.HEGSETH: A lot of sports reporters actually hate the sports they cover.WATTERS: They do?HEGSETH: They do. And so they want to find a wedge to get at these athletes who are smarter than them and faster than them and bigger than them and have hotter girlfriends than they do.And so they're angry about it and so they try to ask gotcha questions and to throw them under the bus.WATTERS: It's like me, I hate the politicians that I cover. It is the same thing.HEGSETH: Same deal.WATTERS: But I'm not jealous of it.HEGSETH: But they want a clickbait headline to make the UFC look like this bigoted whatever it is.These are guys that are savages that fight in the ring.WATTERS: Right.HEGSETH: What do you expect them to be? Polite?WATTERS: Yes, you don't ask about transgender rights to these guys.HEGSETH: It's good First Amendment.WATTERS: Because they know the answer is going to be pretty bad.HEGSETH: It is good First Amendment and it's good business. What are you going to do? Try to control these guys?WATTERS: All right.HEGSETH: I mean, you can't.WATTERS: The Sean Strickland of Fox News. Pete Hegseth, telling it like it is. Thank you so much.HEGSETH: Thanks. Good to see you.WATTERS: The media just pulled the old switcheroo. Andrew Yang in PRIMETIME.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Now, Trump's on track to be the Republican nominee and his chances of a second term, improving every day that the party coalesces behind him. That means Democrats and the media need a Plan D.Impeachments indictments and ballot stripping, not working. So now they're just going to institutionalize them.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ABC NEWS GUEST: Donald Trump is truly confused about who Nikki Haley is, thinks somehow that she was in charge of security at the Capitol on January 6, clearly confusing her with Nancy Pelosi.JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: Joe Biden. Joe Biden is doing just fine. We're talking about the fact that time and time and time again, Donald Trump who is obviously as Ron DeSantis said lost more than a step and as Nikki Haley says is really, you know really confused up there.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So Trump called Nancy, Nikki and now they're ready to invoke the 25th.But Trump says he is sharper than ever, he took a test to prove it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I did say, what about a cognitive test? He said, well, you know, it's not that easy. I said, well, is it a hard test? It can be hard. I said, look, I've got to take it because I've got to shut it up. And I took it and I aced it.And let me tell you, you know, they always show you the first one like a giraffe, a tiger or this or that, a whale.I guarantee you, Biden couldn't get by number three. I think he'd probably get the whale.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Voters can judge for themselves. Only 28 percent say Biden is mentally fit, 47 percent say the same for Trump. Our very own stupid son of a bitch. Peter Doocy asked Binder about it today. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: Let's see. Karine, why do you think it is that more and more people polled feel like over time, President Biden is getting less and less mentally sharp.JEAN-PIERRE: Which poll is this?DOOCY: ABC has President Biden's rating for health since May down five points and for mental sharpness down four points.JEAN-PIERRE: You know, I have to say that's a little confusing for me.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: I think everything's confusing for Binder.Andrew Yang is a former presidential candidate, and Forward Party co-chair. So Yang, what are you doing here in New Hampshire?ANDREW YANG, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm supporting my guy, Dean Phillips who's trying to upgrade from Joe Biden in the Democratic Party. I'm someone who thinks that we need to move on from the battle of the 80- year-olds.Dean is a spy 55 years old. He plays hockey, CEO of Talenti Gelato. Let's go.WATTERS: You're a Dean guy. Let's go. Let's go. You debated Joe Biden. Have you noticed a difference in his performance?YANG: I haven't been around him personally up close but I've been talking to folks and they've noticed a decline.WATTERS: In what way?YANG: Oh, they say that, you know, he is not as energetic that he sometimes seems to lose concentration and focus. And the fact is, the guy is 81 years old.You know, he would have to be highly unusual not to be experiencing something that's very, very natural. Most Americans want to turn the page from both Biden and Trump, 70 percent of Americans say they'd like to see a different generation take hold in us.WATTERS: Even though Trump said he aced his cognitive tests.'YANG: You know, again, we're talking about two guys who are in their 80s.WATTERS: Well, aced them. He said aced multiple, he didn't think Biden could even get whale.YANG: You know, I'm here saying that neither of these guys is what we need in 2025 to 2028 to actually solve the problems of this era that are getting rougher and more complex all the time, including closing the border or enforcing the border in a way that makes sense to most Americans.WATTERS: So you're just a normal, rational, reasonable problem solver and you find that there is no place for you in the Democratic Party.YANG: Yes. There are a lot of people who are finding the same thing. And that's one reason why so many Independents now we're trying to figure out where they stand.I think Dean Phillips can unify the country because he wants to have a nonpartisan bipartisan Cabinet. He wants to bring people together across party lines, and I personally would love to see it. I'm here for it.WATTERS: All right, he is here for it and he is here for PRIMETIME, his favorite show on Fox News. He didn't tell me that at all. I just made that up.YANG: It's either you guys or Gutfeld. I don't know.WATTERS: Thanks, Yang.Speaking of the UFC, my wife, Emma sent me some photos from earlier this afternoon. It is the progression of a chokehold. There's Jesse Jr. and Gigi in her crib. There's Gigi falling a little closer to Jesse Jr. Now he's starting to wrap the arm around and there's been chokehold.Night, night, Gigi. Time for sleep.Let's do some text messages.Brian from Vancouver, Washington: How are the heated sidewalks in Berlin, New Hampshire working out? I mean, they were only $800,000.00. They're beautiful.Perry from Virginia Beach, Virginia: Trump and Vivek's bumper sticker could be Trumparama.I love it. I've now changed my VP choice.Sarah from New York: How about Fetterman for Trump's VP.Oh. I don't know if that would work. I don't think Fetterman his wife's a fan, if you know what I mean.Jim from Texas: Any sightings of Big Foot Biden?We have not seen any sign of Joe Biden here. Dean hasn't seen it. Yang hasn't seen it, but we'll let you know if there's a sighting.Harry from Marlboro. New Jersey: Johnny is having too much fun at those Trump rallies. You need to rein that boy in.I need to put him on a leash like those Canadian reporters want me to do.I need a leash and stuff. I need a leash and a whip. Johnny is trouble.That's it for us tonight. DVR the show. And always remember, I'm Watters and this is my world.
