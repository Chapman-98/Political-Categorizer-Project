It is a lie.WATTERS: Fani and the Lover Boy in the hotseat. The Trump-Georgia case falls apart.("60 MINUTES" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They spied on my campaign. They spied on my campaign.LESLEY STAHL, "60 MINUTES" CORRESPONDENT: There is no real evidence of that.TRUMP: Of course there is. It's all over the place.STAHL: No.WATTERS: Obama and the CIA caught cooking the books. Brand-new bombshells.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)DANTE KING, AUTHOR: Whites are psychopaths. There is no discussion about the delusion and the perversion of Whiteness.WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday.Plus --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Happy Valentine's Day.WATTERS: Merry Christmas. I know it is February, Happy Black History Month, but today, we were given a gift, a gift we didn't expect, but a gift we deserved.The woman responsible for Donald Trump's mugshot appeared in a Georgia courtroom today for a hearing about whether she should be disqualified.Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis who is charging Trump with election interference hired her lover to prosecute the case, paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars, which he used to take her on romantic vacations, foreign and domestic, and didn't disclose the relationship to anyone and didn't report any of the gifts he gave her at all.When Fani and her lover, Nathan Wade were caught, they both lied to the court about whether the relationship started saying they started sleeping together after she hired him, and also claimed Fani paid Wade back for all of the trips.But right at the hearing began, their entire defense blew up when an eyewitness, Fani's long-time friend and employee testified under oath that she saw Fani and Wade going at it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you observe them do things that are common among people having a romantic relationship?ROBIN BRYANT YEARTIE, FANI WILLIS' FORMER FRIEND: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Such as? Can you give us an example?YEARTIE: Hugging, kissing. Just affection.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All before November 1st of 2021, correct?YEARTIE: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That alone is grounds for Fani's qualification and destroys the Trump-Georgia case for at least two years.So Fani and Wade's lie didn't even last until lunch, but as the hearing went on, we witnessed a hilarious display of some of the most preposterous lies and behavior that have ever been displayed in Fulton County.Fani's Lover Boy took the stand and immediately got Alzheimer's.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you go to a cabin with Miss Willis ever?NATHAN WADE, FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA PROSECUTOR: Ever?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ever.(Long pause)WADE: No.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You have never gone to a cabin with Miss Willis?WADE: No.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So Lover Boy got off to a slow start and then he admitted he was going over to Fani's condo all the time before she hired him, but not for sex, for documents.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Isn't it true that you would go to Miss Willis' house in South Fulton County occasionally?WADE: I have never gone to her house in South Fulton County.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You've never gone to her house in South Fulton County?WADE: I have never seen her house.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You've never gone to a condo in either East Point or Hapeville area with Miss Willis?WADE: That's different. I have gone to a condo in Hapeville.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You would you have been there as you indicated for many reasons, right?WADE: Yes. Yes, she resided there. I went to visit her. Maybe went to talk about a document that I received.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You would go to the condo and talk about a document that you received?WADE: Absolutely.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Were any of the other attorneys visiting Fani's condo? Reviewing documents? No, just Wade.After Fani paid 700 grand to prosecute Trump, Fani and Wade traveled the world together. How did they pay for these romantic trips together? Wade put it on his corporate card, but don't worry, Fani paid him back, they say in more ways than one. Their story is, Fani reimbursed her lover with cash.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You said in the affidavit that you roughly shared travel, though, correct?WADE: Yes, ma'am.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Okay. So this roughly sharing travel. You're saying she reimbursed you?WADE: She did.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And where did you deposit the money she reimbursed you?WADE: It was cash. She didn't give me any cheques.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And so all of the vacations that she took, she paid you cash for?WADE: Yes, ma'am.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And you purchased all of these vacations on your business credit card, correct?WADE: Yes, ma'am.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Cash. How convenient.Now, I've met a lot of businessmen over the course of my career and I have never encountered anybody who puts all of their romantic vacations on their corporate card and has their boss who they are sleeping with pay them back in cash and then deduct it as a business expense on their taxes.But Wade is a different breed. Wade says his law practice is mostly a cash business.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WADE: She was very emphatic and adamant about this independent strongwoman thing, so she demanded that she pay her own way.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you know the source of the cash?WADE: Just that, out of her pocketbook.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't know where she obtained the cash?WADE: I didn't ask her.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the whole time that she was paying you in cash, you never said, hey, why do you have this amount of cash?WADE: Mr. Sadat (ph), in my practice, people come into my law firm all the time with cash. I never question where they got it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So the lawyer who is allegedly saving democracy by prosecuting a former president, an unprecedented case in the history of the United States, is a personal injury attorney who runs a law practice where clients regularly walk into his office with briefcases of cash, and he doesn't ask any questions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you go to the atm with her?WADE: No, sir. She didn't go to the ATM. She carried the cash.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So she would give you the cash. Do you have a little place in your house where you just stack up all this cash that you apparently got to repay you for these benefits that you bestowed on her?WADE: Mr. Gillum (ph), if I answered that, I'm putting myself in jeopardy. If I tell the world that I have cash some place in my home, don't you think that could be problematic?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: All right, so, who in the world would tell the world that they have cash at their house? More on that later.Now, after Wade had been totally discredited, Fani's attorneys tried to prevent Fani from being called as a witness, when out of nowhere, Fani rumbles into the courtroom in hot pink and demands to take the stand.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And then suddenly, these changes, she files her financial declarations --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you meet with Mr. Wade and talk to him about the motion that I filed to disqualify you?WILLIS: On January? This first January motion?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.WILLIS: I don't know if you could say talked about, I probably had some choice words about some of the things that you said that were dishonest within this motion. So I don't know that it would be a conversation as you know Mr. Wade is a southern gentleman. Me not so much.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Oh, for the next two hours, Fani was a hot mess, flailing and filibustering.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIS: I'm not on trial no matter how hard you try to put me on trial. I'm not a hostile witness. I very much want to be --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not so much that you're hostile, Ms. Willis. It'd be an adverse witness. Your interests are opposed to Miss Merchant's.WILLIS: Miss Merchant's interests are contrary to democracy, You're Honor, not to mine.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Has he ever visited you at the place where you laid your head?WILLIS: Well, let's be clear because you lied in this -- let me tell you which one you lied in, right here -- I think you lied right here.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I am going to --WILLIS: No, no, no, this is the truth.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Judge --WILLIS: It is a lie. It is a lie.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now, after the judge admonished everybody, Fani admitted, she and Wade had been dining out together for years before she hired him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIS: Maybe I went to his office once or twice, but maybe once.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the purpose for going to his office would have been what?WILLIS: Maybe we would have went to Mellow Mushrooms for pizza or maybe he would have come for lunch. I'm sure we went by each other's office though, but not often, not a lot. We were both grinding.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Oh, grinding, but they went to more than just Mellow Mushrooms. They went to Latin America, the Caribbean, and this was the part of the testimony where Fani was able to exhibit her intellectual credentials, now, enough credentials that you would you expect the DA prosecuting the former president to have.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You also said that he was a world traveler and been on many of the continents.WILLIS: Had been to six.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you been to any of those continents with him besides this one?WILLIS: Where is Belize? What continue is that? I'm not being funny, I don't know.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'd say with the exception of the --WILLIS: I've been to Belize with him. I've been to the Bahamas with him. I have been to Aruba with him.Don't embarrass me, I'm not sure what continents those are on. Whatever continents those are, that's where I've been on.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Okay, Aruba is in South America, Belize is in North America. She sounds like she's on the streets being quizzed by Johnny. They also went to Napa together. All of these trips going on his Wade's business card. So what is Fani paying for?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIS: I paid for a bunch of stuff. I think we did two different wine tours that you do, which are pretty expensive. I think I bought him -- he likes wine. I don't really like wine to be honest with you. I like Gray Goose.I bought him a bottle of wine while we were there and the sipping that you do. There were pear champagne, chocolate, and -- champagne, chocolate and caviar -- it was the three and it was like three different things -- Sweden, Russia, someplace else, I'll make that up, but that was the most expensive thing.That trip did not cost me a lot of money. I might have took like $750.00 in cash on me because we weren't gone very long.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The Fulton County DA is eating caviar in Napa while she is prosecuting President Trump and her boyfriend paid for the flights with taxpayer money.Where did Fani get all the cash from anyway?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIS: I always have cash at the house. That's been -- I don't know, all my life. If you're a woman and you go on a date with a man, you better have $200.00 in your pocket so if that man acts up, you can go where you want to go.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Where did that cash originally come from if it didn't come out of the bank?WILLIS: I had cash -- cash is fungible. I've had cash for years in my house.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The money that you paid Mr. Wade, the cash in October 2022, you do not know where that money came from?WILLIS: I do know where it came from. It came from my sweat and tears.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So the top law enforcement officer in Fulton County, Georgia just announced to the world that she keeps stacks of cash at her house and she carries wads of cash with her to Belize wherever that is. So Fani proved she's not street smart or book smart and can't show any ATM withdrawals to prove where she got the cash to pay back Wade.Wade testified that he went to Fani's condo to look at documents. Is that true? What else happened?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIS: Yes, I'm sure, he came to visit. He came to visit. I can remember us going, I think the restaurant is Lickity Split. I can remember him picking me up, going to Lickity Split and eating, ordering some food and coming in and sitting at my table and eating, so I remember times that he visited me at the condo.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Yes, Lickity Split. Got to love that place. Rum raisin, rainbow sprinkles, the best. Now, at this point, the media had seen enough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHUCK ROSENBERG, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: This is getting ugly, it's getting messy and my guess is it not going to get better.CAROLINE POLISI, DEFENSE ATTORNEY SPECIALIZING IN WHITE COLLAR CRIME AND A LAW LECTURER AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: It's about lying to the court. It's about potential financial gain on the part of Fani Willis.The issue is that her credibility is shot. It's a horrible, horrible look for her. I think this case is dead in the water.Fani Willis lied to the court. It's game over for her. She will be disqualified.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Probably a bad idea to have two sleazy lying lovers waste taxpayer money on romantic vacations while prosecuting the president, and then concoct the most unbelievable cover up in Georgia history.But what do you expect with when the jury forewoman was a giggly wiccan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: What would your reaction be if the DA decides against bringing any charges after what you have seen?EMILY KOHR, GEORGIA GRAND JURY FOREPERSON: I would be sad if nothing happens. I will be frustrated if nothing happens.BOLDUAN: If it was just a surgery charge.KOHR: I will be happy as long as something happens.(Giggles)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: These cartoon characters don't have the pedigree to be in the same courtroom as the former president. But remember, this isn't the Fani and Lover Boy scandal. It is a Biden scandal.The Lover Boy, Fani, Alvin Bragg, Jack Smith's team and New York Attorney General Letitia James have all been meeting with Biden's White House counsel, Biden's Justice Department or with Kamala Harris.The Biden White House is overseeing the prosecution of his political rival, but just like everything Biden oversees, it is falling apart.Let's bring in Judge Jeanine Pirro.How do you think today went for Fani Willis?JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CO-HOST, "THE FIVE": I have to tell you that she was, without a doubt, the most confrontational, combative, nonresponsive, defiant, condescending, arrogant witness I have ever seen in a courtroom, especially in a courtroom, and not be taken away in the county bus and held in contempt at the local jail.I mean, this just does not happen in courtrooms. She walks in and she literally is so angry, she accuses the lawyer right off the bat of lying in her questions, with her sworn affidavits and the judge doesn't say anything. I mean, the judge just lets her -- she was out of control.She says that this lawyer is, what is it? Contrary to democracy, everything she's doing. Meanwhile, you look at Wade, this guy is sweating bullets. He knows he doesn't have any evidence on his side. He knows his claim of getting cash as reimbursement is ridiculous.And by the way, if this guy ever tries a case against President Trump, President Trump want to have two drinks -- and he doesn't drink though, and be happy.This guy drank water all for hours, I kept thinking, when is he going to the bathroom? I mean, all he did was drink water.WATTERS: You have been in the legal world for a long time. How familiar are you with the idea of just cash everywhere?PIRRO: Let me tell you, the first thing that is going to come out of this case is the IRS now has a target on Wade's back because he says, yes, my clients come in all the time and they pay me cash and she comes up with cash. Nobody has got -- nobody is taking money out. Nobody is depositing money. Nobody is going to an ATM. They are just oh -- we should believe them. We should believe them.Meanwhile, a woman who was her best friend says, yes, they were basically sleeping together in 2019. But the woman came in, tried to control the courtroom and here's my concern, Jesse.WATTERS: What?PIRRO: The judge acted like a wimp. This judge should have been offended right off the bat when she tried to run the courtroom. She ran it. He did not.WATTERS: Why did he pander to her so much?PIRRO: I don't know. All I can think of is, I did a little background. He's just been appointed a judge. So, he is a new judge, he doesn't know the ropes yet, but he is running for re-election in four months.WATTERS: Ah.PIRRO: So, he doesn't want to tee her off. He doesn't want to tee off the community.WATTERS: Judge, you remember when the guy .PIRRO: But in the end --WATTERS: . was in court, I think it was Nevada, and he just jumped up at the --PIRRO: Yes, that guy.WATTERS: I thought Fani was going to do that at one point.PIRRO: Well, I think she might have, I mean, had she gotten angry enough. I have never seen a witness this out of control and then lecture the judge, point her finger at the judge and lecture to the attorneys. This woman potentially holds the fate of the nation in her hands as a prosecutor against the former president. This is crazy time.WATTERS: Usually you don't want to announce you keep lots of cash in your house when you're a public official.PIRRO: Yes.WATTERS: Is that something you probably leaned against doing when you were running things?PIRRO: For sure. And by the way, when I was a DA, the chances of me taking six vacations in five months are slim to none. What DA has that kind of time?WATTERS: Prosecuting Trump is hard work. You've got to blow off some steam.PIRRO: Yes, well, that's why she hired him. This guy can't try a felony case, I am telling you right now.WATTERS: Okay, Judge Pirro doesn't keep any cash in her house at all.PIRRO: None.WATTERS: Thank you the very much.A bombshell about the Russia hoax that we've never heard before.Plus, Johnny celebrates Valentine's day.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Who is your Valentine?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My mom. You kind of gave me a sad look. I was expecting that to be cute and you'd be like, "ah."(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Fox News Alert: Part three of the investigation into how the CIA framed Trump just dropped and it changes everything.This week, we learned how Obama's CIA told foreign spies to bump 26 Trump campaign associates who the CIA thought were easy marks. Framing them for collusion and then triggering the FBI investigation, the illegal wiretapping and eventually the Mueller probe.We also learned there are classified documents that prove all of this. That Trump might have copies of, and it could be why Biden raided Mar-a-Lago.Now, today, Michael Shellenberger and Matt Taibbi dropped another bombshell. Russia didn't want Trump to win in 2016. Russia wanted Hillary to win and the CIA knew it.Russia saw Hillary as manageable and predictable. They were comfortable with her and wanted her to be president. The Russians thought Trump was a wild card, didn't want to deal with that.There was never any evidence showing Putin supporting Trump. Obama's CIA director, John Brennan knew this and manufactured the evidence.He manipulated other assessments, buried high quality intelligence and then manufactured a conclusion that 17 agencies agreed Russia interfered in the 2016 elections to help Trump and then the press ran with it and the country was brainwashed.Now, according to these new reports, these were similar tactics the CIA used with the WMDs. This has severely wounded our body politic, warped our minds and wrecked our trust in national security institutions.We deserve the full accounting of this hoax immediately, every document involved.Thankfully, Matt Taibbi and Michael Shellenberger have made great progress and Mike joins us now.Mike, tell us what this new cooking the books situation really is all about?MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER, AUTHOR, "APOCALYPSE NEVER": Sure, Jesse, it is good to be with you.Well, I think some people wonder if this is old news or maybe if this has been reported, I want to assure you that it has not been reported until now. I can also assure you there are current members of the House Intelligence Committee that are unaware of a 50-page report that the CIA is currently hiding at its headquarters.There may be other copies elsewhere, but there is a top secret copy at the CIA proving without a doubt according to our sources, which are multiple credible sources that Russia, in fact, favored Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump in 2016, that they used the Steele memo, the infamous political document commissioned by the Hillary Clinton campaign to create -- to cook the intelligence, as they said, for the early January 2017 intelligence community assessment claiming that the Russians favored Trump falsely. That relied on the Steele memo.That 50-page report continues to exist. It likely exists with the other intelligence information including potentially raw intelligence documents showing that the evidence was very strongly on the side, the best evidence, was on the side that the Russians favored Clinton for the continuity and stability, that they were concerned about Trump for being erratic, and being an unknown quantity, and that the quality of the evidence that contradicted that was much lower, and that Brennan's people manipulated the sourcing, so to speak, the quality ranking given to the sources to come up with really the opposite outcome of what the truth was.WATTERS: So, the election has just happened, Hillary has lost. It was a surprise. They had already kind of had this CIA-FBI deal working, and then they needed some major assessment that was authoritative and you're saying Brennan at the CIA just started going like this and moving everything around to create this impression that they interfered on behalf of Trump?SHELLENBERGER: Yes, that's right.There are actually two separate intelligence scandals here for people to keep in mind. The first one happened earlier in 2016, where our sources, multiple sources, tell us that Brennan oversaw manipulation of our foreign allies to basically entrap Trump associates to create the pretext for the FBI investigation of Trump's alleged collusion with Russia, which we now know is debunked.The second thing is, almost a year later, Brennan orchestrates a phony intelligence assessment that comes to the opposite conclusion of what their own raw intelligence, their best intelligence was showing. These are two massive, massive intelligence scandals, what we're witnessing is the political corruption of both intelligence gathering and intelligence analysis by John Brennan.And these documents, we've been told by multiple people, still exist. They are at the CIA. They need to be released. They are probably part of this larger binder which may have the other documents to support both the evidence of both of these scandals.WATTERS: How do we hold Brennan accountable?SHELLENBERGER: Congress has to take action. I mean, as I said, I now know for a fact there are members of the House Intelligence Committee whose job it is, whose constitutional requirement it is to oversee the CIA, to demand that the CIA be a nonpolitical institution.They need to hold them to account. There need to be hearings on this. They need to get to the bottom of that. We need the 50-page report and the binder and the rest of the documents.WATTERS: Well, I agree. I'm not relying on Congress to do much of anything these days. I do like the CIA interfering in other people's elections, just not ours. That's a line we can never cross.Shellenberger, thank you so much and thanks to you, Matt Taibbi as well. Tell him, thank you.So we were right. The Russia space nuke story turned out to be another hoax.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Yesterday, the American people were taken for a wild ride by Washington insiders threatening word wide Armageddon. The media was spoon fed a leak by the government and they have spent the last 36 hours whipping us into a frenzy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VLADIMIR DUTHIERS, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: The House Intelligence Committee chair warns of a new threat that could involve Russia putting weapons in space.ABC NEWS ANCHOR: Nuclear threat from space. A top house lawmaker sounds the alarm on a serious national security threat.NBC NEWS ANCHOR: The US facing a national security threat over Russia's plan to put nuclear weapons in space.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: It turns out we were right. There were no space nukes. There was no danger. It was a false alarm to approve more Ukraine spending.And while the congressman who cried space nuke is a Republican, it felt like the White House's fingerprints were on this. And wouldn't you know it? We were right again.Congressman Mike Turner now admitting he worked with the Biden administration to craft the language of his first statement that demanded the Biden administration declassify this serious national security threat to the country.But wait a second, the White House told "The Times" they were furious about Turner's disclosure. But it turns out they were working together the whole time.After sending the people into a mass panic, the White House spent today on cleanup duty trying to assure us they are not, in fact, about to be blasted to kingdom come by the Ruskies.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANTONY BLINKEN, US SECRETARY OF STATE: This is not an active capability, but it is a potential one that we're taking very, very seriously.ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: This is not an active capability that's been deployed and though Russia's pursuit of this particular capability is troubling, there is no immediate threat to anyone's safety.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: It was a ruse. All week DC knew Kamala was going to Munich to pledge our support for Ukraine, so the Senate passed their $60 billion Ukraine bill Tuesday morning and within hours, Speaker Mike Johnson said the House wouldn't vote on it and what do you know? The very next day, the sky was falling and Russia was to blame.Now, this isn't the first time Washington has tried to deceive us like this, but usually they are better at it. Here's Kirby still going.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KIRBY: Nothing is more important to President Biden than the safety and security of the American people, that's his top priority and it is going to remains front and center as we continue to determine the best next steps.Now, I could just briefly -- I want to share a few words about the battlefield situation in Ukraine.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: All right, he is like a time share salesman. He gets you in the door with the threat of thermo-nuclear war but once inside he convinces you to spend all your money on an Eastern European country you'll probably visit only once.Now, I know at this point, we expect our government to lie to us all the time, but they have got to do better than this.Worldstrat president, Jim Hanson joins us now. Jim, not their best effort. What happened?JIM HANSON, ARMY SPECIAL FORCES VETERAN AND CHIEF EDITOR AT MIDDLE EAST FORUM: They were lying and doing it badly. That's the embarrassing thing. I don't want to bust anybody's bubble, Jesse but the Russians have 6,000 nukes already right down here on good old Planet Earth. If they ever decide to cause trouble with them, they don't need to and if they want to nuke some satellites, they can just shoot one of their ICBMs up there, create an electromagnetic pulse and shut down everybody's satellites and a good chunk of the electronics down here below it.This was a joke. It was like the other -- old Russian space nukes, and then they were like, oh, help us, Obi Wan Biden, you're the only one. You know, it was pathetic.WATTERS: Now, it makes me think the whole Washington game is completely orchestrated. Mike Turner is a Republican. He's on the House Intel. He's the chair and he is putting out this like scary statement. The Biden team must declassify the urgent threat from Russia.He let the Biden White House review the release before he sent it.HANSON: You know, there is a bizarre collection of people all obsessed with Ukraine, and it revolves around Trump is the weird thing.You've got neo-cons who Trump is ruining their forever war game and then you've got leftists who is hate him for just being Trump, but Putin is a stand-in for Trump and they are all obsessed with Ukraine and sending them all our money now.And here's an interesting little tidbit. Mike Turner's district covers Wright Patterson Air Force Base. There is a little thing there called the National Air and Space Intelligence Center. You think they are going to get some money out of this scare?WATTERS: Oh, God.HANSON: Yes.WATTERS: Just when I thought it was about politics, it turns out, again, like usual, it's about the money.HANSON: You know it.All right, Jim, thanks, as always.HANSON: Always a pleasure.WATTERS: It is DEI Thursday, America.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: We will be doing this on a weekly basis.
