JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: And that's it for us tonight. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro in for a Laura Ingraham.Catch me weekdays co-hosting "THE FIVE" at 5:00 PM Eastern. Also, check me out on Instagram @Judge_Jeanine.Thanks for watching the Special Edition of "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE."Jesse Watters is next.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --FANI WILLIS, FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY: I don't do my friends like that, so if you tell me it is a G, then you're going to get a thousand dollars.WATTERS: Day 2 in the Fani Willis hearing, meet Fani's daddy.JOHN FLOYD III, FANI WILLIS' FATHER: It's a Black thing, okay.DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a corrupt judge who ruled against me before he got the case.WATTERS: Judge Nudy's filthy ruling against the Trump Organization.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's kind of late, ain't it?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A little too late.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are citizens, we are not the politics. We are people.WATTERS: Finally, Biden visits East Palestine.Plus --RIC FLAIR, PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER: Major boy, Jesse Watters. Wooh.WATTERS: Fox News Alert: A judge in New York is ordering Donald Trump to pay over $350 million in fines and banning the former president from running a business in the state of New York for the next three years.This case was decided by a single judge, Judge Engoron, a strange guy, but not as strange as these charges. They were brought by New York attorney general, Letitia James who campaigned on fighting Trump, not crime.Remember, Letitia James visited the Biden White House three times. The woman brought a case that according to the Associated Press has never been brought in the history of the state.This statute was written to criminalize phony salesmen, swindling folks out of their homes, or fake doctors selling bogus therapies. Crimes with clear victims and damages. In this case, there were no victims or damages, not a single bank or Trump customer ever complained. Everyone made money and Trump paid hundreds of millions in taxes and employed thousands of people.Letitia James said Trump's penthouse was not as big as he said it was, and Mar-a-Lago was only $18 million. And Judge Nudy, we call him that because he takes nude gym selfies agreed and slapped the Trump Organization with a killer penalty, even though an appellate court ruled that three-quarters of this case had passed the statute of limitations.Now legal experts say Trump will easily win on appeal, but that's not the point. This is a financial assassination attempt of a political target. The judge is also placing an observer inside the Trump organization, in other words a mole for the next three years to blow the whistle if he sees any fraud or if he notices the marble floors are too shiny. Now if Trump wins re-election, expect them all to declare fraud.Letitia James, who is supposed to be a neutral administrator of justice spewed venom. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LETITIA JAMES, NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL: Donald Trump may have authored the art of the deal, but he perfected the art of the steal.The scale and the scope of Donald Trump's fraud is staggering, and so too is his ego.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Here is Donald Trump's reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: This is Russia, this is China, this is the same game. It all comes out of the DOJ. It all comes out of Biden.It's a witch hunt against his political opponent. These are radical left Democrats. They are lunatics and its election interference.If I weren't running, none of this stuff would have ever happened. None of these lawsuits would've ever happen. Nothing would --I would have had a nice life, but I enjoy this life for a different reason, we are going to make America great again.These are corrupt people. These are people that should not be allowed to do the things they do. And they are using this as weaponization against a political opponent who is up a lot in the polls.It's all headed up by Biden who is destroying our country. So, this is Russia, this is China, this is what you've been reading about all your lives and it is happening right here in our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Meanwhile, it is Day 2 of the trial of the century, Fani Willis and Lover Boy.Fani was supposed to take the stand today, but she didn't show up because it was impossible to dig yourself into a deeper hole, instead she sent her daddy, John Floyd III, a former Black Panther, of course.We heard yesterday, Fani paid Wade back in cash for the romantic trips, but had no proof. Fani's daddy says, it's a black thing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did she say anything to you about having a large savings of cash?FLOYD: Oh, no, she -- oh, no. See, maybe -- excuse me, and Your Honor, I'm not trying to be racist, okay, but it's a Black thing, okay?You know, I was trained and most Black folks, they hide cash, or they keep cash, and I was -- you know, I was trained, you always keep some cash.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Did Fani's daddy know about the Lover Boy? He said he heard about them on the news like the rest of us. The last boyfriend, Fani's daddy knew about was DJ Deuce.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FLOYD: She had a boyfriend when I first got there --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And did you meet her boyfriend?FLOYD: Yes, I met him often.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And did you know him by any specific nickname?FLOYD: Yes. Deuce. He would do weddings and so forth and so on. He was a disc jockey, he played music. So he owned -- all of his stuff was always in the way and I was always having to try to push it aside.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Wait a second, if Fani was dating DJ Deuce, but Fani's friend said she was dating Lover Boy, was Fani two-timing Lover Boy and Deuce?Like everything in Fulton County, it's complicated. When Fani moved out of the house her dad was living in, did her daddy know where she moved to?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FLOYD: No, and I did not want to know. I intentionally did not want to know, because I was not -- you know, if somebody stuck a gun to my head and I could tell them, I wasn't going to tell them anyway. I would have made up something, but I did not want to know.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So Fani's daddy does not know where his daughter lives in case a kidnapper puts a gun to his head and demands her whereabouts? Fani's daddy doesn't know where his daughter lives or who she dates, well, what does he know?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FLOYD: Before COVID was even here in the United States, remember, I had lived in South Africa and I have traveled the world. I knew COVID was coming before. I knew COVID was around before.They may have announced it in '20, but in fact I knew about it, and I knew what was happening in '19.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So Fani's daddy knew COVID was coming before Fauci and did warn us? Bad daddy.Later, Fani's daddy pulled a magnifying glass out to look at documents like he was Sherlock Holmes. It was quite the performance.Fani and daddy have a lot in common. Both actors, both insist cash as a Black thing, but isn't that the point?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIS: I don't do my friends like that, so if you tell me it's a G, then you're going to get a thousand dollars. Whatever it is, I did not ever make him produce receipts to me.For his 50th birthday, I considered that I took him to Belize and I took him to Belize because -- now, I don't want to discuss his personal business, but I am happy Mr. Wade is still here with us, and I did 50 big, very big.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That $4,000.00 is part of your, my words, "cash hoard" that you had collected over time.WILLIS: Cash what?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hoard. H-O-R-D-E.WILLIS: I thought you said something different, sir.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I am afraid, I wouldn't say that under any circumstances -- to you or anyone.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right, back on track.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The hoard, cash hoard.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now logical Americans saw Fani brag about eating caviar, lying about her boyfriend, playing the race card, yelling at the judge, and thinks that women should be disqualified.But the media, they think Fani is hot.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: This idea that women of color have to sit there and be demure and take it, there were people on social media who were saying, oh, she is coming in too hot. No, she wasn't.MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: I thought she was fiery. I thought you said important things. I think that she set herself up for a lot of criticism, but I think this is a woman who does not give a damn about that.SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": They don't have a case against her. I think this is certainly just a political move.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Founder of Outkick, Clay Travis joins me right now.Clay, you know, Fani wasn't hot enough.CLAY TRAVIS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Jesse, the woman began her testimony yesterday by saying that being questioned about hiring her lover, paying him $650,000.00 in taxpayer money was an attack on democracy.Now look, I am not an expert in all aspects of democratic governments, but I don't think back in the day Benjamin Franklin and George Washington and the founders were sitting around in Philadelphia like, you know what? We better be careful, because 250 years from now, if somebody hires their lover and gives them tons of money, the entire republic may collapse.I loved everything about this testimony, Jesse. My favorite part is this: You probably have taken a woman to a nice resort. She went to Belize, she went to Aruba, she went to the Bahamas, she probably took -- I was talking about this on the radio, eight bathing suits, right? Women pick eight different bathing suits, you and me, we've got one suit. We've got no idea.WATTERS: Right.TRAVIS: Can you imagine as you sit there sipping your Mai Tai or your fruity drink with the umbrella in it, can you imagine turning to the lovely lady that you are with on that trip and saying, hey, babe, I'm going to need you to give me two grand in cash when we get back to the room to cover your half? No.You're sitting there like this is the best money I've ever spent in my life. I've got a woman with me on the beach hanging out by the pool, having a few cocktails.Everything she said is crazy. My favorite part, Jesse. I love the Atlanta Braves.WATTERS: Yes.TRAVIS: I love going down and watching the games with my friends, with my kids. She said -- that Nathan Wade said that they left Atlanta, drove to Tennessee, had lunch and turned around and drove back and nobody even asked about that.I have done that drive a ton. That's like six hours to go eat lunch in Tennessee. I want to know what was really going on. That must've been the greatest launch of all time.WATTERS: Well, that was when they might've gone to a cabin, remember, have you ever taken Fani to a cabin?TRAVIS: And said, I rent a lots of cabins. He sounded like Ron Burgundy when he said that. I rent lots of cabins. I'm a regular cabin renter.I mean, this, I couldn't -- you can't make up the lines that were getting dropped. Boom, boom, boom. It was hard to even keep track.WATTERS: What happens with this Nudy ruling? We call him Nudy. He takes naked gym bathroom selfies.TRAVIS: Yes.WATTERS: We now have a financial assassination attempt on the leading Republican candidate. He is beating Joe Biden and they are trying to bankrupt the guy with financial shenanigans with cases that have never been brought in the history of the state. How is this being allowed?TRAVIS: No, you are right.Look, I actually think that this is an incredible week for Trump because it confirms everything that he has been saying.Fani Willis and Nathan Wade are going to be off the case in Atlanta. This is me as a lawyer, there's a zero percent chance that anyone with a functional brain can say that what they are involved in is permissible. The Atlanta case is dead and done and buried.On the 350-plus million, look, Jesse, I thought you nailed it in your open. This is what I said. The goal here is to try to make Trump put forward -- now what is it? $430 million some odd dollars in cash, even super rich people do not have those kind of assets.They are trying to bankrupt him They are trying to embarrass him. These will both, in my opinion, be overturned on appeal. It is why, and I tweeted this, Jesse, I know that you are in New York right now, I live in the great state of Tennessee. I am talking to you from the great state of Florida.I will never live in a blue state for the rest of my life. I will never found nor incorporate or be involved in owning any company in New York, because here is the truth, if Trump had lived in Florida his entire life, the E. Jean Carroll suit does not happen, the Alvin Bragg felony charges do not happen, and this Judge Nudy $350 million plus by Letitia James does not happen.He is being prosecuted, railroaded, and attacked because he has gall, the audacity, and the temerity to be a Republican running from New York and a Republican running from New York who is about to kick Joe Biden's ass and send them Joe back to Rehoboth Beach if not his own jail cell.WATTERS: But the entire New York media establishment is dying for these cases to be brought. You had Stephen Colbert who is supposed to do a late night comedy show. He looked like he was about to cry. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN COLBERT, "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT" HOST: I know, I know how numb we have become, but it's not normal -- no other candidate for the presidency has ever had to pause his campaign and defend himself in multiple courts.And I would like to point out that in all seven of his cases, no one, no one doubts that he did these things. We are just sitting around patiently waiting to find out if the wheels of justice will grind fast enough for there to be any consequences, and the media is covering it like it's any other political story, like it's all horse race.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: I mean, you turn on the TV, you want to watch someone like Johnny Carson and it's Liz Warren screaming at you, way too close to the lens.TRAVIS: Look, I am going to say, I am someone Stephen Colbert, and I believe Donald Trump legitimately as a lawyer is innocent of all seven of those cases that you just laid out either not culpable from a civil context or innocent on a guilty or innocent aspect.And Jesse, you and I are around the same age. I've obviously got a way better jacket on than you do tonight, because my friend Barbara sold this to me and said you're going to look better than Jesse again, so thanks to her but --WATTERS: You look similar to Jesse.TRAVIS: You and I grew up --WATTERS: Similar.TRAVIS: We grew up .WATTERS: Which is an improvement.TRAVIS: . watching David Letterman, I bet.WATTERS: Yes.TRAVIS: I bet you, you used to watch David Letterman.WATTERS: Yes.TRAVIS: And you used to think, my God, that guy has the coolest job that anybody could ever have. I would like to be somewhat like him one day. If you watch television, everybody around our age did. Does anyone on the planet want to be like Stephen Colbert?He has destroyed late-night television. He has turned into political propaganda and worst of all, he is not remotely funny.Jesse, you would do a better job, I would do a better job. Greg Gutfeld is smoking his ass and it is not even close. I guess, I could thank him for helping Fox News a bajillion dollars on Gutfeld's show by making him the king of late night.WATTERS: I just want to think the woman that gave you that nicely tailored jacket. Congratulations. You've finally grown up, Clay.You look great. Now go out to the restaurants and enjoy yourself.TRAVIS: I appreciate. That's the plan.Have a great weekend. Keep up the good work.WATTERS: You, too.So Joe Biden is rounding up FBI informants and whistleblowers and having them arrested. Straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Remember the FBI informant that said that Ukraine bribed the Bidens, Joe and Hunter five million apiece. Biden's Justice Department just arrested him.Special Counsel David Weiss, the Delaware prosecutor who you remembered try to cut his sweetheart deal to keep Hunter out of prison announced charges against Alexander Smirnov. Smirnov is a trusted and credible informant that the FBI has had on the payroll for years, even Democrats said the FBI informant was credible.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): There is a confidential human source that the FBI works with who is proven to be very credible who reported a conversation with someone else.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But he was too credible, the Biden administration is charging the FBI informant with obstruction and making a false statement.Remember, he informed the FBI that there were audio recordings of Joe Biden and Hunter shaking down a Ukrainian CEO for bribes, and coincidentally, after arresting the FBI informant who fingered him for bribes, Biden says it's time to drop the impeachment inquiry.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: An FBI informant at the center of the impeachment inquiry into you has been indicted for allegedly lying. Your reaction to that and should the inquiry be dropped?JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He is lying, and it should not be dropped, and it's just been -- it's been an outrageous effort from the beginning.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now, as long as we are arresting FBI informants for making false statements, why isn't curveball behind bars? This was the Iraqi informant who told the intel agencies that Saddam definitely had WMDs. We went to war in Iraq, then curveball confessed he made up the story and walks around a free man.When are we going to arrest Christopher Steele, the FBI informant who said that Trump colluded with Russia? He is still a free man.So why is the Biden administration arresting this FBI informant now? The FBI has had this four years ago and then Republicans discovered that it was covered up so Biden is locking up the source to discredit it?This is the second informant Biden has arrested for blowing the whistle about his bribes. An Israeli-American citizen told the FBI about the Chinese money going to the Bidens in 2019 even before they had the laptop. He has been arrested.Remember Patrick Ho, the spy chief of China who lined the Bidens' pockets, he was arrested. Remember Devon Archer, Hunter's business partner? He's been arrested.Everyone who blows the whistle on the Biden syndicate or is connected to it has been arrested. What does that tell you?Former FBI agent, Stuart Kaplan joins us now.Stuart, what does that tell you?STUART KAPLAN, FORMER FBI AGENT: Well, it's certainly not a time for the FBI to take a victory lap. It's shameful, it's embarrassing, and it's not a time at all for the Bidens to take a victory lap.Jesse, when that 1023 form was released last year, my colleagues and I knew at that point that informant was going to be sacrificed. It was just a matter of time.That informant has been on the books since 2010, 2011, 2012, up until more recently. You do not stay on the books with the FBI unless you have been vetted and you are credible, and the fact that he had received so much money from the FBI and so many people have to sign off on that payment or those payments, it has to be verified that he is a very productive informant.So what the FBI and our government wants to have us believe now is we have now taken out the predicate -- the predicator -- the person who started the ball rolling, you know, tattling or telling on the Bidens and now, we gathered all of this other information, all of the money trail, all of the cheques, all of the payments, but yet because we are going to discredit the guy who unleashed on him, let's throw it all in the garbage like it never even happened.So let's assume we eliminate this guy. We still have a treasure trove of evidence that leads directly from Hunter Biden to his father. It's just insane. It's illogical.It really is embarrassing. I can't believe that the FBI has gone down this road again to unleash on this informant.WATTERS: Take the morality out of it, Stuart. Joe Biden is a smooth operator.He got away with his family taking a lot of money over many, many years and everybody that gets close, Trump even got too close, gets arrested -- informants, business partners, whistleblowers, they are all paying a price, but the Biden family has never paid a price. You have got to hand it to the Big Guy, he is getting away with it.KAPLAN: He has gotten away with it for years and years and years, and that's because he has something over these other people. It's tit-for-tat.I mean, the FBI has a treasure trove of evidence, the IRS has a treasure trove of evidence against the Bidens, and listen, I give them credit. They took out a hit on this informant, Smirnov. They have now disabled him, and now, the public is going to believe, well, this guy is a liar.WATTERS: Right.KAPLAN: And so now everything falls by the wayside. And by the way, Jesse, you realize that they are alleging that he lied in September of 2023 about things he said in 2016. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous, because you have to understand the way things work. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, he was vetted.The information he provided was corroborated, that's what got the ball rolling with respect to the FBI and the IRS. It's not like his information is the only thing that's out there against the Bidens. There's a treasure trove of information.WATTERS: All right, Stuart, that's why we have you on. You are the best. Go enjoy your weekend.KAPLAN: My pleasure. Have a nice weekend, Jesse.WATTERS: Joe Biden went to East Palestine, finally.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: It's been over a year since a toxic train wrecked East Palestine, Ohio. PRIMETIME talked to a lot of residents who all told us the same thing, someone needs to come here and help us out ASAP.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would encourage people to come here and see what we are living in. It's disastrous.We can smell it. We can taste it. It's in our house. It's horrible.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We get smells all the time. They will just pop up and then sometimes, they are really toxic smelling, chemical smelling, sometimes it's a burnt smell.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is ground zero right behind. This is where I live.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The town was in trouble, creeks were bubbling turning the colors of rainbows. People were getting sick, getting rashes.The White House told America, East Palestine was top of mind for the president and that he would get there immediately.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: The president said over the long weekend that he hasn't had the occasion to go to East Palestine. I just haven't been able to break.The derailment was on February 3rd. President Biden has not had a break since February 3rd?KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president will go to East Palestine. He promised that he would and he will.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Then a year went by and nothing happened. But don't you worry, Biden finally visited, and there were some hurt feelings.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(PEOPLE CHANTING "LET'S GO BRANDON.")UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's the message to Biden right there.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Like how can they turn a blind eye when our kids are still having unexplained nosebleeds, when they are starting to have seizures When we have to tuck kids into beds in homes that have not been tested.We are citizens, we are not politics, we are people.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Usually, American presidents arrive instantly as part of the healing and support process, but not only was Biden a year late. When he finally showed up, he could barely deliver.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I want to thank the folks of East Palestine to know -- I want them to understand that we're not going home, no matter what, until this job is done.And I want to -- we continue to hold Norfolk Southern accountable and make sure they make your community whole now and in the future. And what they do not make whole, what they cannot make whole, what isn't made -- the government will make whole.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now, has the White House pushed Congress to clean up Norfolk Southern? The company who train wrecked the town No, the railroad legislation has died in Congress, while at the same time, Norfolk Southern has spent two million bucks on lobbying.Maybe if we just say the railroads are racist, Mayor Pete will come and fix it.Amy and Kevin Dettmar were residents of East Palestine until they were forced to move, they join us now.So you two are not there right now. When do you plan on returning?KEVIN DETTMAR , FORMER RESIDENT OF EAST PALESTINE, OHIO: Never.WATTERS: Never. Why not?KEVIN DETTMAR: Because I don't believe anything anybody says.WATTERS: Tell us about your home. What state is it in right now?KEVIN DETTMAR: You can't even go in our home for five or 10 minutes, your eyes start burning, your throat starts getting scratchy.WATTERS: Well, they said everything was being taken care of, people are drinking the water, the president is there. They are congratulating themselves. You're saying that's not true?KEVIN DETTMAR: No, that's not true. No.WATTERS: Is there any effort being made to bring you guys back or take care of the house and the land?KEVIN DETTMAR: No. No, we are stuck in limbo right now. We are still paying taxes on our house. Yes, it's just been a sham.AMY DETTMAR, FORMER EAST PALESTINE, OHIO RESIDENT: And we still have to pay her a rent to live in a temporary house.WATTERS: Amy, take us through from the very beginning what happened? They had the train accident. Everything was devastated.You are now a year later still not moved back in. What is that story like?AMY DETTMAR: It's horrific. All of our items that were special to us are all stuck in our house, and we can't go back because it's filled with toxins, and so we have had to leave all of our special items in a house full of toxins and we can't go back to the house.WATTERS: I'm so sorry. What would you say to the president right now?AMY DETTMAR: Please, please, please help us. We are just people. We are not politicians, and we need help to get out.WATTERS: Kevin, what would you like to see the president do?KEVIN DETTMAR: I would like this to be categorized as a disaster, because it was a disaster. When I went down those steps and I looked out the window, and all I saw was this huge inferno, and it was spreading, and it was getting higher, it was probably close to 50-foot in the air, and it started catching trees on fire and I just did not know how far it was going to go.And I knew it was a hot fire, and I knew that there could be embers in the air, and if those were to come down, it could've been a domino effect.As far as the president, I certainly disagree that it took him a year to come to East Palestine, and for everything that the government has done for Ukraine and everybody else, but nothing for the residents of East Palestine, nothing as far as the government is concerned.WATTERS: Kevin, I'm so sorry. Amy, I am so sorry. My heart goes out to you guys. We are pulling for you. We really hope things get better and the president gets it into gear and Congress does too and holds Norfolk Southern accountable. We will continue to stay on the story and we will be in touch with you guys too, as well. Thank you guys very much.AMY DETTMAR: Thank you.KEVIN DETTMAR: All right, thank you.WATTERS: More PRIMETIME ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Election day is less than nine months away. In 2020, seventy percent of people either voted by mail or before election day. There might not be lockdowns this time, but mail-in voting will still be a huge factor.Eight states are mailing ballots to every registered voter on the rolls, even if they did not ask for one. It's a harvesters dream. Ballots will be floating around the street. The floors, the garbage, the mailboxes, Wandas and Craigs will be rummaging everywhere and intimidating you if you don't hand it over.The voter rolls are a mess, too. Johnny's grandma and great grandma should not be getting ballots in the mail. Sadly they died years ago.In Michigan, a conservative group is suing the state claiming there is 26,000 dead people on the voter rolls. Michigan mailed every registered voter a ballot application in 2020, that's over seven million people.The Secretary of State tried to get the case thrown out, Biden judge denied them. We will keep you updated, but is Michigan going to sending ballots to dead people?Meanwhile, Wanda the Stuffer, still walking the streets in Bridgeport, and Craig who between stuffing ballots and moonlighting for the FBI is out in Atlantic City.Johnny just talked to him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Craig, but you know that's not right?CRAIG CALLAWAY, DEMOCRAT OPERATIVE AND FORMER ATLANTIC CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT: What's not right?BELISARIO: Rigging elections. Using fraudulent ballots. People say you have --CALLAWAY: I have no comment. I would appreciate it if you get -- move away from me. Get out of my face. So I don't have to lay one of these bastards down.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: PRIMETIME is going to keep covering voter fraud and sloppy elections until every real vote is counted and every stuffer is behind bars. If you have a tip, text us #Fraud.Mail-ins are here to stay. It is written in the law. Democrats have embraced it, they will abuse it to win. Republicans need to fight fire with fire, legally of course. The only way to win is beating Democrats at their mail-in game. Once you're in power, secure the elections, no more drop boxes, no more mass mail outs, and cameras at every single vote counting station.For years, Joe Biden has fancied himself as the Ric Flair of Washington. He loved to talk the talk.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Corn Pop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys, and so he is up on the board, wouldn't listen, I said, hey, Esther, you, off the board or I'll come up and drag you off.You may cut me, man, but I am going to wrap this chain around her head.You're full of (bleep). Give me a break, man. Don't be such a horse's ass.You're a damn liar, man. If you want to check on my shape on, let's do pushups together, man. Let's run. Let's do whatever you want to do.If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But recently, he is finding it harder to walk the walk. Here he is, strolling over to Marine One this afternoon, not really sure what he is doing there. It is a new move apparently.Usually, he does the fake little jog thing to make it look like he is hustling, we are not sure.But his own Department of Justice says he is an old man with a bad memory. And today, he froze behind the podium in an address made to tear into Trump and Putin. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: . he'd encourage Russia to, quote, "Do whatever the hell they want." I guess I should say -- I should clear my mind here a little bit, and not say what I'm really thinking.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So he needs some coaching and we think we know just the guy to help him get his mojo back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FLAIR: Look at us all day, we can go styling and profiling.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And the Nature Boy himself, Ric Flair joins us now.All right, Nature Boy, they are saying Joe Biden needs to show he has what it takes if he wants to win re-election. Any advice?FLAIR: No, but I totally agree, we need someone strong that will just say hey, kiss my ass. I run the United States, and we stand tall.WATTERS: Are you announcing that you are running for president right now?FLAIR: No, but I should've run for governor in 2001, but you know what they told me, I had too many skeletons in the closet. Can you imagine that?WATTERS: Oh, God.FLAIR: If I ran for president now, I would make Trump look like a baby.WATTERS: That's hard to do. Oh, boy.FLAIR: But I mean, I will be 75 next weekend. I have got Adam Wilkes, I've got Ric Flair Drip which is just going phenomenally. Energy will be, I think potentially the largest selling energy drink in the next two years. I'm just blessed today, and my friends like Bo that I work with, and I stay out of the politics.But you really -- you really can't go anywhere -- my saying has always been I am not going to discuss politics or women in a bar. You know what I mean? I will talk sports, but I'm not going to get into an argument in politics or religion.
