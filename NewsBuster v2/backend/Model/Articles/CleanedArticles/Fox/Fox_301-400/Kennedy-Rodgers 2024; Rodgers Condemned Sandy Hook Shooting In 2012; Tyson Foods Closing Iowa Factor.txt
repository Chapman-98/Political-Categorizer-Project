I've cut back on eating because I literally cannot afford food.I don't need much to be happy. I just wouldn't be able to live comfortable.WATTERS: Bidenomics making girls cry.Plus --BECKY: Joe Biden, please let me dance on TikTok. I'm begging you.WATTERS: From pumping iron on Venice Beach to signing bills in Sacramento, the story of Arnold Schwarzenegger may be one of the greatest political stories in American history. A guy with a thick Austrian accent who became famous for having bigger biceps than my head went from Mr. Olympia to Hollywood, playing half man-half robot and just printing money at the box office. Arnold was underestimated his whole life, but especially when he ran for governor of California.He didn't have the political chops, but he was a star who spoke from the heart.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, FORMER CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR: Everything that I got was because of California. I came here with nothing. If I would have gone to any other country in the world, I will still have nothing.This is the place of opportunity. This is the greatest place, the Golden State and now they've run it down. Our economy is spiraling downward. They are witnessing firsthand the American Dream slipping away from them.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Today, there is another star who could be about to make a political splash, a sports star, one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history. Aaron Rodgers, former Green Bay Packers quarterback now with the Jets is having his name tossed around as a potential VP, not Trump's VP. Not Biden's VP. RFK, Jr.'s VP.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR. (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I really like Aaron because, you know, our appeal to young people. We're trying to make sure that young people are participating in the political process, that they have hope for America.Aaron Rodgers is battle tested. He's stood up. He's been hammered by the press. He stood up for things that he believed in, and I like that part of his character.He's a critical thinker and I think we need that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: A Kennedy-Rodgers ticket, I could see it on a bumper sticker, the sports world sold on it. They just have one question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GREENBERG: Could you see a world in which Aaron Rodgers is the quarterback of the Jets and actively running for the vice presidency at the same time?CLARK: Hell yes.GREENBERG: Me, too.CLARK: You think Aaron Rodgers ain't going to take the opportunity to show to the rest of the world that he is smarter and better than all of us? He only does it every time he talks.GREENBERG: Just to be honest, I think it's really cool.KIMBERLY MARTIN, HOST: I think it's fun. It think it is awesome.GREENBERG: I think it is really fascinating. Now, a 40-year-old Aaron Rodgers coming off of Achilles surgery, running six days a week for the vice presidency would be the best quarterback the Jets have had in a very long time.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: ESPN loves the Rodgers VP story. Loves it. Automatic ratings, and now they can talk politics without getting in trouble. And remember, a large portion of ESPN's audience, African-American. RFK, Jr. already performing well with them and adding Rodgers to the ticket would help and really hurt Biden.The Jets, boy do they need help. Rodgers blew out his Achilles on the fourth snap of last season. Imagine his return to training camp this summer as RFK, Jr.'s running mate.Now if Kennedy-Rodgers wins the White House and the Jets are in the playoffs, would the Secret Service play a line?What do you think is harder? Debating Kamala or beating the Bills? Well, you probably have to prepare more for the Bills, but Rodgers doesn't even have to campaign he just shows up the practice, throws a few touchdowns on Sunday and answers twice as many questions from reporters.Now, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but RFK, Jr. is making his VP announcement in Oakland, which happens to be Aaron Rodgers' hometown.Who wins Wisconsin if Kennedy has Rodgers? Do Trump or Biden stand a chance? Would Kennedy-Rodgers be playing spoiler or would they be playing to win?Remember, Kennedy-Rodgers just needs 34 percent of the vote, and they're in the White House. Three-way split.Now, I know a bunch of 20 and 30, and even 40-year-old guys who would punch that ticket just for fun. And tonight, the Democratic Party is in panic mode.The word around Washington, Democrats prepare to go to war against third- party candidates. After kicking RFK, Jr. out of the Democratic primaries, the DNC isn't finished with them. They're building a whole team, savvy veterans to suffocate a possible Kennedy-Rodgers run.Behind-the-scenes, there's a Jill Stein hangover. Remember Jill Stein? It cost Hillary in '16 and Jill Stein couldn't even shine these guys shoes or cleats. So the word has gone out and the media has mobilized. Hurt Rodgers before the season even starts.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIMMY KIMMEL, "JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE" HOST: His finalists for vice president include quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, and former governor of Minnesota, Jesse "The Body" Ventura. He is also considering a pair of truck nuts dipped in ivermectin.(LAUGHTER)KIMMEL: Kennedy, he says he's been speaking with Rodgers pretty continuously about this for the past month. Oh, that would be some good decision making right there.Rodgers is still playing football. He's still playing for the Jets. How many losing teams can he be a part of at once?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: All right, Rodgers has huge name ID, a sports hero for millions. He's well-read, articulate, independent-minded, and a gifted trash talker. The Democrats know that and went nuclear.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: CNN has learned that in private conversations, Rodgers has shared wild and unhinged conspiracy theories, in which he claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting was not real, that it was a government inside job.Rodgers falsely claimed to Pamela Brown that there were men in black in the woods by the school, and he asked if she thought that was odd. Brown says that she found the entire encounter disturbing.CNN has also spoken with another person, one who would like to remain anonymous in order to avoid harassment, who had a very similar encounter with Aaron Rodgers saying that Rodgers claimed that "Sandy Hook never happened. All those children never existed. They were all actors."(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: This has to be the dirtiest hoax in history. A CNN anchor overheard Rodgers say that the Sandy Hook shooting was staged at a Kentucky Derby party 12 years ago and decided to report this the day after he was named Kennedy's possible VP? Pam Brown didn't report this when Rodgers was all over the news during COVID? Didn't report it when he was traded to the Jets? Didn't report it when he started dating Danica Patrick?Come on.And the other source is an anonymous source. Who is it? Christopher Steele? That's not journalism. That's like a chop block designed to end a career. But it served its purpose. The whole media reported the hoax.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, "ANDERSON COOPER: 360": CNN has exclusively learned comments he's made in private conversations about the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, not being real.GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Aaron Rodgers, like his friend RFK, Jr. is as well known for his embrace of fringe theories as he is for his day job.GAYLE KING, "KING CHARLES" HOST: I think it's insane and I also think Charles, it's so painful and so hurtful.CHARLES BARKLEY, "KING CHARLES" HOST: You have to be insane to think that.KING: And for the record, Aaron Rodgers declined comment tonight, which also says to me if somebody said that about me, and I hadn't said anything wrong.BARKLEY: Well, I bet he did decline.TAPPER: Well, this is where we are as a nation, we have actually as a subject for debate whether or not a vice presidential prospect thinks a massive shooting actually happened.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Rodgers was on an Ayahuasca retreat we're hearing when the news broke, that he was being considered for VP. And then he had to put out a statement: "As I'm on the record saying in the past, what happened in Sandy Hook was an absolute tragedy. I am not and have never been of the opinion that the events did not take place. Again, I hope that we learn from this and other tragedies to identify the signs that will allow us to prevent unnecessary loss of life. My thoughts and prayers continue to remain with the families affected along with the entire Sandy Hook community."And it's sad that he has to deny that he is a Sandy Hook truther, I mean, this is where we are in America today. They report lies so you denying the lies become the news.Any professional journalist would research Aaron Rodgers before reporting the story, and they'd immediately see he is on tape in 2012 paying respects to the victims.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Aaron Rodgers is getting in on that as well. Today, he shares what he hopes will come from this tragedy.AARON RODGERS, NFL PLAYER: And hopefully we can learn from this and look for the signs more and not ever have something like this happen and keep this on our minds because these are things that affect all of us directly or indirectly, and this needs to be something that we learn from.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: This is just another dirty disinformation campaign to distract from the lifeless Democrat ticket. Never in the history of the United States has a president or vice president visited an abortion clinic. That is until today, when Kamala Harris held a campaign event at a Planned Parenthood in Minnesota, where she said this --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Everyone get ready for the language "uterus."(LAUGHTER)HARRIS: That part of the body needs a lot of medical care from time to time.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And that's the reason why politicians don't campaign at abortion clinics.Joe Biden, on the other hand, flew all the way to Michigan to hold a campaign event and he didn't give a speech, didn't hold a town hall, didn't visit a car plant. Joe Biden hung out on a city council member's porch and wouldn't let the media in.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're going to take a few questions.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, guys.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you so much.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Back into the cars, thank you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Back to the cars. Back to the cars.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, guys.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That's what Biden went to Michigan for and he wouldn't even let the press see it. How is that a campaign stop? What was that? That's all he did today.He flew to Michigan for that. That's all the video we have of the president campaigning today. He went to someone's house and no one knows what he said or why he was even there.Michigan is an interesting swing state because the Republican National Committee just filed a lawsuit demanding they clean up their voter rolls.The lawsuit alleges in most Michigan counties, there are more people registered to vote than people eligible to vote and the Secretary of State they say is refusing to do much about it.So Democrats are maintaining ancient and dirty voter rolls suing to strip Trump off the ballot, so you can't vote for him, suing to keep RFK off the ballot, so you can't vote for him and hitting his potential VP pick with mass shooting hoaxes.How can the Democrats campaign on saving democracy when they are running the largest voter suppression campaign in modern history?Let's talk to nationally syndicated radio host, Dana Loesch.This is ugly, this Rodgers stuff, but I'm not surprised. Are you?DANA LOESCH, RADIO SHOW HOST: No, I'm not, Jesse.You know what it made me think of, it made me think of this old LBJ story back when he was running for office in Texas before he became president and he was going to call his opponent and forgive me a pig fornicator. And one of the guys on his campaign said you can't do that, sir. That's insane and it's also not true.And LBJ's response was, well, that's not the point, son. The point is just to get him to deny it. That's exactly what they just did with Aaron Rodgers with this story.WATTERS: You are so right.LOESCH: And you raised a great point. Why sit on this for 12 years, and then only now just talk about it the day after RFK, Jr. who is not like sweet conservative or anything by any stretch of the word. But why announce it the day after -- bringing this up the day after like, you know, he is being the conjecture about him being a VP pick.It's just -- I mean, it's predictable, but this is what Democrats do to each other. So you can imagine what they're going to do to you.WATTERS: Right. And they've done worse to us. Let's just review the last couple of years.LOESCH: Yes.WATTERS: Dana, how big of a threat would this ticket be? We don't know he's on the ticket. We hear he's on the shortlist. We may even think it's a coincidence that the announcement is in his home town, but what kind of impact would it Kennedy-Rodgers ticket have on Trump and Biden?LOESCH: That's a great question. Because normally, I would say none, I would say maybe, you know, they'd be lucky if they pulled like nine or 10 percentage points away, you know, during a general election, but anything goes now anymore.And I think people are so fed up and tired, they just don't even care. I think that they would be attractive to maybe some of the moderates on the right. I keep seeing people on the right saying that they're reconsidering RFK, Jr. because Trump's on the ballot, and I'm like, how are you defining yourself as a conservative when -- and he seems like a very nice guy, but he's for gun control and he said he would sign such a bill if Congress ever sent one to him as president.But then I look at Joe Biden and there are people who are so just fed up with Joe Biden. They look at somebody like Kennedy as a more sanitized version. He still has that Democrat named cred, but he's a little bit more sanitized than you know, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris who don't even get me started on that aspect.WATTERS: Yes, yes, we don't have enough time for that with Dana. We purposely did not ask Dana about that because we don't have a delay button handy.Dana Loesch, thanks as always for joining JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.LOESCH: Oh, no, I just warn you, I am on for another hour.WATTERS: That's true. We have to pay the bills, like now.LOESCH: Exactly.WATTERS: Joe Biden made a girl cry today.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Perry, Iowa is one of the great American suburbs. Quaint shops on the main boulevard, local produce sections at the grocery store and pristine parks sprinkled throughout the town.It reached a golden era in the 60s and 70s when Tyson Foods opened up its pork factory and revolutionized the town's economy. It is a relatively small town with strong values and a very close knit community.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just think it's a friendly community and if you are willing to put out a little effort, I think everyone makes you feel welcome.REPORTER: Would you consider Perry a good place to grow?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Definitely, definitely I am -- I am really pro Perry.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I like the small town atmosphere. You get to know people. You walk down the street, they say hi to you. If you need help, you know who you can turn to, that kind of thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But Perry, Iowa is about to change drastically and not for the better.This week, Tyson Foods announced that it will be permanently closing its pork factory in Perry, killing around 1,200 jobs in a town of just 8,000 people.So as Perry residents struggle to cope with mass layoffs, Tyson Foods has its eyes on a different class of workers. The company is now offering new jobs to asylum seekers in other states like New York.Bloomberg says Tyson is tracking migrants in a massive database. They scroll through the data like Facebook, you see a worker you like, tap hire. They even had a job fair.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BLOOMBERG HOST: So you were at a Tyson Fair in New York City not so long ago where Tyson was basically making this pitch. What did you observe when you went there?SIMONE FOXMAN, BLOOMBERG REPORTER: They created a database for these new asylum seekers in New York City. So these people would come in, they learn a little bit about the company and for the most part, Tyson had already gone through their various details of their application.So many of them, 17 the day I was there, and then another 70 a couple of weeks later went off to Tennessee to go start their new jobs as Tyson production workers.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Oh, and the jobs come with perks, not just health insurance. Tyson IS also offering lawyers to its illegal alien workers and time off to attend immigration hearings in 2034, of course. They're firing Americans and offering perks to illegals. This was the Democrat plan all along.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): Well, first of all, let's just say we are a nation of immigrants, 460,000 open jobs today.SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Wow.HOCHUL: I have 5,000 farm jobs that I need fill so we can plant the crops.REP. JARED NADLER (D-NY): Vegetables would rot in the ground if it weren't -- if they weren't being picked by many immigrants -- many illegal immigrants.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): You see even in Florida, some of the farmers and the growers saying why are you shipping these immigrants up north? We need them to pick the crops.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: We reached out to Tyson for comment and they said they have a very diverse set of employees and they're proud of it.Ohio senator and author of "Hillbilly Elegy," JD Vance joins us now.I didn't think it was legal, Senator to axe American workers and hire en masse illegal aliens.SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH): Well, it shouldn't be, Jesse and we're certainly going to look into whether we can change that assuming Tyson is operating legally, which we don't even know if they are. We don't know the details of this.All we know, Jesse is that they are firing American workers and hiring illegal aliens to replace them.This is the entire point of illegal immigration and Republicans, we've got to hammer this point home. It reduces the wages of American workers by replacing American citizens with foreign laborers who are willing to work at slave wages. It has been the plan, as you said from the beginning and what this means is the eradication of the American Dream.Every time an American is replaced with an illegal immigrant, it means that an American family loses a good family supporting wage, it means that American companies are literally replacing our own citizens with people who work for slave wages. That is not capitalism or a market economy, Jesse. That is the decimation of the American middle class via illegal immigration and it's happening all over the country.WATTERS: And this poor town is going to get slaughtered. All of those people laid off in such a small town, it's just going to have such a tremendous impact. Are they getting around it legally by saying we're not hiring illegal aliens, we're hiring asylum seekers. Is that how they do it?VANCE: Well, that's one of the ways that they do it, Jesse, and we know that the Biden administration has made it easier to basically pretend that economic migrants are asylum seekers. It's one of the reasons why we have to change our asylum laws in this nation.But Jesse, think about how much of a contrast this presents between the Trump economy and the Biden economy. If you go back to the Trump economy, you had American jobs going to American workers, you had wages rising.Under the Biden economy, you had those American workers getting fired and replaced with foreign labor. This is not an exaggeration. All net job creation, Jesse, you heard me right, 100 percent of net job creation under the Biden administration has gone to the foreign born.So we are taking an economy that produced prosperity for American citizens, and turning it into an economy that produces prosperity for people who probably shouldn't be here in the first place.And I bet you know what Tyson isn't doing, Jesse, I bet they're not drug testing the illegal immigrants who are coming in. I bet they're not asking whether they're bringing fentanyl or drugs into that small town with them.This is the end of the American Dream if we let this stuff happen. We've got to reelect Donald Trump and we've got to get congressional Republicans with some spine to push back against this stuff.WATTERS: Hear, hear. Thanks for speaking out about this and thanks for all your work with East Palestine. We really appreciate that. I know everybody in Ohio does, too.VANCE: Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Well, Johnny talks TikTok.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: This could be your last chance to save TikTok. If Joe Biden is watching tonight, what do you want to tell him?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you get rid of it, you're not going to get any votes from young people, and we're your last hope.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Just like Big Tobacco and Big Sugar have hooked us, Big Tech did too.

I watch your videos on TikTok.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm going to buy your book and I'm going to read it. Very excited. "Get It Together."UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get a haircut, Jesse.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Social media is a huge problem but not for the reasons politicians say. Technology is supposed to improve our lives. Ask yourself, are we better off now that we're glued to our phones? We were told iPads and phones would help kids learn and access information. Does it seem like kids are getting smarter and more well-rounded? No. All it did was get them addicted to screens, and it's crippled a generation.Psychologist Jonathan Haidt says we need to end the child phone addiction before it's too late. A lot of kids were born with a smartphone in their onesies. It's all they know. They grew up online.They don't go outside and play, take risks, fail, get hurt, bond with other kids through a mutual adventure. They just stay inside on their phones, depression and anxiety add up.Kids don't know how to interact face-to-face anymore. Have you seen them? Generation Z spends half as much time hanging out with their friends than older generations.Online, you can block people you don't like. You can't do that in real life. You have to resolve conflicts, argue, make amends. They don't have those skills.This generation makes less friends, works fewer jobs, has less sex, and they don't even want to have kids. Many of them want to quit social media, but they can't. If you're not online, you're not in the club. Everybody else in school has Instagram and TikTok, you need it.So they tap their screen anytime they need a little dopamine hit. Ever tried taking an iPad away from a kid? That reaction is called withdrawal.Phones created the safe space generation. We're being robbed not just of our secrets and data, but of our future. How are these kids going to run companies, start businesses, fuel the workforce, start families? They're terrified of taking risks. They're terrified of talking to people.We're neutering ourselves with these phones and the government is not going to save us.We need to take personal responsibility for what we do and what we let our kids do, because now we know the consequences. It's time to take action.Michael Easter author of "The Comfort Crisis" is here.Michael, you saw some of those, I call them kids, they are in their 20s, apoplectic at the thought of their favorite app being banned. What does that say to you?MICHAEL EASTER, AUTHOR, "THE COMFORT CRISIS": It says that we have a problem. I think that you do see that cell phones lean on the same exact loop that fuels all addiction. Right?It creates this short-term pleasure at the expense of long-term growth. And that's really what addiction is, it's the exact same architecture. So when you take that away, people crave this sort of short term pleasure that they're not getting, but if you can just kind of push through that and get over it, I think people you see people's lives really improve in the long term and that's proven out in many studies in young people where they will give -- they will take phones away from young people. And at first they report, oh my God, I hate this. My life is a mess. This is terrible. But after about a month, their lives improve across the board.WATTERS: So Mike, what happens in 20 years if we don't do that? If everybody gets more and more addicted, and people now in their 20s and 30s are in charge and they've lost creativity. They've lost their spark. They've lost their ability to interface with other human beings. Where does that put America?EASTER: I don't think it will put us anywhere good. I will say that many other countries are having the same problem. So perhaps we have a world that sort of lives vicariously through screens and communicates through screens.I think, overall cell phones, not only are they inserting something bad, but they're also taking us away from many good things like interactions with others, time outside, physical activity.WATTERS: That's right. I was just bouncing on my trampoline with my son all morning and look how happy.EASTER: I love it.WATTERS: My knee hurts, but I'm happy. Mike, thanks so much. Everybody go get Mike's book, "The Comfort Crisis."Now nobody likes a liar and here at PRIMETIME, we see right through them, which is why when Biden in the experts told us inflation was transitory we rolled her eyes. Remember, our eyes don't lie.This week, inflation just went up again. Even Dollar Tree has seen enough, they've shut down a thousand stores, Dollar Tree, and no one else to blame. They're just now the Biden team admitting they blew it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK GENERAL ASSIGNMENT CORRESPONDENT: So in 2021 though, you did say that inflation was transitory. Do you regret saying that now?JANET YELLEN, US TREASURY SECRETARY: I regret saying it was transitory. It has come down. But I think transitory means a few weeks or months to most people.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: No biggie. I just misspoke. But it was a big deal for Becky.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BECKY: This is the first month I won't be able to afford rent. I'm not a rich person. I don't have a lot of stuff. I have basic household necessities.Food prices are too high. I've cut back on eating because I literally cannot afford food. I've cut back on my favorite snacks, cat food, treats. I'm exhausted all the time.I don't need much to be happy. I just want to be able to live comfortable.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Good job, Joe. You made another girl cry.Happy DEI Thursday.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: How do you like working five days a week? Would you rather work four? Because that's what Bernie Sanders is pushing. But in Bernie's plan, you work four days a week, and you still get paid the same as if you work five? Where have I heard this before?Remember, Doreen, the dogwalker?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: How many hours is you know, a solid work day in your ideal society?DOREEN, DOGWALKER: Right. Sure. I mean, I think as much as people want. I mean, I personally work. I have -- I have like 20 to 25-hour work weeks, which I think is fairly good. So I would like less work hours. I think a lot of people --WATTERS: What do you do, Doreen?DOREEN: I'm a dogwalker.WATTERS: A dogwalker. Okay.DOREEN: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Doreen probably loves Bernie's four-day week plan. Actually, that might actually be more work than she's already doing. Anyway, is it a good idea for everybody?Fox Business correspondent Hillary Vaughn confronted Bernie -- Hillary.HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Jesse.Well, Senator Bernie Sanders has a new idea, give everyone a three-day weekend every weekend and still get paid the same turning a 40-hour workweek into a 32-hour workweek with the same paycheck.So we had some questions for the senator about how this would all work and how businesses could afford it. Here's how it went.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VAUGHN: Can I talk to you about the 32-hour workweek? It seems like --SANDERS: You're with whom?VAUGHN: Fox Business.SANDERS: Yes.VAUGHN: It seems like Democrats want businesses to be taxed more --SANDERS: Really?VAUGHN: Pay their workers --SANDERS: Is that what you think?VAUGHN: Pay their workers --SANDERS: I like that you -- excuse me --VAUGHN: I didn't get to ask the question.SANDERS: Okay. Thank you.VAUGHN: Senator --SANDERS: You want to -- hold it. Okay, we held a hearing on a 32-hour workweek because what we have seen is that over the last 50 years, despite a huge increase in worker productivity, almost all of the wealth has gone to the top one percent, while 60 percent of the people living paycheck to paycheck.Many of our people are exhausted. We work longest hours of any people in the industrialized world. I think it's time for shortened workweek.VAUGHN: Can I ask you a question about that? It seems like Democrats want businesses to be taxed more.SANDERS: Really? That's not my assumption.VAUGHN: Pay their workers or lower prices.SANDERS: You know what I would like to see -- I can yell as loud as you.VAUGHN: How are businesses going to survive that? That's the question. How can businesses survive all of those proposals?SANDERS: When Mr. Bezos pays an effective tax rate lower than the average worker, I think we have a real problem on our tax system. I think that billionaires have got to start paying their fair share of taxes.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAUGHN: And Jesse, I wasn't trying to have a shouting match with the senator, I was just trying to complete my question, but after today, I kind of agreed with the Senator that a three-day weekend sounds nice --Jesse.AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: We'll be doing this on a weekly basis. DEI is something we must have.WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday, PRIMETIME's favorite day of the week in honor of Reverend Al Sharpton, we are bringing you the best stories about diversity, equity, and inclusion.Let's start in Elk Grove, California, where parents caught wind of the secret pride club for their elementary school kids. Parents say a teacher came to their fourth, fifth and sixth graders, pitching them on an after school club where boys could crush on boys and girls could crush on girls. It seems like something parents might want to know about, but for some reason the school never told them the club was happening and they're not happy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The fact that the club is called You Be You in some circumstances, the Rainbow Clubs and others shows the intentional deception surrounding the club.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This elementary school requires permission to participate in gardening club, but somehow this club got lost in the shuffle of things according to the principal.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Again, this board has helped to create a district culture which both encourages child's sexualization and hides it from parents. Just a small problem with a stranger having secret sexual conversations with their eight-year-old.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And this lady thinks she's a dog. Or at least she says she thinks she's a dog. PRIMETIME thinks it's a sexual situation, but to each their own.Anyway, she called into an Australian radio show to talk about her life as a puppy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you have a boyfriend?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Handlers? They feed me. They take me on walks. We practice training, which is one of my favorite things because I get treats.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you do that in the park? Like do people give you funny looks?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know I don't find myself focusing on what other people, I guess are -- their reactions toward me, because I'm so in the moment of just being the dog.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And I really think it's time for a PRIMETIME victory.England's National Health Service just banned puberty blockers for kids. This is a huge deal, effectively banning sex changes for minors. Why? Well, England did a little digging and discovered there was "not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of the drugs." Makes you think why don't we do that here?The "Get It Together" series continues after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: In our "Get It Together" series, some of the people I interviewed for the book decided to come on TV and talk to us on PRIMETIME.Today, we're going to jump to Chapter 21 to talk to a prison reformer. Revolutionize the prison system says Shadi Jaber.Shadi was thrown in the slammer 20 years ago after committing a crime of opportunity. In prison, he had a rough time. And now he thinks if you commit a crime, prison isn't the answer.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WATTERS: How dangerous was being incarcerated? Were there weapons inside?SHADI JABER, PRISON REFORM ACTIVIST: Absolutely, absolutely. People would make weapons from tuna can tops, they would take the top off of a tuna can and sharpen it and make a big sword out of it.WATTERS: So you didn't have a great experience in the prison system. I think that's probably sometimes the point of the prison system. And later, you told me during our interview that you'd like prisons to be more like a halfway house.So if you commit a crime, you're not necessarily locked up 23 and one, you can go in and out to see family. You can go in and out to work and it's more like a dorm room. Explain why you believe that?JABER: Just because of the number of people that are repeat offenders. I think that that's the answer right there. I don't think there's any data that that proves that the way our prison systems operate right now is beneficial to the people that are in them and if it's not beneficial to the people that are in them, then I don't believe it would be beneficial to the society that they're coming back into.WATTERS: So you believe prison should be more of a rehab facility?JABER: Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes.WATTERS: Okay. What if someone's a real hardcore criminal, and they're committing violent felonies, you still want to give them that freedom of movement to go out and about, to go to a job, to go grocery shopping to come in and out? You trust these people?JABER: No, not to that. I wouldn't say that. I just feel as though people need -- a lot of the people that are incarcerated have a lack of education. I just feel as though they have a lot of things that they need to work on. And prison should be a place where they can get the education that they need, they can get the help that they need, a lot of psychological problems are there. A lot of childhood traumas and things of that nature and anger management.So I think that those services should be provided for inmates to help them re-enter into society.(END VIDEOTAPE)WATTERS: Shadi and I do not agree on everything, but we do agree that people need to be educated in prison. And one of the best ways to do that is to stock prison libraries with "Get It Together." And you can order your copy today. You can get your prison reading done at home.I did do some trampolining, and I just want to warn parents, if your child is three years old, you don't want to just bounce really, really hard next to him or her while they're lying prone on the trampoline. It can hurt their neck and it can flip them in all sorts of fantastic ways, which looks fun, kind of like they're just pieces of popcorn.But I think you're not supposed to be on a trampoline with children as adults. Just viewer warning. Jesse is fine.Ed from Wisconsin: The Kennedy-Rodgers ticket sounds good. But a Trump- Brady ticket, a real winner.Oh man, that might put Trump in some danger.Rick from Redding, California: Biden goes to Delaware on the weekends. VP Aaron Rodgers will go on Ayahuasca retreats on the weekends.It's about mind expansion.Hank from Pennsylvania: Bernie may be right. Why not a four-day workweek? The politicians work half that much.Should I be more open-minded about the four-day workweek?Akeila (ph) says yes.Rick from Florida: Jesse, if we ditch our phones, how are we supposed to text you?It's a good question. We're going to keep our phones.Always remember, I'm Watters. This is my world.
