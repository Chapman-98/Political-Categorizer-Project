I should have used "undocumented." I'm not going to treat any -- any -- any of these people with disrespect.WATTERS: Plus --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALES: What's up, Jesse Watters?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Comer to spring break.WATTERS: Sports and politics have mixed since the revolution. On the fields of Valley Forge, George Washington spent days playing rounders, an early form of baseball with his soldiers. And since then, savvy politicians have used athletic competitions to score votes.William Taft became the first president to throw out the opening pitch, doing it from his seat in the stands. At 330 pounds who knew Taft had an arm.Richard Nixon became the first president to sit in the stands in an NFL game, Redskins-Cowboys. He's smiling because he had money on Dallas.Now, when the Chicago Bulls were in their dynasty days in the 90s, Jordan wasn't always the most famous man in the arena. One night, couldn't score courtside seats, but President Clinton watched Chicago make a run for their fifth championship.And visiting the locker room even after the game, probably went out with Rodman that night.Presidential cameos during big games tell you a lot about the state of the nation. And over the weekend, former President Trump rolling into fight night in Miami.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER: Donald J. Trump flanked by UFC CEO, Dana White.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)ANNOUNCER: And watching the pageantry is just how big a Mixed Martial Arts fan Donald Trump is. He sits Octagon side with the cams on, absolutely loves online events, and a real privilege to have President Trump in the building at UFC 299.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: I can't think of a sporting event that Joe Biden could make an appearance in and receive standing ovations besides a WNBA game.The UFC fan base isn't partisan. They're just red blooded American men and their girlfriends. They're there to see knockouts. Trump walked in like he was the main event.Celebrities shaking hands, taking selfies. We see some familiar faces there. Friends of the show and some athletes, Bengals QB, Joe Burrow and San Francisco's defensive end, Nick Bosa hanging out with the president prefight.After Dustin Poirier he knocked out his opponent, he waltzed over and talked to Trump and Ivanka. Watch out, Jared.It was pay per view, millions watching at home and in bars across the country. Trump's face on the screen more than Joe Rogan's and he didn't have to buy $30 million in ads like the Biden campaign just did. This was his second stop of the day.Earlier, the president in Georgia, just hours before at a rally delivering his verdict on Joe's State of the Union.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Joe Biden should not be shouting angrily at America. America should be shouting angrily at Joe Biden.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And we should be saying, Crooked Joe, you're fired. Get out of here. You're fired. You're incompetent. You're incompetent. Get out of here. You're destroying our nation. Get the hell out of here.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now the room was at capacity 4,000 folks. Folks amassing at the entrance hours earlier, but there was another event in Georgia that day, Joe Biden, just a few miles away. The president of the United States on a Saturday, no one else has anything to do, these were the Biden voters clamoring to see his campaign event.Inside the room, there were more reporters than supporters. He had bigger crowds during COVID and it looked like the 12 people who came to see him speak half of them were there to boo.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PROTESTER: You're a dictator, too, Genocide Joe. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have died.(CROWD booing.)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: This is the tale of two campaigns. One is electric, the other is staged; one man cares, the other pretends to, and should probably write Georgia off after the Laken Riley murder.Donald Trump met with her family backstage before his speech, consoled them and laid her death at the feet of the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Biden has implemented a formal policy that illegal aliens who intrude into the United States are granted immunity from deportation. Thus, when this monster showed up at our border, he was set free immediately under the program that Crooked Joe created. I call it free to kill, it's free to kill.Now he was illegal, and I say he was an illegal alien. He was an illegal immigrant. He was an illegal migrant, and he shouldn't have been in our country and he never would have been under the Trump policy.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Meanwhile, the current president whose policies create death called Laken Riley the wrong name, and still hasn't even called her family to apologize. But Biden did apologize to someone, Laken's killer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JONATHAN CAPEHART, MSNBC HOST: You used the word "illegal" when talking about the man who allegedly killed Laken Riley.BIDEN: Undocumented. Undocumented person, and I shouldn't have used illegal, I should have used undocumented. I'm not going to treat any -- any -- any of these people with disrespect. Look, they built the country. The reason our economy is growing.CAPEHART: So you regret using that word.BIDEN: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden regrets disrespecting an illegal who killed an American. The illegal disrespected our border, our laws, and Laken Riley's life and Biden apologized to him.He didn't apologize to Laken's family for letting the killer into the country or for getting her name wrong, he apologized to her killer for getting his name right, an illegal immigrant is someone who immigrated into the country illegally. It's a crime to break into the country, just like it's a crime to break into a house.A burglar isn't undocumented because his name is not on the deed, he is a criminal because he is breaking and entering. That's illegal.Biden doesn't like saying illegal because it makes him complicit in the crime since he invited them here and release them and protects them from deportation.If illegals are just newcomers, it makes amnesty easier. But apologizing to migrant murderers in an election year, he is digging his political grave and the White House knows it and denies it was even an apology. Watch.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)OLIVIA DALTON, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: I want to be really clear about something. The president absolutely did not apologize. There was no apology anywhere in that conversation. He did not apologize. He used a different word.(END AUDIO CLIP)WATTERS: If I regret disrespecting you is not an apology, what is? The most pathetic part about this is the media made him apologize.No one cared he called the killer illegal except the media. Now look at what the media did. Good luck getting answers after this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Am I allowed to take any questions?(LAUGHTER)BIDEN: Anybody here in the staff?(LAUGHTER)(INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That was it. Bars.Whatever happened to Juiced Up Joe from the State of the Union? The fearless defender of democracy, the eloquent elder-in-chief, the political pugilist titillating Mika and Joe, what happened?Does the president still have it? Or did it wear off?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Pennsylvania, I have a message for you: Send me to Congress so I can support this right.The US Capitol, the same building where our freedoms came under assault on July the 6th.Tremendous amount of things you can cut, maybe precisely, tremendous amount of things you can do, not cut. He said I will -- but the bottom line is, he's still at it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: July 6th? Send me to Congress? Whatever happened to Lincoln and FDR? I guess, we're back to the real Biden. So where does he get his energy from?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CAPEHART: Onboard Air Force One, the president and I talked about how energized he is to take on Donald Trump, his likely opponent.Biden told me every time he hears Trump speak he gets "juiced up."After touching down in Atlanta, I witnessed juiced up energy firsthand as he and First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden met with minority business leaders at a local venue, The Gathering Spot.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Donald Trump, the only thing that gets Joe's juices flowing? Not the 10 million migrants pouring across the border? Not the gunfights in the streets? Not the high prices and low test scores?I don't want someone who wants to win for him. I want someone who wants to win for us.The forgotten men and women get Trump's juices flowing. It's time to make the American people the center of attention. I want a president obsessed with you, the voter; not with the other guy.Former ESPN host, Sage Steele joins me now.Sage, you were there at that Miami fight.SAGE STEELE, FORMER ESPN HOST: Yes.WATTERS: What was that like?STEELE: I have to say it's embarrassing that that was my first UFC event, Jesse, because I was always in studio.Absolutely incredible.I had heard what it was like in the prior two times recently that Trump came to a pay per view UFC event at Madison Square Garden, for instance, and how crazed everybody was. It was so intense, you couldn't hear yourself think when he was introduced, and of course, the procession over. Really incredible, and I think almost refreshing, rejuvenating to see 20,000 people on their feet for this man. Really, really special.And by the way, he isn't just making appearances. He has been alongside Dana White, the CEO, the founder of UFC, really from day one. He is so supportive of the sport, supportive of the athletes, and I witnessed the athletes talking to him, you know, in between rounds. They love him too.And to me, it was beautiful to sit back and just watch all of that happening, as well as the other athletes, NFL players that you showed coming up to him and nervously asking to take a picture. It was a fascinating scene to watch.WATTERS: They were nervous. They're not nervous when 300-pound linebackers are coming at them.STEELE: Yes. I was helping them take pictures.WATTERS: You're right. All right, so you saw his contrast with the events for like for the current President Joe Biden in Georgia, he still has not called the Riley family. He still has not corrected his mistake, called her Lincoln Riley, and now apologizing for calling her killer "illegal."He says he regrets that. He should have said "undocumented." He wants to respect the killer.How do you think that's going over with the country?STEELE: To me, it is almost as if we didn't need a final straw, right? But when that happens, and to me it wasn't even a political thing, a Biden- Trump whatever. I was heartbroken for that family.You know, first of all, I was like, wait, I know Biden as a football fan. He told me once when I interviewed him about what a great football player he is, but bad timing to get that confused and it goes back to I think the big picture, right?Number one, the family, and that breaks my heart, it is so wrong. Number two, shame on the family -- the Biden family for allowing this man with what we see happening mentally, frankly, for allowing someone they love to be put out there in this position.So to me, it's heartbreaking all around. Yes, for Laken Riley's family, right? But this is wrong for the family to have allowed him to be in this position in the first place.It's not okay for anyone, it is not okay for this country, and I know we can do better. This is when, Jesse, in my opinion, everybody has to put all their issues aside, with Donald Trump, with whoever it is, what is best for our country.Stop voting on emotion, vote on what we need done here to fix things. As a mother, I put myself in Laken Riley's mom's shoes. Unacceptable. And there's only one answer in my opinion as a voter.WATTERS: Yes. The hate has to stop dominating the discourse. You have to put country above your emotion. You're exactly right.STEELE: Yes.WATTERS: Sage, are you ever going to go back and see another fight? Or was that enough for you?STEELE: Oh, no. I'm completely obsessed with it.WATTERS: You're hooked now?STEELE: And the best part, Jesse, is when you're that close because I was right behind President Trump and Dana White, where you could hear -- like hear the hits and the punches and see the blood squirting everywhere. I want to go to all of them. That says a lot about me, doesn't it? Do not --WATTERS: It sure does. You're a very unique individual. And we have a lot of respect for your bravery. It's kind of like the same thing on "The Five" every day. You've got teeth flying out of people's mouths, bloody eyes. It's a fight. It's a rumble.Sage --STEELE: I have not been invited on that show yet. So we shall see.WATTERS: We shall see. We'll get you on one of these days. Thanks so much.STEELE: Thank you.WATTERS: PRIMETIME celebrates spring break.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: What issue facing America is most important to you?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The bouncers need to do a better job because I don't want to walk into a club full of ugly men.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: The Democrats in the media are realizing Biden can't be rehabbed, so Trump needs to be neutralized. No one is buying their hoaxes anymore, the indictments only reinforce Trump's connection with voters, so the media has an additional strategy, shame.Make regular Americans ashamed to associate with him. They will make Trump into a racist, Russian-loving rapist with a rap sheet and say, you're not going to ruin your reputation by aligning with that guy are you?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SARA FISCHER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA ANALYST: If he's going to be shameless, which is his greatest asset, the shamelessness of him, then Biden has to get in there very hard and go rapist, racist, fascist over and over and over again. Hammer it in with those three things -- rapist, racist, fascist.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: It's what high school girls do, and it can only work if the others are weak.Yesterday, ABC's George Stephanopoulos tried it with Nancy Mace, an actual rape victim who testified about her abuse. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: How do you square your endorsement of Donald Trump with the testimony we just saw?MACE: Well, I will tell you, I was raped at the age of 16 and any rape victim will tell you, I've lived for 30 years with an incredible amount of shame over being raped. I didn't come forward because of that judgment and shame that I felt.I'm not going to sit here on your show and be asked a question meant to shame me about another potential rape victim. I'm not going to -- I'm not going to do that.STEPHANOPOULOS: It's actually not about shaming you. It's a question about Donald Trump.MACE: No, you are shaming me.STEPHANOPOULOS: What you're doing is defending a man who has been found liable for rape. I don't understand how you can do that.MACE: Not in a criminal court of law. You're trying to shame me again by asking me this political question.STEPHANOPOULOS: You've repeated that -- you've repeated again, and again, and again.MACE: I think it is offensive. As a woman, I find your -- I find it offensive.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Have you ever witnessed this before? A woman shares with you that she has been raped and you respond with, well, what about Trump? Not, I'm sorry to hear that. That must have been so difficult, but you're a hypocrite.We asked ABC News about George's behavior and they said that George was just "asking meaningful questions that are relevant to our viewers."I wonder if George's work for Bill Clinton is relevant to their viewers because their anchor has a history of demeaning sexual abuse survivors and accusers.Back in the 90s, Stephanopoulos worked for the Clinton campaign and served in the White House and George had a whole war room dedicated to silencing Bill's accusers. It wasn't believe all women back then, it was belittle all women who accuse Clinton.And with the help of Carville and Hillary, they smeared everyone from Juanita Broderick to Jennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Connie Hamzy. We got a glimpse into these tactics in the '93 War Room documentary.("THE WAR ROOM" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, what's the name and address. I can send you a fax with names, addresses, phone numbers of who you had an affair with. You wouldn't make it true.It is completely bull (bleep). If you went on the radio and said that Bill Clinton is the father of an illegitimate Black child, you would be laughed at. People would think you're crazy.I guarantee you that if you do this, you'll never work in Democratic politics again. Maybe you don't want to, I'm not saying it matters.You will be embarrassed before the National Press Corps. People will think -- nobody will believe you. And people will think you're scummy.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Stephanopoulos is a Democrat knife fighter. He is there to win elections, not cover the news. In his book, Stephanopoulos called Bill's past accusers and alleged sexual partners "bimbos" multiple times. And when the truth broke about the Lewinsky scandal, Stephanopoulos wrote this: "My defense of Clinton against past bimbo eruptions had been predicated on my belief that he wouldn't create new ones."Stephanopoulos partied with Epstein after he was released from jail for soliciting prostitution from a minor. George had dinner at his mansion. How could George associate himself with men accused of rape? No one asks George this because you're not allowed to, but you're allowed to ask Republicans anything, even Republican rape victims on live TV.This is the new strategy: The shame game. And the same sheisty cynical operatives that slandered Clinton victims are back to victim shaming to keep another president in power.Kayleigh McEnany is the former White House press secretary and co-host of "Outnumbered."I don't know if this is going to go over the way that Stephanopoulos thinks it is, Kayleigh.KAYLEIGH MCENANY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CO-HOST "OUTNUMBERED": No, he looked horrible in this. But here's what I think is important. I think that this interview needs to be deconstructed because it should be a case study for what the Trump campaign, Republicans, conservatives are up against for the next eight months.When you look at this interview, he took something that was not newsworthy. The news of the week was State of the Union, Super Tuesday, Biden and Trump having rallies in Georgia, he ignored all of that. And remember, he is on the Sunday shows. He is supposed to cover the news.And instead he talked about Trump posting bond and E. Jean Carroll, even though the verdict was found weeks and weeks ago, it was not a newsworthy segment; however, he spent five minutes and 50 seconds grilling Nancy Mace on this, bringing up rape?And then at the five minute and 50 second mark, you know what he says? Let's turn to January 6th and spends all 10 minutes on January 6th and rape of a 44-minute show, Sunday show. That is what Republicans are up against.WATTERS: Well, January 6th, Biden calls it July 6th, this is the same thing.Kayleigh, Mace gave it back. Do you think that that has scared Stephanopoulos off from trying this shame game going forward?MCENANY: Yes. Yes.WATTERS: I mean, he's going to do this with Republican women going forward.MCENANY: Nancy Mace -- then every Republican woman should study what Nancy Mace did. She did not give an inch. She did not back down. She didn't stay on defense. No, she went on offense, and went right for the jugular with him.And what did Stephanopoulos look like? He looked like a scared fourth grade boy that had forgotten to study for the test and showed up and was scrambling for something to say. In fact, he kept saying the same thing over and over again. It was so rote that at points during that five minute and 50 seconds, I thought I had accidentally rewound the segment on YouTube. But no, it was just him saying the same thing.So every person who decides to go out on a Sunday show, study what Nancy Mace. Did find your offense talking point and prosecute the case, because that's what we need to do heading into November.WATTERS: And just study what Kayleigh does on "Outnumbered." That'll prepare you very well as well.MCENANY: Thanks. Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Thank you.Why Joe Biden is losing the Black vote. Dr. Ben Carson is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Fox News Alert: The FBI just admitted migrant crime is real -- sorry, Jen Psaki -- and it's about to get a lot worse. FBI Director Chris Wray testified in front of the Senate today and he confirmed what the media refuses to report. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: There are a whole host of threats that emanate from the border and some of them are criminal threats. We talked about fentanyl and violence.An awful lot of the violent crime in the United States is at the hands of gangs who are themselves involved in the distribution of that fentanyl.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: It's not just migrant crime. Migrant terror is next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WRAY: We are concerned about the terrorism implications from potential targeting of vulnerabilities at the border.There is a particular network that has -- where some of the overseas facilitators of the smuggling network have ISIS ties.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The FBI director is trying to tell Biden to close the border for the safety of the country, and the president won't listen. Democrats say migrants aren't illegal and they don't even break into the country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-IL): The undertone from your side is that somehow people who are coming illegally are trying to break into the country. I don't think that people are breaking into the country illegally.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: It may not appear like they're breaking in because Biden is just letting them break in, but it is still against the law.There is no denying that the American electorate is undergoing a radical racial realignment, non-White voters are flocking to the Republican party ahead of November. Look at this new analysis from "The Financial Times." Non-white voters are abandoning the Democrats in droves. They've been leaving in small numbers for decades, and then it really started hemorrhaging when Biden took office.And they're not just leaving, they're switching votes to Republican. Black Americans have been Democrats' most loyal voting base since the 60s. In 2020, Biden captured 90 percent of the Black vote. Today, he is polling 30 points lower while claiming this --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CAPEHART: You promised Black America that you'd have -- you'd have our back. Do you feel you have our backs?BIDEN: I have your back and I'm no more -- as much as any president has in American history since Lyndon Johnson.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: More than Obama? Nobody even believes that. Black voters are saying no to Joe because Joe doesn't understand the new generation.For months, the media has been trying to figure this out. They're like examining Black voters like an exotic foreign species.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right now, I couldn't tell you that, if they opened the polls tomorrow, I am voting for Joe Biden.NIKOLE KILLION, JOURNALIST: So what changed?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Life.I want the right person so that I'm not paying $8.00 for -- $15.00 for gas.The way these last three or four years have been, this is the worst that's ever been in my life. I never would have even considered thinking about voting for Donald Trump, but living in America these last four, it is a consideration.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Biden, he kind of sold a dream that he couldn't accomplish. His famous quote was that for African-Americans, you weren't Black if you weren't -- if you didn't vote for Joe Biden.KILLION: What do you think of former President Trump?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think President Trump was a bad people's person, but a great leader.He put our economy in a booming state.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Even husbands and wives from different parties are aligning. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KILLION: In 2008 and 2012, you voted for --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Barack Obama.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Barack Obama.KILLION: In 2016?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I voted for Donald Trump.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hillary Clinton.KILLION: 2020?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Biden.KILLION: And who will you vote for in 2024?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Donald Trump. Something has to happen. I mean, it's just so expensive to survive. And we're planning on having kids. I don't want to live in a stressful environment trying to rub two pennies together.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Former HUD Secretary, Dr. Ben Carson joins me now.So Dr. Carson, why do you believe that Black voters have been slowly and now, the acceleration has picked up, been moving from the Democratic Party into the Republican Party?DR. BEN CARSON, FORMER HUD SECRETARY: Well, thanks for having me, Jesse.I think Black voters are like every other Black voter. They have eyes, they have ears, and they have a brain and they are able to see in juxtaposition the Trump administration and the Biden administration right next to each other.They can ask themselves, were you better off? It's very easy to say inflation was much worse with Biden than with Trump. Unemployment -- record low unemployment, record high wages, record high home ownership with Trump; those things are moving in the other direction with Biden.You had preferential treatment for illegals with Biden; with Trump, you had the border basically secured, even with the opposition of the other party.I mean, there are just so many things that are different, and like I said, Black voters are no different than White voters or any other voters. They look at what works for them.And traditionally, Blacks have all gone to the Democratic Party. I grew up as a Democrat, a radical Democrat, and then I did something that you're not supposed to do. I listened to a Republican. I listened to Ronald Reagan.I said, he just doesn't sound like a horrible racist. He sounds like my mother. He has values and principles that are very similar to hers. The other thing about Donald Trump, and I think it's very attractive to a lot of Black people, is you don't have to wonder what he's thinking. I mean, he tells you what he's thinking.He's truthful, it may not always be what you want to hear, it may not be what you want him to say, but it gives you a sense of you, at least to know where you stand and it makes a good impression upon people.WATTERS: So he's a straight talker, and he put money in their wallets. And that rearview mirror isn't that far away. Because you could just remember three-and-a-half years ago, we hear the same thing.We're also hearing about you possibly being in the running for VP, is that something you're open to?CARSON: Well, I'm certainly not running for anything except for ways to save our country. That's really the key right now and I think that's what President Trump wants to do. You think about the fact that he already had all the fame that anybody could have, had a tremendous amount of money. There wasn't really any big advantage for him. And in fact, it's been very detrimental, but he's still willing to get in there.And I think all of us who are interested in saving this country, because this is no longer about Democrats and Republicans. This is about those people who believe in the values and principles that made this into a great country and those who want to fundamentally change us into something else.WATTERS: All right, Dr. Ben Carson from a radical Democrat to a great doctor, a great guest, and a great American. Thank you so much.CARSON: Thank you, Jesse.WATTERS: Well, something was missing from the Academy Awards last night.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Hollywood gushed over "Oppenheimer" last night at the Oscars celebrating a movie about the atomic bomb. I haven't seen it, but I've heard good things.Oppenheimer created the ultimate weapon and the ultimate deterrent that so far prevented World War Three. But the same people embracing the bomb had been trying to dismantle our nuclear arsenal for decades.Suddenly, they love the A Bomb because they made a movie about it. But they didn't actually want to talk about the bomb.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The reason this movie was the movie that was with Chris Nolan.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you for those who have been there for me and believed in me my whole career.ROBERT DOWNEY, JR., ACTOR: What we do is meaningful and the stuff that we decide to make is important.CILLIAN MURPHY, ACTOR: We made a film about the man who created the atomic bomb. And for better or for worse, we're all living in Oppenheimer's world so I would really like to dedicate this to the peacemakers.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Seven acceptance speeches for "Oppenheimer" and only one mention of the bomb. Hollywood is quick to move on from a cause once it's served them.Remember just a few years ago when Hollywood went all in for Haiti. They had the t-shirts. They pushed a whole donation campaign trying to convince us that Haiti is great already.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CONAN O'BRIEN, TALK SHOW HOST: It's a hat that says, "Haiti is Great Already." We offered it to them and they were quite happy to have it. People really liked the slogan in Haiti.They like it so much so that omaze.com is now exclusively offering this "Haiti is Great Already" t-shirt to raise money for two amazing charities.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Well, the country's a mess again.A gang leader named Barbecue runs Haiti now. He got the name from burning people alive. Maybe Haiti would be greater if the Clintons had gotten the island all the money they'd raised. Does Hollywood have anything to say about that? No.Radical protesters are waking up to Hollywood's performative activism. Despite so many actors wearing ceasefire pins last night, the Oscars still faced a flood of pro-Hamas protesters swarming the ceremony outside. Remember last year when everybody in Hollywood had their Ukraine pins. I wonder what fashionably sad country will be pinpricked into Hollywood lapels next year.Former celebrity fitness trainer, Jillian Michaels joins me now. Jillian, did you enjoy the award ceremony last night?JILLIAN MICHAELS, FORMER CELEBRITY FITNESS TRAINER: I didn't watch it. I was watching the Gold Cup Final. I watched America beat Brazil. So when they told me we were going to be talking about it today, I did a real brush up fast on the internet today.WATTERS: Okay, I was watching the Academy Awards and you are watching sports. This is kind of embarrassing. But from what you've learned after watching it on tape -- how did it strike you?MICHAELS: Listen, Hollywood and California, in general, is a place where you go along to get along. I grew up here. I've been guilty of it. If we're giving the benefit of the doubt, it's like, oh, I better do this, this must be the right thing. And if I don't do it, are they going to cancel me? Which by the way, probably.In addition, and I've been guilty of this as well, you do things in a performative way, because you think that you're more important than you are. And I'm being honest, I did that when I was younger, in my 30s and I get all this attention then. I must matter, my opinion must matter, and you step out of your lane, you upset a lot of people, you patronize a lot of people and it is a mistake I haven't made for about a decade now, but that's where that's coming from.And then there's the virtue signalers that just want to be liked. And Ozempic is a perfect example, not to harp on this one, but it is like, oh, you're healthy at any size. You're a hundred pounds overweight, You go girl, but not me.
