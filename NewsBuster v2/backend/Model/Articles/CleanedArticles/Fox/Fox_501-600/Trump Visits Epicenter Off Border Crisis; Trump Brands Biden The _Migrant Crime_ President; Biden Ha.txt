CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, but also, you know, that poll is a reflection of right now. That's before you've had a minute of campaigning between Gavin Newsom and Donald Trump.LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Yes.HURT: Who just came up with a new nickname today. "Newscum."INGRAHAM: Oh, no. Yes, not having it, Gavin.All right, Jason and Charlie, thanks so much.Jesse is next.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The United States is being overrun by the Biden migrant crime.JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So it's time for us to move on this. We can't wait any longer.WATTERS: Trump and Biden have a good old fashioned Texas standoff. Ted Nugent is here.MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: Why are White rural voters a threat to democracy?TOM SCHALLER, AUTHOR, "WHITE RURAL RAGE": They're the most racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant and anti-gay.WATTERS: Whites are now a threat. I'm scared.KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So-called leaders want to shut down DEI. They're trying to do with DEI, diversity, equity and inclusion what they sadly successfully did with woke.WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday, Kamala.Plus --JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: What important things has Hillary done for women?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nothing that I can come up with right now. Sometimes I don't even think she's real.WATTERS: Fox News Alert: It is a border showdown. Trump and Biden both hit Texas today, but where they went and what they did was completely different.As soon as Trump landed, he said a few words to the camera, talked to fans, shook hands. Biden landed, he said hi to some politicians then disappeared into an SUV.Biden is in Brownsville, which used to be a migrant hotspot until the governor secured it with razor wire. Razor wire Biden tried to snip. There is no action in Brownsville. Last night, only six migrants crossed. That's why Biden chose it for his photo-op. If he went to a sector with a lot of foot traffic or as Jill Biden says, a lot of tacos, it could turn into the biggest Biden rally of the year. Muchos gracias, Jose. That wouldn't help.Biden didn't even look at the razor wire that secured the border in Brownsville. They took them to a sanitized setup where not a single migrant was being processed, probably safer this way.Biden couldn't handle the terrain. Nancy wasn't there to hold his hand and almost face planted on a cactus. Now, once they corral them indoors, Border Patrol agents had to guide them around like a fragile animal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Anyway, it's amazing. It's amazing.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, HSI. Thank you ERO. Sir, it is time for remarks and our briefers, I invite you to our seats. And then we'll escort you this way.BIDEN: Okay.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, sir. We'll now come over here with our friends from ICE, HIS and ICE ERO.BIDEN: It's good to see you, man.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, sir.BIDEN: Thank you. Got to stand on my mark. My mark is back here. I've got to -- I'm told where I stand, little Xs, I got to be careful what I do here.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: If you don't tell Biden where to stand, he might wander into Mexico where the Sinaloa Cartel will probably throw him a fiesta.Now, Trump was 300 miles away in Eagle Pass. That's the epicenter of the illegal crossings in Texas. The former president marched down a dirt path flanked by fencing and then locked eyes with a caravan across the Rio Grande. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Trump.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump.BIDEN: They like Trump, can you believe it?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now after getting a raw tour of the border, Trump grabbed the mic and let it rip, branding Biden as the migrant crime president. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Now, the United States is being overrun by the Biden migrant crime. It's a new form of vicious violation to our country. It's migrant crime. We call it Biden migrant crime, but that's a little bit long.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Every time you hear migrant crime, you think Biden. These are Biden's migrants. He invited them, he let them in, and if you get hurt, that's on him.He still won't say Laken Riley's name.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Mr. President, do you bear any responsibility for Laken Riley's death?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden still hasn't called the family. But at this point, he was on a first name basis with George Floyd's relatives. He checked his watch as the coffins came home, ignores the East Palestine toxic train wreck for a year, and falls asleep at funerals. He can't even perform the basics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I spoke to her parents yesterday. They are incredible people. They are devastated beyond belief. But she was beautiful -- just so beautiful in so many ways and brutally assaulted horrifically beaten, kidnapped and savagely murdered.The monster that is charged in the death is an illegal alien migrant who was led into our country and released into our communities by crooked Joe Biden. He's crooked. I took the name away from Hillary because she's no longer relevant, I guess.She was terrible, but he is -- what he is doing is just unbelievable.Joe Biden will never say Laken Riley's name, but we will say it and we will remember. We're not going to forget her.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Laken Riley would be alive today if Biden had just done his job, the job all presidents have done before him, protect the homeland from an illegal alien invasion.Donald Trump says Biden doesn't know it, but we're at war.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It's a military operation. We have a military -- this is like a war. It is a military operations.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now the president is allowing a cartel run Trojan horse military campaign into the heart of the homeland and he is blaming Trump for it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: So here's what I would say to Mr. Trump, set a planned policy for this issue, instead of telling members of Congress to block this legislation. Join me, I'll join you in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now, let's save $20 billion and put up razor wire, stop catch- and-release and make them remain-in-Mexico instead of remain in America.Now, it wasn't too long ago that Biden's border guy was bragging about what they've done.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, US HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: We have rescinded so many Trump immigration policies, it would take so much time to list them.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The Biden administration doesn't even call them migrants anymore, they call them "newcomers."Well, one of Biden's newcomers from Guatemala was just arrested for raping an 11-year-old in Utah. Jonathan Garcia says he met the girl at a soccer game and thought she was 13. Mr. Garcia, I don't know about in Guatemala, but in Estados Unidos, 13 is still rape.Many of Biden's newcomers are unfamiliar with, how shall I say it? Our cultural standards. And now we're reporting a migrant rape almost every day.Immigration is the top issue in this country and Trump has a 35-point advantage on it, a 35-point advantage on the top issue in America. That's the reason Biden went to Texas. He is struggling to save himself from political deportation.You know how you know when it's political, when they tell you it's not.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This is not about politics for the president.And it was not about politics.This is not about politics for the president.So again, not about politics --Because this is not about politics.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden and Trump brought every news camera in the country to the border today. It's an optics war and Trump won. The voters have soured on Joe, there is no coming back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's wasting his time. Mr. President, what are you doing here? By a stroke of a pen, you can stop this. You don't need Congress.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It feels like it's a day late and a dollar short.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know what his purpose is to be quite honest. We've had this situation for years. He has not shown up. It just seems a little too -- a little too late.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden could have come to the border, apologize to the agency smeared with the racist whipping hoax. He could have witnessed the detention center stuffed to the gills. He could have said Laken Riley's name, but he didn't.The president is fading like a ghost. Nothing is clicking.His son is being deposed about felonies. The Hur report says he's old and slow. Fani is blowing up Georgia. The Supreme Court is throttling his legal strategy.A hundred thousand Democrats just voted against him in Michigan. Migrants are on a murder spree and his dog bites everyone in sight.They say if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog. He doesn't even have one anymore.Let's bring in nationally syndicated radio host, Dana Loesch and America First Legal founder, Stephen Miller.Dana, you're a Texas girl. What did that look like to you today?DANA LOESCH, SYNDICATED RADIO HOST: It looked like just a photo-op. It was a waste of taxpayer dollars for the president of the United States to come to Texas, Jesse, and then grandstand at the most sanitized part of the border where force multipliers have worked in the state so much so that all of this -- the massive amounts, the caravans, all the migrant caravans, the millions of people that have been crossing every single year, now they're going to different parts of the southern border.And I thought that President Trump going to Shelby Pass, going down there to Shelby Park in Eagle Pass. That's the place to go to. That's the place that's -- you know, that's ground zero for the lack of a better way to put it in this standoff between Texas and the federal government.And just today, Jesse, it came out, you know in this battle between Texas Governor Greg Abbott and the Biden administration now, Texas has its hands tied once again and the ability to actually detain people who enter the country illegally and prosecute them or send them back to Mexico.Again, Texas's hands are tied. We're spending millions upon millions upon millions of taxpayer dollars in Texas, to carry out Joe Biden's lawlessness. And to that audio soundbite, you played of that one gentleman, Jesse, all of Joe Biden has to do, literally is use his executive authority, and he can reinstate all of those orders that were under the Trump administration, the ones that he undid his first week in office. He could put those back in place.So until he does that, this is a heartless cruel photo-op. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars.WATTERS: Stephen, they're just newcomers, though, not migrants. They are just newcomers.STEPHEN MILLER, FOUNDER, AMERICA FIRST LEGAL: Yes, and some of those newcomers, Jesse are bludgeoning woman to death while they're out on a morning jog, are raping children, are plowing dangerously down the road killing fathers, killing mothers, killing whole families. There is carnage all over the streets of this country carried out by these newcomers.Let's talk about what Joe Biden did because it's very simple. He came into office, and he ordered Border Patrol to release en masse millions of illegal aliens and for the first time in history, to release en masse fighting age men, men in their 20s, men in their 30s by the millions into the country and he did this knowing full well at his age, knowing full well that in those groups would be predators and rapists and killers.This is a moral crime against the entire nation and the fact that he doesn't have the fundamental humanity to say the words, to say the name Laken Riley, because your policies killed her, Joe. Your policies killed her.And to the Senate Democrats that say they're not going to even let there be a trial against Mayorkas, and I'm looking at you Jon Tester. I'm looking at you Sherrod Brown, you become accessories to those crimes. You become accomplices to those heinous barbaric acts of violence against American citizens.If you will not stand up, hold the trial for Mayorkas and throw him out of office, the blood of innocent Americans has been shed too long. Do something, dammit. Do something. People are dying, Jesse, and this administration is counting votes, counting new voters. It makes me sick.WATTERS: There are going to be Laken Rileys after Laken Rileys in this country, week after week after week until this election. That's the saddest part about this.I've got to go. We've got on the other side, Ted Nugent.Guys, thank you so much. Stephen Miller, Dana Loesch, always a pleasure.Cities all across the United States crumbling from this invasion. Crime is up, resources down and Americans are telling politicians to resign. A new spirit is stirring in this country similar to the Tea Party movement. You can feel it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES LEE, ATHENS, GEORGIA RESIDENT: This mayor has violated his oath of office. He is supposed to protect Athenians, citizens of Athens, not protect illegal criminal aliens.And by the way, they're not illegal immigrants. Immigrants or people who come here legally. These are criminal illegal aliens.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Rock icon and American sporting legend, Ted Nugent joins me now.Ted, you're pretty plugged into the scene. Can't you feel this bubbling up from the ground this anger, this energy in the country?TED NUGENT, ROCK ICON: Well, Jesse, it is not bubbling up, it is an active volcano. And I've got to tell you, I ditto Stephen Miller and Dana Loesch and you, the good people -- the good families of America salute you, Jesse, because boy, you are a truth, logic and common sense hellraiser and we've all determined that you deserve me, because that's the bottom line here. The people have got to rise up and we see it happening all the time.That young man, well young compared to me, who stood up and called the Athens mayor a liar because he is a liar. Laken Riley is merely the tip of an ugly, ugly situation where there's a lot of Laken Rileys out there. There's a lot of victims by our own government.Uncle Sam is now engineering recidivism, engineered recidivism at an unprecedented rate. And the explosion of violent crime is literally by the hands of Joe Biden and his criminal treasonous administration.And I've got to tell you, Donald Trump nailed it at the border today. I was down at the border with Sheriff Brad Cole of Christian County and the great Colonel Allen West and Governor Greg Abbott and Pat Curry who's running for 56th District here in Texas and Parnell McNamara, the sheriff of McLennan County, there is a rising up of We, the People who demand law and order, who demand legality.You know, they are not illegal immigrants, they are invaders. They're dangerous invaders and the explosion of violent crime is a direct result of the policies of sanctuary cities under Joe Biden.Everybody knows this. I'm just repeating the obvious here, but thank you for having me on because America is really pissed off and we have to get back to God, family, and country that will take Donald Trump and guys like Pat Curry and Parnell McNamara.WATTERS: Is it treason what the president of the United States is orchestrating?NUGENT: Clearly, I mean, I'm a Sheriff Deputy up in Michigan, I've been for 39 years now, and every four years I take that sacred constitutional oath and those words are divine intervention.We, the People experiment in self-government. It is the only one in the history of mankind and what Joe Biden is doing is he is failing his number one moral and constitutional obligation to secure the United States of America. If that's not treason, I don't know what is.WATTERS: Yes, he broke the bank. He broke the border. He broke his oath. He broke his promise that he was only going to be a one-term president. He is terrible. The guy has got to go.It's a shame, he has to go.'Ted Nugent, thanks so much for joining JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.NUGENT: Amen.WATTERS: Next time, I'm in Texas, I'd love to swing by.NUGENT: Come on by. We'll shoot some pigs.WATTERS: All right, it's a deal.So PRIMETIME just got the Hunter Biden transcripts. Oh, they're hilarious.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Fox News Alert: We just got our hands on the transcripts of Hunter Biden's deposition and it is a doozy.Investigators asked why did every member of your family get paid by the Chinese? Uncles, nieces, granddaughters, sisters-in-law? Hunter says no, no. For example, my Uncle Jimmy, Joe Biden's brother, he wasn't in business with me or with China, even though his name was on all the documentation: "I wanted my uncle to be an advisor to me. So I sent money to him."That some advisor. The Chinese were getting arrested in their first call. You know, the one where you get when you're in jail first time, was to Joe Biden's brother, Jimmy, just an advisor. I wonder what kind of advice Joe Biden's granddaughter gave to Hunter to deserve thousands in cash.Very interesting corporate structure. Hunter is in business with China and everyone else in the Biden family is Hunter's advisor. Cool.Well, then Hunter was asked, well, why was your father, Joe Biden, when he was vice president and after showing up to all of your business dinners with Russians, Ukrainians and Chinese? He says: "I wasn't conducting business when I had those meetings. My dad stopped by because it was my actual birthday."All right, so Hunter is in his 50s and he has a birthday party. He doesn't invite anyone from his family, his woman, his kids are or friends. He invites Russian billionaires and Kazakhstani tycoons. Oh, when his dad happens to stop by to celebrate his birthday.Well, what did your father talk about with all of your suspicious looking rich foreign business partners? Hunter said, all his dad did was have a Coca-Cola and a bowl of spaghetti. Son, happy birthday. Who are all these people? Well, this lady is from Moscow, dad, and I'll be driving home and a new Porsche.Hunter had a lot of business meetings where his dad stopped by. Those aren't my words. Those are Hunter Biden's words. He says: "I was in New York City and was having lunch with some of my business associates. And I said, hey, dad, come by for lunch. Who wouldn't do that?"We went from Joe Biden didn't know anything about Hunter's foreign business to Joe Biden had dinners and lunches with Hunter's foreign businessmen. Why wouldn't he? Hunter then said, yep, my dad's the Big Guy.The investigators then asked Hunter, well, what about when you threatened the Chinese to pay you millions of dollars and your dad was in the room with you? And you said he'd be very angry if they didn't pay up. Hunter said he sent that text to the wrong Chinese guy.But that's quite a coincidence because the next day, he got wired five million bucks. That would mean some random Chinese guy got a text from Hunter who he didn't know, and the next day wired him $5 million even though he didn't have his why wiring instructions. Okay.What about the diamonds the Chinese kept giving you and you kept losing? Well Hunter said it probably wasn't even a diamond. It was just a stone. So the Chinese by $23 million in diamonds, gave it to Hunter and Hunter didn't think it was worth anything and threw them out. Okay.But then he says, that's the way the Chinese do business: "Its business culture in China. When I first received the diamond, I thought it was an extravagant gift. We gave Mr. Yi a Magnum bottle of, I think, scotch 67 Macallan that ultimately was worth far more than the diamond he gave us."Okay. We spoke to American business executives who've done business in China for decades, not a single one of them said they've ever been given a diamond or a stone. And does Hunter even have a receipt for the scotch he gave the Chinese? No. Probably like Fani, paid cash."New York Post" columnist, Miranda Devine joins us now.This is Fani Willis level testimony and I love it. I just want to see it live on video. Can we do that please, Congress?MIRANDA DEVINE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, I think Hunter Biden wants to do that. He is doing a documentary. He knows that he's become a bit of a celebrity. But look, what his testimony did was embarrass, humiliate his father, the White House, all the Biden campaign spokespeople who lied to us from the beginning about everything that we were reporting from the laptop, and particularly to the media that has carried water for Joe Biden, and gone along with the lie that he had nothing to do with his son's business dealings.And, you know, over the last year, we've had all these former business partners of Hunter come forward and say, there were meetings and they were breakfasts, and they were lunches and dinners and speaker phone conversations with these foreign clients who were giving Hunter and his family millions of dollars. And they all poo-pooed, they said there's no evidence.And here's Hunter Biden himself, admitting them, quite freely saying, yes, sure. I mean, he did have memory lapses at crucial moments. You know, like the diamond and like various meetings, and he can't remember the Big Guy e- mails and he can't remember some of the money that came through.But he still admitted enough that shows that we have been spot on and so have you, so has Fox. Fox and "The New York Post" have been spot on with our reporting from the beginning and we've been traduced and censored and treated like idiots by the rest of the media, and they now have egg all over their face because Hunter Biden himself has admitted the truth about all of these meetings and Joe's involvement in his son and he's brother's influence peddling operation.WATTERS: I love it. He just testified under oath my dad is the big guy. It's over. Probably not. He's going to get away with everything.DEVINE: And denied it.WATTERS: But come on, it's too good. It is too good.Miranda, thank you so much.DEVINE: It is great.WATTERS: And thanks for all your very aggressive reporting on this. You and "The Post" have really driven the story.DEVINE: Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Well, Johnny celebrates Women's History Month.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Who is this?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Barbara Walters.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Last night, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Donald Trump's immunity claim for his January 6th case and the left is crestfallen because the court won't rule until June and their need for a Trump conviction before the election may go unfulfilled, which is why last night kind of looked like election night in '16 when they realized they just lost.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: The cravenness of the court is evident in what they are doing with the pacing here.WHOOPI GOLDBERG, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": It's a bad look for them. It's a very bad --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To have it.GOLDBERG: To have taken it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: It is an unmistakable sign from the MAGA majority of the Trump created court that they are with him.ANDREW WEISSMANN, FORMER FBI GENERAL COUNSEL: And there is a lot tonight to be pessimistic about.MSNBC GUEST: And I am beyond terrified, Nicolle, right now for our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And MSNBC has taken this ruling to mean that Trump won't just be dictator on day one, he will be dictator for life.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MADDOW: When they inevitably rule that presidents aren't immune from prosecution after they leave office, what that will tell Donald Trump if by then he is president is that he can never leave the office of the presidency.And if he is voted out in 2028, he cannot leave office and he is willing to commit -- he is welcome to commit any crime he wants to as long as he is still president in order to ignore the result of that election and stay in power for life because otherwise he is going to go to prison when he gets out.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now Maddow knows Trump's going to leave after four years. She's just peeved the Supreme Court isn't abiding by NBC's schedule.So the January 6 case is getting calendared. Fani likely DQ'ed in Georgia. The documents case in Florida probably pushed back until after November and the Alvin Bragg case is a laughingstock. And if this gives you any sense of the unseriousness of the move to strip Trump from the ballot, the judge who just did it in Illinois, is straight out of traffic court.Now Democrats realize Joe is on his own here. He's not getting help from judges. The Democrats have to persuade 150 million voters instead of just a few people in robes.Outkick founder, Clay Travis joins me now.I remember election night 2016 watching the faces of the press, the scowling, the tears, the drama. I'm seeing some signs of that, Clay.CLAY TRAVIS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: I love Rachel Maddow breaking down already and basically saying that Trump's going to become a dictator. I think we have to start calling this what it is, Jesse.This is potentially the most devastating own goal in the history of American politics. They have managed to, as you said set themselves up to only get a business bookkeeping potential felony conviction in New York City with Alvin Bragg. Meanwhile, they have strengthened Donald Trump massively with his Republican base and with all of the Independent voters such that the last two polls of swing states, Trump's up in all seven states.We're not talking about Donald Trump squeaking by, Jesse, we're talking about him potentially winning a modern day landslide all because Democrats blew it.It's delicious and delectable. I absolutely love it.WATTERS: I know. I don't want to agree with you because I'm going to jinx it. So I'm going to move on to probably the most racist segment we've ever seen. It was on MSNBC last night and here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRZEZINSKI: Why are White rural voters a threat to democracy?SCHALLER: They are the most racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay geodemographic group in the country. Second, they're the most conspiracist group. QAnon support and subscribers, election denialism, COVID denialism, and scientific skepticism, Obama birtherism.Third, anti-democratic sentiments. They don't believe in an independent press, free speech. They're also the most strongly White nationalist and White Christian nationalists and fourth, they are most likely to just excuse or justify violence as an acceptable alternative to peaceful public discourse.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So let's just kill them all, right?TRAVIS: White people love to call other White people racist. I mean, that's a big staple of MSNBC and what I would love to hear, Jesse, I bet that White rage author, if you asked him, hey, by the way, how come no Black people voted for Mayor Pete in the South Carolina primary in 2020? Literally, no one would show up and vote for the gay White guy. Is that because of homophobia?He wouldn't even answer it because that would require him to examine his thesis that White rural people are awful human beings. He wouldn't apply the same standards to Black Democrat voters.WATTERS: Clay, if you get lost in rural White America, they will invite you inside, they'll cook you dinner, they'll talk your ear off.TRAVIS: That's a hundred percent correct.WATTERS: They'll give you a blanket. You'll sleep there next to their probably family and their daughter. They'll probably invite you for Thanksgiving. It's the nicest group of people you'll ever meet, and I am not saying that as a White guy.TRAVIS: Hundred percent right. That is the heartbeat of college football kings.WATTERS: I am saying that as someone who has been lost in the woods. Clay, thank you so much.TRAVIS: You lived most of your life lost in the woods as we all know, Jesse. Appreciate you having me.WATTERS: That's true. I did. I tried to get lost.Kamala is now celebrating DEI Thursday.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: We will be doing this on a weekly basis. DEI is something we must have.WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday, PRIMETIME's favorite day of the week, in honor of Reverend Al Sharpton, we're bringing you the best stories about diversity, equity, and inclusion.First up, changing your sex leads to strange revelations. Here's a man who says he used to be a woman claiming people treat him totally differently now that he's a dude. He says he's got male privilege(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: PRIMETIME has been saying for a while now that it's up to women to keep men out of their sports if there's a man playing against you, you forfeit. Well it looks like people are listening because a girls basketball team in Vermont refused to play a game against a team with a trans player.And now, they're banned from the league.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are differences between male and female. We are created differently. We decided to forfeit that game and withdraw from the tournament.And at that point, the state of Vermont governing body kicked us out of all athletic competitions in the state.Boys just play at a different speed, a different force, you know than the girls play at. It's a different game.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But Fani Willis isn't doing so hot right now, I think we all know that. But it turns out Fani loves DEI Thursday, too.Breitbart reporting that whistleblowers from her office say she forced them to take a racist DEI training test. The test prompts you to associate good with Black and bad with White. It also questions you about whether you hang out with Blacks or Whites, and whether Black people are lazy.My booker took the test and it call him a racist.And no DEI Thursday is complete without a PRIMETIME victory.The Tennessee House just passed a bill that would ban the display of pride flags in public schools. Liberals aren't happy, but we believe the only flags that should be flown in the classroom are your state's flag and the stars and bars.So Happy DEI Thursday, everybody.Now we know Kamala watches "The Five" so she probably watches DEI Thursday, too. And now she's standing in solidarity with Al and us, defending diversity, equity and inclusion from the likes of you.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HARRIS: Because we are proudly talking about equity even though these people on the, you know, so-called leaders want to shut down DEI. They trying to -- they're trying to do with DEI, diversity, equity, and inclusion, what they sadly successfully did with woke.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Of course, she's going to defend it. It's why she was hired, but Kamala wasn't done yet.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HARRIS: Having progressive prosecutors, for example, who can show what is possible, and then show that it works and show that frankly, it's not contrary at all to public safety. In fact, it is a better way, it is a very effective way, among other ways to achieve public safety.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Goodbye, Black History Month, get ready for Women's History Month.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Just a little clarification stars and stripes, not stars and bars.Earlier this week, Joe Biden was licking ice cream cones and talking about the border and the Mideast war. You can't take anybody seriously with their tongue hanging out and vanilla ice cream dripping from it. The White House should agree with that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: I want to read you a quote from Jesse Watters on Fox who said a grown man especially the president should not be licking ice cream in public.I wonder if you have a reaction to the outrage over the public eating of ice cream.KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: That's just false outrage. I don't really have more to say beyond that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Clarification, I did say only on vacation are you allowed to do that, and our thoughts about this are neither faux nor outraged. We considered a constructive criticism and it's a nonpartisan piece of advice. And it applies to straws and soups, but the ice cream thing, infantile and kind of a tongue thing.Tomorrow marks Women's History Month, a month where we celebrate powerful women of our nation. So we sent Johnny to ask about some of the most famous ladies in our country and what they think of them.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)BELISARIO: Who is this?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Troublemaker.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Kim Kardashian.
