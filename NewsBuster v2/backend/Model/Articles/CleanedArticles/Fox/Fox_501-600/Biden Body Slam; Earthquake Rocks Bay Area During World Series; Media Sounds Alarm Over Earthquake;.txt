Watch this.It doesn't seem so incredible this video.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: How did the toddler not notice the earthquake? Toddlers are so perceptive. Nothing gets by them. Well, maybe it's because nothing really fell off the shelf.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know if this is an earthquakeUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel like I am going to sit down.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: No one died. No one is hurt. And every building is still standing.One guy was getting a vasectomy during the quake. Close call.

We've been through Civil Wars, World Wars, drafts, assassinations, terror attacks, pandemics. Gutfeld!Florida, Texas, Kansas -- they get decimated by hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, but they bounce back. Northern California had seven earthquakes this week. You don't hear about them because reporters don't live there.When New York gets a 10-second shake, we report it like it's the world's first earthquake and then we blame climate change.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NBC NEWS REPORTER: Naturally, this left me wondering, could climate change play a role in the frequency of these felt quakes?NBC NEWS GUEST: In terms of climate change, if we have sea level rise, for instance, we're going to change the amount of pressure that the ocean is exerting on the shelves and on the coastlines.And some of that weight will help to maybe trigger some earthquake activity.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Earthquakes have been happening forever, and New York has seen 500 earthquakes since the 1700s.

We just have to appreciate every second we have on this Earth and live every day like it's our last.Be grateful for what you have.We're all just so insignificant in the grand scheme of things.Let's reflect in a moment of silence.Dr. Michio Kaku joins me now. He is a theoretical physicist and author of "Quantum Supremacy."You're from California.DR. MICHIO KAKU, THEORETICAL PHYSICIST, AUTHOR OF "QUANTUM SUPREMACY": I was born and raised in California.WATTERS: What was today like?KAKU: It's a rite of passage that you experience earthquakes. I remember as a child looking at the wall seeing pictures wobbling like this. It's just normal. That's the way it is in California. So get used to it.WATTERS: Get used to it.What happens in an earthquake? My son asked me, all I know was tectonic plates shifting and that's all I had.KAKU: Well, California earthquakes are different from earthquakes here in the New York area.California is riddled with earthquake faults. There are four faults that don't travel very far. Earthquakes never go beyond the borders of California, let's say. They are severe, they are sharp, but they don't go very far.However, we are in the middle of the North American plate. Thousands of miles across, and when it moves, it moves as a block.Therefore, earthquakes travel thousands of miles, unlike the ones in California, but they're mild, and they're not very frequent as a consequence.So their flip side, they are two sides of the same coin, California earthquakes and earthquakes in the Northeast.WATTERS: All right, so we have an earthquake today, and on Monday, we're supposed to see what? A solar eclipse. What is happening, Doctor?KAKU: Well, you know, different politicians are declaring state government urgencies because they're expecting inundations of SUVs and RVs and hotels are being booked because everyone wants to catch the eclipse.Now why? My theory is that it is because people are making their bucket list now and they want to say that once or twice in their lifetime, they saw Mother Nature, Mother Nature create his fireworks in outer space.Plus, the space program is coming back. You know, for decades, a space program is kind of boring. You know, you shoot astronauts up, they come back down. So what? Now, billionaires and private citizens are going up in outer space. Elon Musk is actually charging passengers, civilians to go to the moon and so there's a new energy.WATTERS: Yes. There is a new energy and I have a few recommendations for civilians who I would like to send to the moon.Doctor, back in the olden days, when native peoples experienced earthquakes and solar eclipses, what did they believe it signified?KAKU: Well, they were close to Mother Nature, okay. We're more divorced with Mother Nature because we have our swimming pools and our nice houses and all, but the native peoples were very in touch with the seasons and they were very much in touch with what was happening around them. And we kind of like lost that touch, that connection.WATTERS: Okay, we have to get back to that deep, deep connection. I've already had it so, it is mostly up for other people.Doctor, thank you very much.KAKU: My pleasure.WATTERS: Joe Biden just got some bad news from The Rock.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: America loves The Rock.(WWE VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)ANNOUNCER: If you smell what The Rock is cooking.JOHNSON: Without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest sports in the arena the world has ever seen.The Rock has come back.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The wrestling superstar turned Hollywood frontman turned business mogul took Hollywood by storm. "People" Magazine named him the top reason to love America.Jesse Watters again overlooked, not mad, just pointing it out, The Rock earned the title of Sexiest Man Alive. I know we all had someone else in mind.When Dwayne Johnson speaks, people listen, and guess who he endorsed in 2020.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNSON: So I figured let's kick this conversation off this way, by me officially publicly endorsing you both to become president and vice president of our great country.KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Oh, That's fantastic.JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you. Thank you, thank you.HARRIS: Thank you.BIDEN: That means a great deal for us, for real.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Okay. But four years later, The Rock just like the rest of the country has regrets.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNSON: Am I happy with the state of America right now? Well, that answer is no. Do I believe we're going to get better? I believe in that, I'm an optimistic guy and I believe we can get better.The endorsement that I made years ago with Biden was what I thought was the best decision for me at that time. Am I going to do that again this year? That answer is no.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Is The Rock voting for Trump? We don't know, but he's not endorsing anyone. This may have something to do with The Rock being on the board of directors for the UFC and WWE parent company. And since that audience is ultra-MAGA or maybe he's just sick of his buddies busting his chops for the last four years for the worst endorsement ever.Actors like The Rock, being a Democrat hurts you at the box office. Look at Tom Cruise, stayed out of politics. That was a smart business decision. But when the media found out about The Rock on Fox News, sad.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNSON: And now, it is just division.JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": So a couple of questions, first of all --(BOOING)BEHAR: Should celebrities publicly endorse public figures?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Taylor Swift, ball is in your court.Actor Dean Cain joins me now. Dean, you're almost as popular as The Rock. Are you going to be withholding an endorsement?DEAN CAIN, ACTOR: I never withhold an endorsement because I'm not that smart, Jesse.

Thank you.CAIN: In California, we wouldn't even get out of bed. We wouldn't get out of bed.WATTERS: Thank you very, very much.CAIN: Definitely climate change.WATTERS: Thank you. Definitely climate change. I would agree.So Rock is basically -- what is he? $20 million? $30 million a movie. Everybody wants him in the film. Everybody wants him on their show. He regrets the last endorsement.What significance do you see in the non-endorsement un-endorsement Rock situation?CAIN: Well, I love The Rock like everybody else, he is fantastic I want to congratulate my brother, Will Cain on getting that interview. It's great.The Rock basically said this. Look, I effed up last time. You know, this administration sucks. Everybody knows it. That's the way it is. I'm catching a lot of flak from my guys, whether it's Dana White, and UFC guys or whoever, and he's going to -- he is just going to be political. And I get it, I understand it. He is just going to sell his movies. He's going to sell his football league, he's going to sell his WrestleMania and he's going to sell his tequila because he's a businessman.Now, Jesse, I would never come on your show and try to sell anything like this shirt right here, Dean Cain: All-American Lawman," my brand new graphic novel that's coming out. Right now, it is actually sold out. You can go into BigManComics.com and get your own.WATTERS: How do you not have a tequila company, Dean? I mean, what's going on?CAIN: I am working on it.WATTERS: Of course. Everybody has --CAIN: I am drinking enough tequila where I should have my own.WATTERS: Everybody -- I agree. Dean Cain. Thank you so much and thanks for calling me a wimp for experiencing my first earthquake ever.I'm going to go back and hide in the corner.CAIN: You did well. You did well.WATTERS: Thank you very much.

Instead of walking out on Bill, Hillary played the doting wife and claimed any rumors about her husband's bad behavior was just a right- wing conspiracy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER US SECRETARY OF STATE: The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The vast right-wing conspiracy, it was a deflection to distract the American people from what was really going on, and for a while it worked.Since then, the Democrats and the media have perfected it. They've decided that any conversation they don't like, can be explained away as a right- wing conspiracy.Take squatting. "The Washington Post" just put out a piece this week, saying squatters have become a right-wing talking point. Squatting is extremely rare, according to experts, so rare that there is no reliable data available on the number of squatters across the country.But with a handful of high profile cases, property owners go into court to evict illegal residents, a right-wing media frenzy and the introduction of state bills, the topic has become ubiquitous.Now, what qualifies as a right-wing media frenzy? Well, to "The Post," that would be any question asked by our very own stupid son of a bitch, Peter Doocy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: How worried do Americans need to be about squatters?KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: My understanding is that this is obviously a local issue. We are certainly tracking that issue.The rights of property owners and renters must be protected.Ultimately, this is a local issue, and it is critical that local governments take action to address it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Riddle me this, Binder.

You just caught me deeper every year. I was thinking about the blue dress, the stain, all of it.I've got so many things to react to before you even need to ask me a question, Jesse.WATTERS: All right.TRAVIS: Let me start here with which media outlet -- I want you to flag this, you and your producers, which media the outlet will be the first to go this way, right?The first thing they say is, I jotted it down. It isn't happening. Then they go to, okay, it's happening, but it's not happening very often. The next step, which media outlet will be the first to do this one? Why squatting is a good thing.There will be a headline, I promise you, in the next couple of weeks, one of the media outlets will say yes, squatting is real. Yes, it's happening and it is actually a very good thing. That is where we are headed.And we can set odds right now, it will be "The Washington Post," "The New York Times," Daily piece, Media Matters --WATTERS: Can I one up you? I want to do a parley. Okay. Well, who is going to say this?TRAVIS: Yes.WATTERS: Who's going to say if you're against squatting, you're racist.TRAVIS: Oh, yes, and sexist and homophobic and also against illegal immigrants. The other thing I want to say, the Fani Willis segment, that was an A+ segment. I can't even believe that's real.I have two questions for you.WATTERS: Yes.TRAVIS: One be honest. The where is Belize bikini is kind of hot. Like, I think I would be happy to give that to my wife on vacation. Number one. I thought that was a pretty good one.WATTERS: Yes.TRAVIS: Second part here, if you walked into a bedroom, if you are a man, and someone had Fani Willis sheets on their bed, is there any better sign that you better get your ass out of that bedroom fast? Maybe like 25 different pet snakes?I don't know what would have to be in the bedroom that would make me get out of there faster than Fani Willis bedsheets, and if you just had an affair with a man that you hired, would your thought be, let's draw more attention to the bed?WATTERS: Yes, I don't know if bedsheets was the best item to sell at the Fani store. We have some other items we'd like to show you, Clay, if you will just allow us a moment.TRAVIS: Yes.WATTERS: This was Jesse Watters on Easter. I want to show you how to wear a blazer. If we have that image up. This is the proper way to rock, some would say a flamboyant color.TRAVIS: Yes.WATTERS: And we also had a guest on last night, Jonathan Choe who pulled off a burgundy blazer with the silk pocket square and the paisley tie. And we thought you just needed some inspiration.TRAVIS: Well, first of all, I don't want to take a shot at this gentleman. But if you pull that shot up, I don't know why the tie there is so much skinnier than the actual tie itself.I think, humbly that's a really bad look as a fashion maven like I am, I don't know --WATTERS: I've never seen you wear a tie, Clay.TRAVIS: . that's popular there. I don't do ties. They're really just nooses upside down. I don't think it's a good look for any man in the modern era.WATTERS: Okay.TRAVIS: A tie is racist, I've always thought.WATTERS: If I send you -- I'm going to send you a Fani Willis tie. Will you put that around your neck?TRAVIS: I will wear that. That's actually a great idea. You guys give me a Fani Willis tie, I will break my usual anti-tie hiatus and I will wear it on your show the next time.WATTERS: And we're going to throw in a where's Belize bikini just for free because we love you.Clay Travis, have a great weekend.TRAVIS: Thank you. Have a good weekend as well.WATTERS: Meet the number one lawyer in America.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: PRIMETIME got a firsthand look at Seattle's migrant crisis yesterday. The city told them they have no more dinero to pay for their free hotel rooms. They overstayed their welcome and it was time to go.But the ungrateful guests along with liberal activists took over a high school tennis court, and when investigative journalist, Jonathan Choe went there to check it out. They freaked out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHOE: They're essentially extorting the city. They're saying, look, if they don't get money, if they don't get resources, if they don't get motels, they're going to stay. They're going to protest. They're going to create again, you know, chaos.What an attitude of entitlement.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now this isn't a new issue. Last month, radical migrant activist bum rushed a city council meeting, demanding free housing. Six were arrested.

Yes.CHOE: Is she innocent or guilty?MUELLER: She's innocent, of course.CHOE: She is innocent. Okay. Well, she is caught on video being arrested and protesting and allegedly protesting. So I'm trying to get all sides, so I'm like --MUELLER: My client has pled not guilty.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: I know what you're thinking. She's only 70. How does she do it?PRIMETIME is a big advocate of eating healthy. You know, when you eat well, you feel well, you feel well, you live well. But when you chow down on junk food and sugary drinks, it could lead to high blood pressure, obesity, and now we're finding out it could lead to cancer.A new study by the American Cancer Society claims that cancer cases will shoot up by nearly 80 percent by the year 2050. A big part of this is due to diet.Startling prediction, someone should tell Joe Biden who said he'd stop cancer in its tracks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I promise you, if I am elected president, you're going to see the single most important thing that changes America, we're going to cure cancer.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Elect me or I'll -- okay, that's a bold statement. One way to go about is maybe stop complaining the Snickers bars are shrinking and there aren't enough potato chips in the bag.Grace Price's grandpa died of cancer a few years back. The experience got her thinking, am I next? What can I do to prevent myself from getting cancer? And why do we only treat cancer we are diagnosed with it? Why don't we take preemptive measures to stop ourselves from getting it in the first place? The answer? Money.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRACE PRICE, CREATOR, CANCER: A FOOD-BORNE ILLNESS: In the past, the American Cancer Society has accepted a $1.9 million fund from Coca-Cola. This is with the knowledge that the overconsumption of sugar can lead to increased risk of obesity and cancer.The American Heart Association accepts funds from Kellogg's and Coke. The American Diabetes Association accepts funds from Coke The list goes on.The easiest way to understand why certain products are promoted as healthy is to follow the money.Ninety-five percent of the 2020 US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee had a conflict of interest with the Big Food and Big Pharma.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now if you've been watching PRIMETIME, you know how bad this junk food stuff is.Grace Price, her documentary shows you the truth.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRICE: The average American adult consumes around 17 teaspoons of added sugar each day. This is two to three times greater than the healthy amount.The modern killer today is the average American diet.Fruit Loops, granola bars, Frappuccinos, ketchup, bagels, chips, Coke, Capri Sun, Twinkies, muffins, Snickers, crackers, pancakes, yogurt, pizza, pasta, Pepsi, and the list goes on.It's time to wage a war against the toxic foods that have silently infiltrated our diets. The choice is yours.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Grace Price is the creator of Cancer: A Food-Borne Illness.Grace, are you claiming that high levels of sugar and heavily processed junky food actually leads to possible cancer?PRICE: Well, Jesse, I can tell you one thing for sure, which is that it's time to call Big Food out on their sweet lies. We are seeing cancer in huge amounts now in young adults and people who are my age.And as a teen myself, I am not surprised because sugar is the new cigarette for cancer when it comes to my generation. We are the ones buying Frappuccino, snacking on cereals, and eating sugar all day and then told to just take Ozempic as a quick fix. It's so wrong.Coca-Cola funds millions to national health organizations like the American Cancer Society to try to convince us that their high fructose corn syrup filled foods aren't going to make us sick. We know that's not true. And we also know that cancer cells have a massive appetite for sugar.So I'm here to fix this.WATTERS: So back in the day, we didn't have these types of levels of cancer diagnosis, we just didn't. It does seem that cancer is really spreading everywhere. More and more people are getting diagnosed all the time.Is it just in your research because of diet? Or are there other factors?PRICE: Well, what I can tell you is, I decided to go in a deep dive on this and I found that everything aligned with all of the sugar and ultra- processed foods that we have been consuming. As cancer rates have been increasing, so have those things and especially in unprecedented amounts in my generation.Greater than 67 percent of our diet comes from these ultra-processed foods which are filled with sugar and bad oils that we have studies that show are linked to cancer.WATTERS: What happens when you go and get one of those double Frappuccino espresso mocha things from Starbucks and we're not accusing Starbucks of giving everybody cancer, but how much sugar is in that thing.PRICE: I think the last time I checked it was 36 grams but if I'm being quite honest with you, I never order those and I'm trying to encourage other teens not to, so I'm expanding on to TikTok and other platforms for this, but thank you for having me, Jesse.WATTERS: All right, thank you so much, and everybody go check out her documentary. We appreciate it.Sink or Swim is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Sink or Swim, let's bring in Guy Benson, who was supposed to be on "Outnumbered," but got bumped because of the earthquake.GUY BENSON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Breaking news.WATTERS: And Madison Alworth who has been bragging that she's undefeated on this segment.
