LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Always stay connected with us and make sure to follow me on social media. There is a fun little poll question up there on Facebook and I want to see how you answer it.All right, thank you for watching. Remember it is America now and forever.Jesse takes it from here.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]JOE BIDEN, THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hey, you may cut me, man, but I'm going to wrap this chain around your head.WATTERS: Illegal aliens assaulting cops and flipping America the bird. Where's Mr. Tough Guy?[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA): When a Walgreens leaves a neighborhood, they disrupt the entire community. They are life threatening acts of racial and economic discrimination.WATTERS: The squad says avoiding crime is racist.PRESSLEY: Shame on you Walgreens.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I enjoy looking like a clown. I don't abide by gender. I'm [bleep] built different.WATTERS: Quit clowning around. It's DEI Thursday.Plus --JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: What are you guys nervous about?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Politics are kind of [bleep].UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We might end up in a civil war.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I got fat in rehab once.WATTERS: The greatest trash talkers have one thing in common, they back it up. Take Muhammad Ali.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MUHAMMAD ALI, FORMER PROFESSIONAL BOXER: . murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick. I'm so mean I make medicine sick.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: If you have a big mouth, you better have a big punch and Ali did.Teddy Roosevelt didn't always speak softly. Telescope Teddy said William McKinley had no more backbone than a chocolate eclair. Truman said Eisenhower doesn't know any more about politics than a pig knows about Sunday.And then there's Joe Biden, who for 50 years has pretended he's the Ric Flair of Washington.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN (1988): I'd be delighted to sit down and compare my IQ to yours if you'd like, Frank.BIDEN (2017): You may cut me, man, but I'm going to wrap this chain around your head.BIDEN (2020): You're full of [bleep]. Gimme a break, man. Don't be such a horse's ass.BIDEN (2019): You're a damn liar, man. You want to check my shape, let's do pushups together, man. Let's do -- let's run. Let's do whatever you want to do.BIDEN (2018): If we're in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But Biden un-affectionately known as the paper tiger of Wilmington disappears when the bell rings.Biden has taken a knee more than Kaepernick -- China, the squad, the mullahs, his own son. But Washington's biggest talker lost his tongue when the cartels arrived.A gang of migrants broke into the country, pummeled two NYPD officers and while walking out of jail without bail, flipped the double bird to the country that let them in.The two birds heard around the world. The symbol of the Biden presidency right there. The whole migrant gang gave it to us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: [Bleep] you. [Bleep] you.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The free iPhones, hotel rooms, and culturally appropriate meals weren't good enough. They wanted to kick cops in the face and get away with it just like Black Lives Matter.Call me crazy, but making American students take Zoom classes from home so migrants could sleep at their school may have sent the wrong message.Letting criminals walk into your house and walk all over you, we deserve the double bird.Illegal Latino gangs beating up cops and the DA Alvin Bragg didn't ask for bail. The gang isn't even being deported. It's a sanctuary city. Mi casa es su casa.Half the gang has already skipped town on a free bus to California so they won't face charges. Maybe they're heading to California for free sex changes.Joe Biden assured us his border policy was the humane way to operate. What's humane about letting migrants kick cops and vanish? The past three years has been nothing but a middle finger to America.Foreign national storming the beaches of San Diego like its Normandy. Look at this. Boatloads of strange men breaching our beaches and just disappearing into the streets. Not a single other country permits this, except us.America's biggest enemies aren't just sending fentanyl and spy balloons. They're sending brigades of migrants with smiles plastered all over their faces because they know there's no resistance.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: China?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: China.REPORTER: China?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: China.REPORTER: China?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: China.REPORTER: Ecuador? Ecuador?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: China. Hi.REPORTER: Hi. China?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: China.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: China.REPORTER: China? China. China? China? Brazil?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Russia.REPORTER: Okay.Where are you from?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Kazakhstan.REPORTER: Kazakhstan. You?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Georgia.REPORTER: Okay, where are you from? Russia, okay.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Did you hear those Russians? Biden won't let Russia walk into Ukraine but he lets them walk into California. They're letting the third world come in to pick crops, have babies, become citizens and vote. That's their words, not mine, and we've played you the tapes.Now, a president who treats his country like this doesn't love it. You protect what you love, you cherish what you have. You don't subject it to unwanted waves of mysterious men who kick cops and give us the finger. What about the people who are already here? We're not worth protecting?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What about the people that are already here that don't have homes? That don't have jobs? That are sleeping on the street already?These people came from the airport here, probably on boats, probably on buses, and probably all for free. Now, they're getting stipends. They're getting what else?I need money for me and my kids and I was born here. They want to turn our children to animals. They want our children to be bad and eff up.We want better for our community. But this right here is going to be a [bleep] show and it's going to be crazy.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden is destroying America. Keisha says, How does the man the media tells us has empathy, not feel a thing for his own people? Why does he feel more for foreigners than he feels for us?You break into our country, you get handed cash now. Cash debit cards for every migrant who crosses. They come in little envelopes. There's an ATM at Biden's border and it's coming out of the Treasury.Foreign aid is supposed to go to foreign countries. It's not supposed to go to reward foreigners for invading.Biden is surrendering our sovereignty and showering migrants with presents like he is Santa Claus and he is not even checking who is naughty or nice.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANTHONY BEALE, CHICAGO ALDERMAN: The people that are coming here, we don't know if they have criminal backgrounds. We don't know if they are child molesters. We don't know if they're murderers. We don't know.We don't know anything concrete about the people coming here. Now, when you look at what's happening, Venezuela are emptying their jails and telling them to walk to the border.So they're coming to Chicago. We already have enough crime here in the city of Chicago.Now, I've said this before. If you give me three meals, housing, childcare, education, a voucher for $9,000.00, you know what? I'll come to Chicago, too.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Me too. I mean, do you know how much $9,000.00 is to a Venezuelan? You hand that guy nine grand and he's a Venezuelan billionaire. What kind of President hands out cash to foreign nationals and then sics IRS agents on American waitresses for their cash tips? Who does that?You ever heard of a banker who unlocks the door to a stick up man? That's Biden.Democrats thought they were voting for not Trump, but they got the middle finger instead. Soft on crimes compassionate, according to Democrats because yesterday 150 House Democrats voted not to deport illegal aliens arrested for drunk driving.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-IL): This bill designed to scapegoat and denigrate immigrants will not solve the serious problem of DUIs. The bill says that a conviction for a single DUI offense, misdemeanor or felony makes you instantly deportable and an admission to such an offense makes you instantly inadmissible. No questions asked, and I hope my colleagues will stop referring to people as "illegals." People are human beings.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Break into the country, kick cops, drive drunk. Hey, you get to stay. Here's nine grand.Jose can knock back six cervezas, plow his unregistered and uninsured jalopy into your truck, walk out of jail, no bail. No show at the arraignment and head to California for a free sex change? And you can't deport him because he's a human being?Barack Obama deported millions of human beings and the left called him Black Jesus. None of this makes any sense.And by the way, we reached out to Mothers Against Drunk Driving to see if they were mad about this. They didn't get back to us. They didn't care about Pauly P driving drunk either, so not surprised.Oh, and 155 House Democrats just voted against deporting illegals who commit Social Security fraud. So you can break into the country, steal my grandma's Social Security number, open up a credit card in her name, buy a flat screen, get caught, kick the cop in the face, get bailed out, give me the finger and drive drunk to California for a free sex change.Biden won't arrest that hombre, but he wants to put Trump in prison for life.Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders joins me now.Governor, why is it so hard to deport people who don't belong here who kick cops and drive drunk and steal my grandma's Social Security number?GOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R-AR): Because we have a president who absolutely doesn't care that millions and millions of people are coming across our border illegally. He has the power to shut the border down to stop it, he can reinstate the remain-in-Mexico policy. He could actually build the wall. There are a lot of things that he could be doing, and this simply is a complete and total failure by this administration.In the state of Arkansas alone, we seized enough fentanyl in the last year to kill every single person in our entire state. That's nearly three million people. Every man, woman, and child enough fentanyl, just in this state alone. It is an absolute disgrace what this president is doing and it is another great example, while in November, he has to go, and Donald Trump has to be put back in place so we can secure our border and get our country back.WATTERS: Do you think Joe Biden loves this country?SANDERS: If he did, he certainly wouldn't be trying to destroy it second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour. But that's exactly what he's doing. He's allowed our economy to drop, he's allowed our border to completely collapse.Our enemies certainly don't fear us. Our allies don't respect us.Literally every single thing he does, is at the destruction and demise of the people in this country. And I think it is, frankly totally disgraceful and disqualifying for him to be president of the United States if he cannot do the simple job of securing our border, either at the south or the north.WATTERS: I don't know if you're aware of this, Governor, because you're so busy governing, but your name has popped up a couple of times as someone that Trump might be considering as VP. Would you be open to that?SANDERS: Like you said, I'm pretty busy governing here in Arkansas. I absolutely love my job, and I hope that I have the opportunity to do it for the next seven years. I'm going to do everything I can to help President Trump get elected, but I'm really happy back home at Arkansas right now.WATTERS: Okay, I'm not sure how I'm interpreting that, that answer confused me, but I guess it was politically well said.Governor, thank you very much.SANDERS: Thanks, Jesse, for having me on.WATTERS: Well, Gavin Newsom caught on tape. We have it.And Johnny talks to Generation Z.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Are you proud to be Gen Z?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Gen Z has a lot going for us.BELISARIO: Like what?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, actually, maybe I'll retract that statement.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Uh-oh. Fani is in trouble again.Videos from her past coming back to haunt her. It turns out when she was running for DA back in 2020, her opponent was accused of sleeping with employees and stealing money. So what did Fani campaign on? Not having sex with employees and not stealing money.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FANI WILLIS, FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY: The people of Fulton County deserve the very best because they deserve a DA that won't have sex with his employees, because they deserve a DA that won't put money in their own pocket when it should go to benefit children.I certainly will not be choosing people to date that work under me. Let me just say that. I think that what citizens are really, really concerned about is if you chose to have inappropriate contact with employees. I mean, there's nothing that I can say on it other than it is distracting. It is certainly inappropriate for the number one law enforcement officer in this state.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Promises made. Promises not kept.Gavin Newsom was caught on camera sounding like a Karen. The governor was telling some California mayor a story about when he was shopping at Target and spotting a shoplifter. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): Some guy walks out and dropped something my 14- year-old says sir, you dropped this and he comes back. He picks it up and keeps walking out. As we're checking out, the woman says, oh, he's just walking out. He didn't pay for that. I said, well, why don't aren't you stopping him?And she goes, oh, the governor. Swear to God, true story, on my mom's grave. The governor lowered the threshold. There's no accountability. There's no -- I said, that's just not true. And she goes, I said, we are the 10th toughest. Ninety hundred fifty dollars, the 10th toughest in America. She didn't know what I was talking about.And I said, it is just not true. They are still stopped. She said, well, we don't stop them because of the governor, and then she goes, she looks at me twice. And then she freaks out. She calls everyone over. Wants to take photos. I'm like, no, I'm not taking a photo. We're having a conversation. Where's your manager? Hopefully all the reporters were not on for that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Yes, some of the reporters were on. So Newsom needs to speak to your manager because the lady at the register didn't recognize him or because he wonders why he is paying for stuff and other people can steal it for free. That's kind of what we're all wondering, Gavin. It's like that show, "Undercover Boss."Remember? The CEO secretly works at his company to see what it's like and finds out the employees kind of hate him.("UNDERCOVER BOSS" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Corporate is always watching, always watching.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's like a pain in the ass.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, yes. They're constantly here. And it's not just me that thinks the VP of the company is intimidating. Everyone is afraid of her.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Great idea for Democrats, just go undercover and see what their policies do firsthand. Newsom could do that. Throw in a little wig and a visor, walk the state and disguise -- homeless camps, drugstores, courthouses. Once he steps on the needle, notices the dental floss needs to get locked up or his car gets jacked. Maybe he'll wake up.Cashier said it perfectly: No accountability. Something goes wrong, politicians blame someone else.Stores in neighborhoods are shutting down everywhere. Shoplifting is putting them out of business. A Walgreens in squad member Ayanna's Pressley's district went under, high crime neighborhood. So what does Pressley do? She calls Walgreens racist.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESSLEY: These closures are not arbitrary and they are not innocent. They are life threatening acts of racial and economic discrimination.Shame on you, Walgreens. Walgreens is a multibillion dollar corporation that needs to put their money where their mouth is and stop divesting from Black and Brown communities.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The gentlewoman's time has expired.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Pressley needs to look at the root cause here, shoplifting, same story everywhere. Walgreens is scared to say shoplifting is why they're closing, but we know what's going on.Walgreens isn't a welfare agency that can just hand out free toiletries, they're a business. They don't owe you anything. They have employees and customers they need to worry about. It's a business decision. If you want to keep stores open in the neighborhood, keep crime out.DC now carjacking capital of the country. Kids are doing it, running wild, but the politicians say arresting them isn't the answer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRIAN SCHWALB, WASHINGTON, DC ATTORNEY GENERAL: We, as a city and a community that need to be much more focused on prevention and surrounding young people and their families with resources if we want to be safer in the long run, we cannot prosecute and arrest our way out of it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: You heard it, arresting does not stop crime. Just like walls don't stop migrants and lockdowns don't hurt kids.Sonnie Johnson is the host of "Sonnie's Corner" on Sirius XM, Sunny. Sonnie, so if Walgreens stayed and continued to let their African-American employees get robbed and assaulted, that means they're fighting racism.SONNIE JOHNSON, HOST, "SONNIE'S CORNER," SIRIUS XM: First and foremost, Happy Black History Month.WATTERS: Yes, you as well, and happy DEI Thursday.JOHNSON: We want to start February right.Yes, I know I'm here.When it comes to looking at what's happening, as far as the Walgreens situation, I don't understand what they are mad about, right? They are literally Democratic socialists. They hate capitalism.So here they have a victory where they have actually driven capitalism out of an area and instead of saying, okay, we have claimed this victory, we've climbed this mountain. Let us come in now and show you what it is like to be serviced by a Democratic socialist, and bringing in food and medicine and paying everybody $25.00 an hour and covering their healthcare and giving them three months off sick time, and all of these other wonderful things that they expect every other company be able to do. Come and show us how it is done.This is the perfect opportunity for you to show capitalism bad, capitalism racist, democratic socialism, look how we serve you. Look what we can do for you and give us that example, but they can't, and rather than -- and because they can't, what we're starting to see and what Black America is starting to recognize in droves, is that maybe the problem isn't the capitalism, maybe it's the politicians and the policies that they're pushing opposing that.WATTERS: That is such a brilliant point. I wish I had thought of it myself. So what about Gavin? Should he go undercover? And if he does, what kind of costume should he wear?JOHNSON: Gavin Newsom is worrying about 2024. After they beat him, he got on his reparations commission, he should be. So this is him trying to cover for every -- all the faults that they have and not take any responsibility for what is going on in California.And he can say that is the responsibility of the mayors and in some instances, he is right, but he is the leader in that state, ideologically- wise, and they follow his lead. So what you are seeing is a manifestation of his ideology and again, he doesn't want to take credit for it when it's successful.WATTERS: Right. Typical politician.Happy Black History Month, Sonnie. Behave yourself when you're celebrating.JOHNSON: Thank you. Always you know legacy represents well.WATTERS: Beautiful.Well as we said, it is DEI Thursday. Right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Last year we told you about the Democrat Senate staffer who was caught shooting a gay porn in the Capitol, not just anywhere in the Capitol, the Hart Senate Hearing Room where some of the most dramatic testimonies are held.Unfortunately, we were forced to watch a smidgen of the tape, but can't air it and in a rare display of generosity, Gutfeld is sharing his team's sketch of the gay romp. The first time Greg's ever been helpful, and it gives me a sketch of gay porn.Today, the Capitol Hill Police announced wannabe porn star, Aidan Czeropski will not be charged with a crime. They closed this investigation faster than the White House cocaine investigation. Aidan, the Democrat porn star and his German lover boy were uncooperative with investigators and there was no evidence that a crime was committed according to Capitol Police.Did the Capitol police need me to show them the gay porn because that's the evidence? My staff then Googled DC public indecency and in 30 seconds found the crime: It is unlawful for a person in public to make an obscene or indecent exposure of his or her genitalia or anus, to engage in masturbation or to engage in a sexual act.A person who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not more than the amount set forth in prison for not more than 90 days or both.Now, just because you close the door doesn't mean it's not in public, it is the Capitol Building. It's a public building that's open to the public and paid for by the public. How can you walk through the Capitol on January 6 and get charged with crimes, but you can shoot a gay porn in the Capitol on December 6th and not get charged?Because justice isn't blind in America anymore. Justice now sees color, gender, political party, and sexual orientation. So we're no longer equal under the law and it is kind of hard for the government to stay out of our bedrooms when you're making the government the bedroom.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AL SHARPTON, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: And we'll be doing this on a weekly basis. DEI is something we must have.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday, PRIMETIME's favorite day of the week in honor of Reverend Al Sharpton, we're bringing you the best stories about diversity, equity, and inclusion.First up, Colby College in Maine is offering students antiracist tap dancing classes. The course called Critical Race Feminisms and Tap Dance serves as an introduction to critical race theory and the art of tap dance.Tap dancing is racist, we never knew. Apparently Dr. Jill knew. It is how she celebrated Christmas.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]WATTERS: Harvard University thought it was off the hook after they demoted former president, Claudine Gay, but they've gotten another plagiarism scandal on their hands. Say hello to their DEI chief, Dr. Sherri Charleston.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. SHERRI ANN CHARLESTON, HARVARD UNIVERSITY, DEI CHIEF: Hello, I'm Dr. Sherri Ann Charleston and I'm the chief diversity inclusion officer here at Harvard University. The dissertation is only and will always only be a demonstration of your ability to conduct original research.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Original? Well, it doesn't seem like Dr. Charleston took her own advice. She has been accused of committing 40 instances of plagiarism. Where'd she plagiarize most of her work from? Her husband. They share a bond, a bed, and a bank account. Why not share their scholarship?Harvard Diversity Office didn't respond to us. Maybe they're waiting for the husband to respond, we don't know.Now moving on to the wild world of sports.["MEET THE PARENTS" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]WATTERS: Men and women shouldn't play sports together. Rebel News' David Menzies caught wind of a woman's college volleyball game in Canada where there were trans players on both teams. It was chaos.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID MENZIES, REBEL NEWS: Why are you allowing men to play with biological females? Sir, why are you taking away a spot from a real woman?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're not allowed to come here.MENZIES: Don't touch me.PROVOCATEUR: I hope you can go rot in hell. You [bleep] white piece of [bleep].You have a [bleep] vagina. I don't give a [bleep] if you have a vagina.MENZIES: And I think we triggered them.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now Rebel News says one of the actual female players injured during the game, concussion. Now here at PRIMETIME, we ask ourselves a lot of questions. What is a woman? What is the man? And sometimes, what is the clown?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I think that I would like validation for my gender identity. My pronouns are it and they. My gender is none, but I don't want to be associated with gender.I enjoy looking like a clown.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Well, now I'm scared of it. But hey, at least I use the right pronouns.Now, there also are some DEI Thursday victories to report, in Utah, where the state governor said no way Jose to DEI on campus. The new law will prohibit DEI training, hiring, and inclusion programs at universities and in state governments.And in Florida, Disney's lawsuit against DeSantis, dismissed. The House of Mouse claimed DeSantis unfairly retaliated against them after they criticized his parental rights education bill, the judge tossed it.And in Connecticut, high school boys are taking a stand after the school put a tampon dispenser in their bathroom. The new state mandated tampon dispenser was ripped down not even 20 minutes after it was installed.Now PRIMETIME condemns vandalism, but we might need to make an exception for this one.Outkick founder, Clay Travis joins us now.Clay, you seem like the kind of guy in middle school that would have taken down a tampon dispenser in the boys' room.CLAY TRAVIS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: There's so many of these stories that I've got to react, too, Jesse.First of all, I can't even imagine what people would have done if there have been a tampon dispenser. If there was a condom dispenser in a bathroom back in the day, people lost their minds.WATTERS: Oh, yes.TRAVIS: Remember, like sex toys they would sell in like kind of trashy grocery stores and everything else. But let me just hit on the Harvard guy. Can you imagine, Jesse, the poor bastard that's married to a woman that plagiarized him? I saw that story and I just can't even imagine how awkward that must be for him.You said he hadn't issued a statement, yes, because he wants to stay alive. Can you imagine what that lifestyle is like right now?WATTERS: Oh my gosh.TRAVIS: You don't ever want to be on the wrong side of your wife. You know, happy wife, happy life and then it comes out that she stole her entire academic career from you. That guy might just have to get divorced to avoid ever having to have that conversation.WATTERS: Oh, boy.TRAVIS: So I can't believe that. And also, Jesse.WATTERS: Yes.TRAVIS: I think you and I could be incredible women's volleyball players.WATTERS: Oh, the best.TRAVIS: We are both pretty tall.WATTERS: Yes.TRAVIS: I think we could dominate a lot of different women's basketball teams. I mean, volleyball teams out there. I saw this highlight.I feel like you and I are better than most of those dudes pretending to be chicks already. We should take them on. We should kick their ass.WATTERS: Let's challenge them. We'll set it up in Central Park. I'll have Johnny official it.TRAVIS: Yes.WATTERS: And we'll keep score. We'll film it and then we'll air it on JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME next Thursday. Sound good?TRAVIS: I'm in. We will wreck them. We will destroy them. Central Park, everybody can come watch.WATTERS: The more concussions, the better.TRAVIS: Including that poor bastard who is married to a woman that stole from him that is probably looking for something to laugh at because he doesn't have any ability to even speak about anything right now.WATTERS: He might not have anywhere else to go if you know what I mean.TRAVIS: That's right.WATTERS: Clay Travis, thank you very much. Got a got a real sexy shirt. No blazer, but he brought the heat with the shirt. Thanks, Clay.TRAVIS: I'm in Miami. Hey, I'm ready. This is the Miami look.WATTERS: All right, Miami, Clay is in Miami. Just stay inside tonight. Don't go outside, all right. Do not accept drinks from this man. Thanks, Clay.Biden's economy is now packing people into tiny homes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: The American economy is roaring.STEPHANIE RUHLE, NBC NEWS: They've got a good economy. They're not going to say it is a bad economy. It's a strong one, they have got to start running a victory lap.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden shouldn't be running a victory lap or even running for re- election because he's put a bullet in the head of the American Dream. What does that mean? Well, you get gouged for tuition and spit out with six figure debt around your neck.Then you move into a filthy crime ridden city overrun by migrants and protesters or you move back in with your parents in can't score because you live with your parents.If you're a girl, guys won't put a ring on it because they're on dating apps with too many options and inflation is eating away at your paycheck so it's tough to save for a down payment on a starter home. Can't even afford a starter home because rates are so high.And you're single and renting into your 30s or you're married and renting into your 30s, not easy to build a family in an apartment.Now when I was coming of age, mortgage rates were three percent and fixer upper starter homes with three to four bedrooms in decent neighborhoods were within reach.The American Dream today is downsizing. People are buying teeny homes. It's so easy you can even get them on Amazon. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I bought a [bleep] house on Amazon.A house, a whole house on Amazon. [Bleep].All I am going to say is goodbye [bleep] house. The house was originally $24,000.00, after tax and everything, it came out to twenty six.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Teeny homes are about 25 grand, 300 square feet, like the size of a studio apartment plopped into the suburbs. Now when the teeny home gets shipped to you, all you have to do is unfold it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No freaking way. Yo, it's legit.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's like a --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It looks kind of small.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh my gosh.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, that's cool. It's for my laptop though.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yo. The entire house has to fold out, kind of like a puzzle.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's a whole wall. I've never folded a house together.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: It's like adults building forts. Courtesy of Bidenomics, these teeny homes come with a built-in bathroom and kitchenettes, all you have to do is set up water and electric.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here is the bathroom. It is all set up.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the kitchen area. This is the bathroom. I like about.The ceiling is -- I'm five-eight. So the ceilings are very low, y'all. I'm not going to lie right there.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Americans are living in sheds. What's next? People sleeping in bouncy castles? I swear if Jesse, Jr.'s first house is a tree house, we're going to have a big problem. Let's face it. These are trailers without wheels. And trailers are actually nicer and three times as expensive and can winter in Florida.Imagine taking a girl home to a teeny home? Not happening. Imagine raising a family in a teeny home. No way to hide from the crying baby.The Biden economy is walking on stilts. It's a mirage.Kevin O'Leary is the O'Leary Ventures chairman and Shark Tank investor. What does this symbolize that now starter homes in this economy are 300 square feet.KEVIN O'LEARY, CHAIRMAN, O'LEARY VENTURES: What you're talking about effectively is affordability and this is the outcome of raising rates from three percent in terms of mortgages, all the way past eight and that happened very quickly.And so what's occurred is two things. If you owned a home, you have a mortgage of three percent, you're not going to sell it. So those affordable homes are not coming on the market.If you're going to buy a new one, your mortgage rate is two to three times higher, seven to eight percent. So you end up in a matchbox like that because you can afford that. The average salary in America is $64,000.00.This is a shock to the system as a result, the quiet outcome of what happened with rate hikes.Yes, that's the way it is. You're calling it right.WATTERS: Do you imagine bringing a girl home and you live in a teepee, Kevin? A teepee. It is like nothing. It's just plopping a teepee in the middle of a park and you say that your house. Do you even put up a mailbox? I just feel bad for this generation.We have a generation Z segment coming up right around the corner. I wanted to get your opinion on this Walgreens situation. I don't know if you heard the lady from the squad say that she's mad that Walgreens is leaving her neighborhood because it's just getting attacked by criminals. And they should just stay and lose money in order to what? Keep selling toothpaste to criminals.O'LEARY: So let me give it to you in the economics of retail. Walmart is one of the largest retailers on Earth, the concept of shrinkage that's theft, which for decades was around 1.8 to 2.2 percent, and that's very sustainable if your margins are 15 percent pre-tax.When you go to a city like San Francisco that's turned into a warzone. And your shrinkage goes up to seven, eight, nine percent and you know, your employees are at threat of their lives, it is not worth staying open, because you don't make any money.I mean, you know, there's a lot of social issues around this and politics and everything else. But if you're a retailer and you're responsible shareholders, you're just going to shut it down.And so if you don't have stable policy, and this is going to my theory of, you know, competitive states versus uncompetitive states, part of the metrics of competition is to have safety where people can go to work or shop at a drugstore.In San Francisco, you can't really walk around after seven o'clock. I don't go there anymore. It is effectively a warzone and there are other cities that are turning into the same thing, and it's not really red or blue it's about policy.WATTERS: Yes.O'LEARY: And frankly I think we really have got to think about this, you've got to be safe if you want retailers to spend money and build stores you can't have a situation where all the stuff gets stolen.WATTERS: And it's too bad for San Francisco, you're not going anywhere anymore because you are dropping a lot of bank in that city. I heard about the shopping sprees, the dinners, the hotel rooms. Poor San Francisco.O'LEARY: Jesse, Jesse, let me tell you where you can invest today. And I just did a tour of states like Oklahoma, North Dakota, West Virginia, these are places -- Texas, Florida -- you can make money there.WATTERS: There you go. You can make money there. Not San Francisco. Everything else is shrinking. Shrinkage is no good on multiple levels -- homes, retail, you know what else I'm talking about. Kevin, thank you so much.O'LEARY: Take care.WATTERS: So, who is Gen Z?
