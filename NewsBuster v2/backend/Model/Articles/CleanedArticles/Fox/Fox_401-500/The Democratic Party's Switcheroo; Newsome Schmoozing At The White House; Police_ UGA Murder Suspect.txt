PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: All right, that's us for tonight. I'm Pete Hegseth in for Laura Ingraham. Don't miss "FOX AND FRIENDS" Weekend right on this stage in about 10 hours. We're covering all things South Carolina primary.And then of course watch Brett and Martha 7:00 PM tomorrow night on the Fox News Channel.That's it for "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE." Jesse Watters --JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Is he able to make the case the way that you are? Is he able to do it the way you do with the alacrity, the speed, the command?WATTERS: What's Newsom doing schmoozing at the White House?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You only represent the illegal aliens. You don't care. All you care about is illegal aliens and their vote.WATTERS: New York City turning on AOC.REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Have you had enough?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So if phone records were to reflect if you were making phone calls from the same location as the condo, they'd be wrong?NATHAN WADE, ATTORNEY: They'd be wrong.WATTERS: Not so fast, Fani. PRIMETIME got the phone records.Plus --("AUSTIN POWERS" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)FAT BASTARD, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: Get in my belly.WATTERS: A few weeks ago, PRIMETIME gave Gavin Newsom advice: Throw on a disguise, go undercover, and walk your state. See how your policies are playing out like an episode of "Undercover Boss" and Gavin who never misses a show followed orders.The undercover gov has been everywhere. He went undercover as a garbage man. Even though he borrowed someone else's gloves, Gavin is not afraid to get his hands dirty. He is hauling everything from crates to car bumpers.Gavin went undercover as a landscaper, planting trees at the Redwoods National Park.Gavin went undercover as a fisherman. Clearly confused, Gavin thought he was going to get a rod to hold and then he stared down a salmon. Have you ever seen that kind of focus? The intensity? I can't even imagine what's going on through his mind.Does he feel bad for the fish? Is he wondering how it turns into sushi?But he has got the aviators. Who wore it better?Finally, Gavin went undercover as president. He hosted the Crown Princess of Sweden, where he welcomed her majesty with a warm smile and handshake. Sources tell PRIMETIME that Gavin's camp considered this a coup, because the princess visited him instead of Biden.And now that Gavin has his foreign policy chops after a five-minute meeting with a Scandinavian Royal, he was ready for Washington.Today, Gavin waltzed into the White House and thought he was president. He beelined straight to Mayorkas, gives him the old "how ya doin', little guy" back slap. You doing good, Secretary? Everything good, good little man? How tall are you, anyway? You're cute. I can see my reflection in your head.And then he starts scolding him. Look at him pointing, dressing him down like a kid. He's doing what Biden should have been doing for three years. It's about time Mayorkas got a little tongue lashing. Gavin hadn't looked this much in charge since tobogganing in China.He was there with a bunch of governors, but Biden prepared a special thank you for the governor of California.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are building the nation's first high speed rail line in California and Nevada. And I want to thank Governor Newsom for his leadership on that.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BIDEN: And by the way, I'm not sure how many people will leave LA can do it in two hours to get there and whether they are going to come back or not. Las Vegas.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden didn't stick the landing, but he was getting a little dig in at Gavin, saying people are going to leave LA and never come back.Now, PRIMETIME sensed this tension. As a matter of fact, there's tension rippling through the Democratic Party. Behind-the-scenes, donors are furious that Biden forgets their names.Now imagine raising millions for a politician who you've met a dozen times and when he sees you, he calls you the wrong name, and he needs notecards to answer your questions. That's what donors are moaning about.And you've heard about the Russian political prisoner that Putin murdered? Biden just met his wife and called her the wrong name. Her name is Yulia, Biden called her Yolanda.Yesterday we showed you Biden walking across the tarmac holding Nancy Pelosi's hand for dear life, covering about 50 yards in about a minute-and- a-half. The media needs a xanny every time Biden walks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIMMY KIMMEL, "JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE" HOST: Every time I watch him go down a flight of stairs, I get that same anxiety you get when you're like watching your kid trying to catch a pop fly.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Think about all the time and attention the White House focuses on keeping Biden upright, making sure he's not tired, helping him remember names. That attention should be on us, the American people. This White House should be focused on taking care of you, not an elderly president. The White House just isn't seeing the anger out there, even from their own side. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)YASMIN VOSSOUGHIAN, MSNBC HOST: Is there a pathway forward for you with Biden?FARAH KHAN, ABANDON BIDEN CO-FOUNDER: Oh, absolutely not. You cannot keep killing people with our money and just keep thinking that oh, we are stupid enough to elect you again.VOSSOUGHIAN: If you don't want a Trump presidency then, are you not worried about what he could do domestically to this country?KHALID TURAANI, ABANDON BIDEN CO-FOUNDER: I'm willing to let go of Joe Biden and oppose Joe Biden, make him a one-term president, punish Joe Biden by making him a one-term president.ANNIE WISNER, GRADUATE STUDENT, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: Why does our democracy, why is having a Trump presidency more important than those people's lives? Why is our democracy more important than thousands of men, women and children being killed?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now we know Hunter likes to be punished, but I'm not sure about Joe.A new Gallup poll shows Biden's approval rating has dropped to 38 percent. Now, Gallup is the gold standard, 38 approval in an election year is fatal.Biden has been telling Democrats "watch me" and they have, but is anyone watching what's coming their way?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to show Crooked Joe Biden and the radical left Democrats that we are coming like a freight train in November.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: We're going to win this state and then we're going to tell Crooked Joe Biden, you're fired. Get out of here. You're fired.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now, Biden's a gimpy pony and the press wants to change their bet. CNN is now begging the undercover governor to rip the mask off and run.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: CNN Poll of Polls today finds Biden's average approval rating, his average approval rating is just 39 percent. Voters do not seem to see in President Biden what you see.GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): Yes, I mean, we've got to mind the gap between performance and perception. No doubt about it.TAPPER: Well, is he able to make the case the way that you are?NEWSOM: We all are making the case.TAPPER: But is he able to do it the way you do with the alacrity, the speed, the command --NEWSOM: Well, I was just with him, he's making a case.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now Gavin isn't just being courted, the media is throwing themselves at him and he loves it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Does 81-year-old President Biden have a better chance of beating Donald Trump than you? And do you disagree with 86 percent of Americans who think he's too old to run?NEWSOM: I appreciate the question and the framing, but I also appreciate my president and his performance.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now the party doesn't need the good soldier act anymore. It needs a savior. Russia is winning, rates are still high and the border is worse than ever.Does Dr. Jill have a plan?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE ROGAN, PODCAST HOST, "THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE": Don't you think that that's a ruse? With him running for president?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't think he's going to run?ROGAN: No, no. I think they're going to get rid of him. I think they're going to move him out. They're going to force him to step down. That's what I think.If I had to guess, and it is just speculation, I'd say they're setting up Gavin Newsom for it. That's what I say. That's what I think.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now the Hur report dug the grave and Joe Biden is one fall away from going in. Question is, will anyone push him?Dan Hollaway is the host of "Drinkin' Bros" Podcast. He joins me now.Dan, is Joe Biden going to be the nominee?DAN HOLLAWAY, HOST, "DRINKIN' BROS" PODCAST: Well, that I don't know, but what I do know is that watching him perform on a day-to-day basis kind of feels like watching the movie, "Zoolander." Remember that? The files are inside the computer, they just don't understand how anything works anymore, shouting at the sky.I really don't know. Do you have your cheat sheet with you, Jesse? You know, you're supposed to sit in your seat, right?WATTERS: I am sorry. You know what? You're right. This is Dan Hollaway. Are you going to ask me a question?HOLLAWAY: Oh, boy. And then you know, Gavin's the perfect guy to step in there. He looks like the White rich villain from every Disney movie I've ever seen. Like, could you like make this guy up any worse? Good Lord.WATTERS: Well, I mean, he's basically teed up to take it over. Kamala is not even in the running anymore. What kind of firefight are we going to see on the left if they just leap frog the first female black VP and give it to the guy who's tall, White and handsome?HOLLAWAY: That's a good question, man. I don't know.Honestly, you know, I don't know if you noticed this today, but he kind of like semi-endorsed Nikki Haley for the GOP today, which is pretty interesting.WATTERS: Who did?HOLLAWAY: Gavin Newsom?WATTERS: He did?HOLLAWAY: He said, yes, she would be a better candidate than Trump. She should -- they should go on and on her, yes.WATTERS: Oh, so they're playing games in our primary. We're playing games in their primary. I mean, I guess it's what politics is all about, isn't it?HOLLAWAY: Yes, absolutely. And, you know, speaking of Haley, by the way, I don't know if you've noticed how audaciously she has been playing into the military spouse thing lately, almost to an offensive degree, particularly because, you know, she doesn't have a great track record with that. Listen nimrod, you can't play that card when you cheated on your husband while he was deployed. I'm sorry. You're just done with that forever.WATTERS: Is that even true?HOLLAWAY: Yes.WATTERS: Okay. Not sure if that's true, but it is what it is. Happy Friday, Dan. It seems like you've had a few already. We love you.HOLLAWAY: No, no. Not me.WATTERS: Fox News Alert: Police just announced the suspect arrested for the murder of a nursing student, Laken Riley in Georgia -- not a US citizen.National correspondent, Matt Finn has the latest -- Matt.MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Jesse, tonight, police announced the murder suspect in custody is Jose Antonio Ibarra. He is not a US citizen. Police did not confirm the exact status of the suspected killer, but he is believed to be from Venezuela.The suspect is charged with a long list of crimes including felony murder, murder with malice, kidnapping and hindering a 911 call. Police say, so far the evidence suggests this was a solo act. A few people were taken into custody for questioning, but only one was arrested.'Police say Ibarra is the suspected killer of 22-year-old nursing student, Laken Riley. Riley was a dean's list student attending the Augusta Athens Campus of the University of Georgia.Riley's body was found with visible injuries in the area of Lake Herrick yesterday. That lake is a part of the campus. Riley's friends called police after she did not return home from a run, and now we have this devastating news -- Jesse.WATTERS: All right, thanks so much. Devastating story.FINN: Sure.WATTERS: Ahead, new spy balloons and Fani's booty calls. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Fox News Alert: There is another balloon. The military says it's flying over the western part of the country drifting east as we speak. We have no pictures. Don't know who's behind it or why it's in the sky. Is it Chinese? Probably.But here's what we do know, it's a micro balloon. The payload being two cubic feet about the size of a microwave. The Chinese spy balloon in comparison, 30 feet long, the size of two school buses.We also know it's over 40,000 feet in the air, very similar to the Chinese version. According to NORAD, it's not a threat and it's not maneuverable. But that's what they said last time.We'll continue tracking the new spy balloon and let you know if the President shoots it down.Illegals are being mass released on our streets and bused to a city near you.Bill Melugin is in San Diego with the latest -- Bill.BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Jesse, wild day out here in San Diego. By our count, at least eight Border Patrol buses mass released many hundreds upon hundreds of illegal immigrants to city streets here.We'll get right into that video. Take a look.This is one of the first buses that pulled up earlier today. Again, mostly adults from all around the world released from Border Patrol custody at a trolley station here in San Diego.We talked to people from China, from Senegal, from Mauritania, from Haiti, from Peru, from Afghanistan, Colombia, India, you name it. We probably heard it down here.We didn't meet anybody from Mexico though and take a listen, they are going all over the United States.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(BILL MELUGIN speaking in foreign language.)TRANSLATION: Where you from?MIGRANT: Ecuador.(BILL MELUGIN speaking in foreign language.)TRANSLATION: Ecuador. Where are you going in the United States?MIGRANT: New York.MELUGIN: New York. Going to New York.(BILL MELUGIN speaking in foreign language.)TRANSLATION: Where are you all from?MIGRANTS: Costa Rica.MELUGIN: Costa Rica.(BILL MELUGIN speaking in foreign language.)TRANSLATION: Costa Rica. Where are you going in the United States?MIGRANT: Atlanta.MELUGIN: Atlanta.MIGRANT: New Jersey.MIGRANT: New Jersey.MELUGIN: New Jersey.(BILL MELUGIN speaking in foreign language.)TRANSLATION: Where are you going in the United States.MIGRANT: Chicago.MELUGIN: Chicago.(BILL MELUGIN speaking in foreign language.)TRANSLATION: And where are you from?MIGRANT: Colombia.MELUGIN: Colombia.(BILL MELUGIN speaking in foreign language.)TRANSLATION: Do you want to work?MIGRANT: No.(BILL MELUGIN speaking in foreign language.)TRANSLATION: No? Asylum?MIGRANT: Yes. Yes.MELUGIN: They say they want asylum. They don't want to work.(END VIDEO CLIP)MELUGIN: And Fox news reached out to California Governor Gavin Newsom 's office to get his reaction to these mass releases happening in San Diego, one of his cities. His office responded by blaming Republicans for what they described as chaos at the border.They also added that: "California is a model of partnership for a safe and humane border."We'll send it back to you.WATTERS: Biden could end this today with an executive order. Sources inside the White House says he is thinking about it, plagiarizing Trump's border policy would help him, not sure what he is waiting for because Biden's migrants are at war with the party's most loyal base, Black voters and they're promising to make Jussie Smollett's dream come true -- turning Chicago in to MAGA country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're seeing money just rain out of the skies, to immigrants who have not been here, who haven't paid into the system at all.We're not going to let what we worked for get snatched from us.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are so angry that we are willing and going to turn our backs on the Democratic Party. We're working to turn Chicago red.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: In New York, AOC was giving a speech about climate change. The crowd said, enough is enough. Stop talking about the weather and start deporting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't care. All you care about is illegal aliens and their votes.You don't care about your constituents.OCASIO-CORTEZ: All right, sir. All right, sir. Have you had enough?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You only represent the illegal aliens and (INAUDIBLE).OCASIO-CORTEZ: Well, clearly I don't because I'm an elected member of Congress. So keep it pushing, bro.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Jake Julius is a podcast host and founder of Rattlesnake TV, Jake, does AOC understand what's happening?JAKE JULIUS, PODCAST HOST AND FOUNDER, RATTLESNAKE TV: I don't really think she does, and thank you for having me, Jesse. But I must say, coming from Australia, from an outsider's perspective, I've always looked at New York from the time I was a little kid as the most amazing city, the Big Apple, the Statue of Liberty and dreamed of going there.And as an outsider, I'm pissed off so I can understand why being a New Yorker and especially a generational New Yorker, why you'd be so angry at these policies.WATTERS: When did you come here? And obviously, you came here the right way.JULIUS: Yes, well, I mean, I came here on a plane and came here the right way. But -- and I'm also speaking to immigration lawyers as we speak. So yes, I did it the right way. We've been here for about a month now in Miami.WATTERS: All right, so you've been in this country a month. Has anything shocked you?JULIUS: The only thing that really shocks me to be honest, Jesse, is the fact that Americans will still sell flagellate and whip themselves and say that they're racist, and they're such a White supremacist country.If you go to places like South Korea and Japan, and you see the cultural homogeneity that these countries have and then you try and tell them that we're going to bring busloads of migrants in, illegal immigrants, for that matter and we're going to pay for them and subsidize them. We're going to pay for their food and we're going to pay for their accommodation and give them debit cards. You'll see how the Japanese respond.WATTERS: Why do you think Americans hate themselves and don't really mind letting their borders be overrun?JULIUS: Well, I think it's because generally, it's a culture where people are morally quite good, and we want the best for people and we've always had good cultures.We come from the Christian cultural heritage of turning the other cheek and we come from the Christian cultural heritage that has built the greatest civilizations that the world has ever known.So I think that we are good people, and we want to -- and Australians as well and British for that matter, we want to see people thrive and benefit and unfortunately, sometimes people use it against us.WATTERS: Right. But compassion can also be dangerous, just ask Joe Biden and Hunter. What happened there?Well, I'm glad you're here. Don't get in any trouble on the road, and we'll keep you because we like you.JULIUS: I'll just think -- I'll just think what would Jesse do?WATTERS: That's right. That'll keep you alive. Thanks so much.JULIUS: Thank you.WATTERS: Fani's booty calls, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Last week's feisty court appearance with Fani Willis and Lover Boy was a gift. The world got to witness Fani firsthand and finally noticed what we've been seeing for a long time -- brilliance.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ATTORNEY: Have you been on any of those continents with him? Besides this one?FANI WILLIS, FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Where's Belize? What continent is that? I'm not being funny. I don't know.I think I bought him -- he likes wine. I don't really like wine to be honest with you. I like Gray Goose.ATTORNEY: Has he ever visited you at the place you laid your head?WILLIS: So let's be clear, because you've lied in this -- this -- let me tell you which one you lied in, right here. I think you lied right here.JUDGE: (INAUDIBLE)WILLIS: No, no, no, no. This is the truth, Judge.It is a lie. It is a lie.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: As we suspected, Fani and Lover Boy perjured themselves.Trump's attorneys got their hands on Lover Boy's cell phone data. Lover Boy was asked about that cell phone data, remember?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ATTORNEY: So if the phone records were to reflect that you were making phone calls from the same location as the condo before November first of 2021, and it was on multiple occasions, the phone records would be wrong?WADE: If phone records reflected that, yes, sir.ATTORNEY: They'd be wrong?WADE: They'd be wrong.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Well what reason would he have to visit Fani's condo if they weren't sleeping together?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ATTORNEY: You would have been there as you indicated for many reasons, right?WADE: Yes. She already resided there, went to visit her, maybe went to talk about a document that I received.ATTORNEY: You would go to the condo to talk about a document that you received.WADE: Absolutely.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Oh, so Wade would have just been reviewing documents at Fani's condo. About how many times did Wade review documents?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ATTORNEY: When I say frequent, do you think prior to November 1st of 2021, you were at the condo more than 10 times?WADE: No, sir.ATTORNEY: So it'd be less than 10 times.WADE: Yes, sir.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: What did Fani have to say? Did Lover Boy spend the night?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ATTORNEY: If you would, the Yeartie condo, including Miss Yeartie.WILLIS: Never. This is a very lonely period in my life. I don't think anyone ever spent the night.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Fani lied. Cellphone data prove that Lover Boy visited Fani's condo 35 times that year. Fani and Wade really must enjoy reviewing documents together.Cellphone data also shows Fani and Lover Boy called each other 2,000 times that year and texted each other 12,000 times. Got to be about the documents.But we also have the location data. The private investigator just started his review and already found two booty calls. On September 11, 2021, Wade arrived at Fani's around 10:45 PM and left at 3:28 AM. And when he got home, he texted her. He probably wrote, Fani, I've never reviewed documents like that before. You are the best.On November 29, 2021, Fani called wait at 11:32 PM. He shows up at Fani's at 12:43 AM and didn't leave until 4:45 in the morning, that's four hours of reviewing documents. Attaboy, Wade.So PRIMETIME is excited to hear Fani's alibi. And it can't be it's a Black thing, because it's a White thing, too.Outkick founder, Clay Travis joins us now. What do you think they were doing overnight for hours and hours and hours?CLAY TRAVIS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: First of all, I wore my pink jacket in honor of this true love affair. It is a modern day Capulets and Montagues. Hark, the sun is rising in the distance.I would submit that he might have been examining her fanny. I'm just going to throw that out there, Jesse. I don't know very many legal document reviews that happen from 12:50 to 4:50 in the morning in the condo complex of a woman.Here's the big takeaway, though. I mean, this is scandalous. This is absurd. As you just said, 2,000 phone calls. If someone leaves me a voice message, Jesse, I lose my mind. Send me a text message. And he was doing that too -- 12,000 text messages between the two of them.But here as scandalous and ridiculous as this is, is the big takeaway. They're both going to get removed from this case in Atlanta. I believe that Fani Willis is going to have to get kicked out of the DA's job, even in Fulton County, which we know is often a corrupt municipality.And I think both of these attorneys are going to get disbarred, Jesse, and I say that as someone who is still an attorney barred in good standing so far as I know in two different jurisdictions in this country, and I think they're going to get their own mugshots just like Trump got his mugshot in Fulton County, except unlike the charges they brought against Trump, I think these perjury charges based on the idiocy that they spread and shared on the witness stand, this is why your attorney tells you not to take the witness stand, raise your hand, and say under oath that you promised not to perjure yourself and tell the truth. This is an easy perjury claim. They're dead to rights. I mean, credit to the attorneys here, Jesse.WATTERS: Yes, they are dead to rights in an Honorable courtroom. This judge is --TRAVIS: They clearly had these documents already, and they quizzed them on it.WATTERS: This judge is so soft, Clay.TRAVIS: Yes.WATTERS: I could easily see him not DQing them because he's a pansy, but we'll wait and see.Now, let me ask you this, Clay. Remember when Bill Clinton said "I did not have sexual relations." Fani, all she said was no one ever slept over. Now, if there was no sleeping --TRAVIS: Yes, well --WATTERS: And he left at 4:55 AM, did she perjure herself?TRAVIS: Well, I think look, you also remember Bill Clinton, Yale trained lawyer, very smart guy said in his deposition in the Monica Lewinsky case that depends on what the meaning of the word is, is. I suspect that they will try to defend themselves by saying this wasn't a relationship yet. They were just hooking up.I don't think that's going to fly very well, because as I was saying, I give credit to the attorneys here. They clearly already had these cell phone records and this text message relationship, and they went ahead and aggressively questioned.WATTERS: Right.TRAVIS: It wouldn't be one thing if they said in there, hey, how many times did you go visit and you know, there are a few off, one way or the other; 12,000 text messages is hard to explain away.WATTERS: Well, I mean --TRAVIS: Two thousand phones calls is impossible to explain away.WATTERS: That says to me --TRAVIS: This was a relationship.WATTERS: That says, they were in heat, 12,000 texts, Clay?TRAVIS: Yes.WATTERS: They were in heat. How about when they say, well, what if cellphone records showed otherwise and Wade goes, AT&T cellphone records would be wrong. That's the genius.TRAVIS: Well, I mean, that's the defense.WATTERS: That's prosecuting Trump.TRAVIS: Hey, you and I are roughly the same generation. You remember Shaggy? It wasn't me. Nathan Wade and Fani Willis are basically in the Shaggy defense. They could be on a tape sleeping together and they just be like, not me. You know, maybe that's going to be everybody's defense, to be honest in an AI era, just to argue that everything is made up. Nothing is real.I mean, as far as excuses go, that one might work better than most.WATTERS: I'm just hoping your blazer is AI because that can't be real.TRAVIS: This blazer. This blazer? Did you see? I don't know if you've talked about it yet, Jesse, that Joe Biden said the secret to a good marriage. This is not a joke. It's good sex.This blazer is good sex personified on television. You're welcome, Friday night.WATTERS: I just want to apologize to Clay's wife in advance. It's not going to be four hours.Clay, have a great weekend.TRAVIS: Hey, it ain't going to be four minutes. Trust me.WATTERS: Okay.Meet DC's biggest welfare queen.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Bidenomics is eating young Americans alive. They have no financial independence. They can't get ahead with the cost of living on entry level salaries.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does anyone else just work their ass off for like the last three or four years for like a college degree and now you have a job that you hate and you still can't afford life and you just feel lied to?Because you thought that if you just went to college and got a degree, you'd be able to afford a house, but yet you still barely can afford groceries or clothes, or literally anything that makes you happy at all?And you had to spend the whole entire weekend in your bed because you literally don't have any money to go do anything other -- like if you buy food, you just can't have an entertainment budget.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: No one buys a house straight out of college, but we sympathize. You know, if you pay six figures for a sociology degree from Southwestern, Kentucky State University? You've been scammed. But this young lady is doing the right thing. She's working, budgeting, not asking for handouts.But other young women are getting ahead the old fashioned way -- welfare.Canethia Miller, 27-year-old unmarried mother of three gets food stamps and free housing and just qualified for another program in DC. Strong Families, Stronger Futures is the program and Canethia got nearly 11 grand, lump sum to provide for her young children, and then blew most of it balling out in Miami.She took her family on a $6,000.00 vacay buying all of them new clothes for each day of the trip where they ate steak every night. She bragged that she used more of the money on a mommy makeover so she wouldn't look like a "working mom," which to be fair, she isn't.She is justifying the spending spree saying she taught her kids that if they worked hard, they can live large. She even talked to "The Washington Post": "I wanted to blow it. I wanted to have fun."And it might just seem like it's just $11,000.00, but these programs are everywhere. DC gave this grant to almost 150 people, $1.5 million gone.Emily Wilson, host of "Emily Saves America" joins me now.Emily, think about this answer before you answer it. Who is the sucker here? Is it the college grad who is struggling? Or the welfare queen who is living large?EMILY WILSON, HOST, "EMILY SAVES AMERICA": Well, obviously the girl in the first video, you genuinely have to have sympathy for. You can see this girl did everything she was told. This is what you do to succeed in America, and now, she did it all and she's realizing like, oh, everything I was told is basically a lie.Meanwhile, the second woman has to be best friends with Fani. They got to be on the same itinerary.WATTERS: That's right. I'm sure Wade was in Miami that same weekend. But if you're Washington, DC, and you see this woman who is unmarried, three kids now on her third welfare program, bragging about this lavish vacation off of the money that you just gave her to take care of her children, wouldn't you cut the program?WILSON: Well, yes, you would think you would cut that program. You would think you would, after you see the homeless getting worse and worse, you would cut that program. But you know, the Democrats, I believe funnel it all back into their own pockets, so why would they want to do that?These are the same people that when we got stimulus checks to pay our rent and get food, went out and bought flat screen TVs and Louis Vuitton bags.WATTERS: What about the woman that did go to college and she's struggling at an entry level position? I don't like to usually say this. I always say going to college is a good thing. But now there's a college everywhere. I mean, anybody can start a university. It doesn't matter then they bill you for a degree that's worthless. Are some people better off not going to college?WILSON: Yes, I mean I didn't go to college. I think I am a million times better off. I immediately entered the workforce. I think it prepared me better for life. I wasn't told to hate America and I wasn't coddled all day.
