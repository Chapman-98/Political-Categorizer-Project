They're not yet ready as much as people think.INGRAHAM: No. It's a big waste of time.CORKE: Yes.INGRAHAM: Tomorrow, Super Tuesday coverage. You'll see me, it starts at 7:00 PM. So "The Angle" won't be on, but you'll see me throughout the night for political analysis.Jesse is next.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it's a very big day for America. I think it's a very big day for liberty. It is just a great day for this country.WATTERS: The Supreme Court puts Trump back on the ballot.JEN PSAKI, MSNBC HOST: His so-called migrant crime wave is just not happening. It's a lie.WATTERS: The media says migrants haven't broken any laws.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is devouring them.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Why are your kids sucking toes in school?Plus --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why did the chicken cross the road? Ba-kak.WATTERS: Another body blow to Joe Biden's re-election campaign, which was already having trouble breathing. In a unanimous decision, nine-nothing, the Supreme Court ruled today that states cannot strip Donald Trump off the ballot.Donald Trump will remain on the ballot in Colorado, Illinois, and Maine, and in every state. The ruling states: "States have no power under the Constitution to disqualify a candidate from federal office, especially the presidency."Amy Coney Barrett adding, particularly in this circumstance, writings on the court should turn the national temperature down, not up.Donald Trump called the decision unifying and inspirational and challenged Joe Biden to stop his prosecutors from interfering in the election. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: President Biden, number one, stop weaponization. Fight your fight yourself. Don't use prosecutors and judges to go after your opponent, to try and damage your opponent so you can win an election. Our country is much bigger than that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now the media has been dishonestly selling this case as a slam dunk, raising the hopes of liberals that Biden could win again from the basement because Trump would have been off the ballot in every blue state.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)J. MICHAEL LUTTIG, FORMER FEDERAL COURT JUDGE: Yesterday's decision by the Colorado Supreme Court was masterful. It was brilliant and it is an unassailable interpretation of the 14th Amendment.JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: The Constitution says what it says. The Colorado Supreme Court decided that the Constitution still matters and replies to Donald Trump.CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: The ex-president engaged in insurrection against the United States The Constitution says he is not qualified for office as a result. That is the plain truth of the matter and the straightforward reading of the law.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The great legal minds of cable TV didn't see a nine-nothing ruling coming down the pipeline and gave their audience what they wanted to hear, false hope and eventually disappointment.CNN reported that it was unfortunate that the Supreme Court followed the Constitution.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR AND POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Unfortunately for America, the court isn't necessarily wrong that this is the way the framers wanted it to be.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Unfortunately, for America, the framers wanted freedom of the press and we have CNN. Now, the press today collectively realized Americans would have to vote to save democracy. The Democrats will have to persuade voters instead of nine judges, and they admitted this with a heavy heart.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JENA GRISWOLD (D), COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATE: It will be up to the American voters to save our democracy in November.KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: This means we've got to beat him at the ballot box and that may motivate our base.LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR POLITICS, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: You can't save the people from themselves. If they're determined to reelect him after he organized that insurrection, arguably, our first coup d'etat, then there is nothing to stop the people from doing that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Larry is mad that nothing can stop Americans from voting. They're admitting they don't actually like the democracy that they say they need saving.Now some TV lawyers pretend it was the right decision all along and they knew it was going to be nine-nothing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": And I actually think it was the right decision to make, because it would have -- you know, if Colorado had been allowed to do that, we'd have this chaotic sort of process where you have 50 states and some are choosing to put him on the ballot and some are choosing not to put him on the ballot.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Nah. But this wasn't what Sunny Hostin said months ago about the Colorado case.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOSTIN: Point is the Constitution and there is a Constitution and there's precedent, he needs to be taken out.CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: I understand that --(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Other liberals threw a tantrum worse than Jesse, Jr.Keith Olbermann says: "The Supreme Court has betrayed democracy. Its members, including Jackson, Kagan and Sotomayor have proved themselves inept at reading comprehension, and collectively the court has shown itself to be corrupt and illegitimate. It must be dissolved.The women on the court can't read, so dissolve it says Keith Olbermann, unaware that it happens to be Women's History Month. Someone told Olbermann to cry more, and he wrote back: "Those aren't tears, fascist. They're urine. I'm sure you enjoy being bathed in it."Olbermann claimed he has urinated on his own face and we hope that he gets the help that he needs.Regardless of what Olbermann is doing in the privacy of his own home, the media has officially declared the Democrats, now is the time to start freaking out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLIE SYKES, MSNBC GUEST: If it's an existential threat, let's start acting like it's an existential threat. So stop the bedwetting, but maybe a little bit of freakout wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: POLITICO says behind-the-scenes, this has the feel of a slow motion car crash. The level of freakout remains high as Democrats are telling each other if you're not a bedwetter now, you're not paying attention.They were passing out Quaaludes on the Upper West Side after the Sunday "New York Times" edition landed on the stoops, the latest "Time" poll, Trump is ahead by five points, a gaping advantage by a Republican nationally in a mainstream media poll. The most damning finding, 10 percent of Americans who voted for Biden in 2020 now say they're switching their votes to Trump.That means over eight million Biden voters have become Trump voters, which would give Trump the popular vote, the first time a Republican has done that in 20 years.Joe Biden's approval rating is sinking even lower to just 36 percent and around three quarters of the country agreeing he is too old to be an effective leader.Half of Democrats don't even want Biden to be their nominee and President Trump is taking advantage, picking up large amounts of support from women, Hispanics, Blacks, young Americans, basically everyone besides college professors and ladies with purple hair.The left can't process how horrible of a President Joe Biden is, and the toll he is taking on their party and more importantly, the country, so they're lashing out in uncoordinated fashion, justifying and excusing his performance and giving a variety of wild advice.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: Do I need to remind you that one of the greatest presidents in the history of America was in a wheelchair, and he did okay.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: We went from Biden's FDR because he accomplished a lot to he is FDR because neither could walk.Here's another strategy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAHER: Instead of trying to refute all the too old to be president slams, Joe must embrace them. Stop with the I'm sharper than ever. Nobody is buying that.(LAUGHTER)MAHER: Don't try to deny the age thing. Lean into it. Lean in, lean in like you're eating soup.Just admit it say, yes, I'm bad with names and I walk like a toddler with a full diaper.Be yourself and Joe, yourself is old.(LAUGHTER)MAHER: That's who you are. Oh, you once fell down the stairs at the Underground Railroad. You're so old, you're a bad kid with a drug problem is 54.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: While Democrats disagree over if Biden is FDR, or a baby with a dirty diaper, others suggest, call in the military.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONNY DEUTSCH, MSNBC HOST: And there needs to be a general campaign where these generals who have worked with him need to turn to the American public and turn to camera and say you don't understand how scary this can be. We really can go over a cliff here. Get people -- scare the (bleep) out of people.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So instead of 51 CIA guys, we're going to go 51 generals beating the medals off their chest.How does the Biden campaign plan on closing? Ready? The focus will be overwhelming on democracy. I think the biggest images in people's minds are going to be of January 6.So Biden is not going to run on policy. He is going to run on January 6. And he thinks in November, voters are going to going to be walking to their polling place thinking about the guy who put his feet up on Nancy's desk and the Shaman.Obama world not convinced. David Axelrod says: "I'm pretty certain in Scranton, they're not sitting around their dinner table talking about democracy every night." This is what they're talking about around their dinner table.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't have the money to buy fast food anymore. Who made these prices? Bam. Overnight. It's like, hey, guess what? Your Arby's is 53 bucks. I'm never paying 53 bucks for fast food.One trip at McDonald's right now, one single trip to McDonald's, 30 bucks. $30.00? $30.00? That's -- that's pizza money. You're not pizza. You're fast food.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Attorney for President Trump, Alina Habba joins me now.Alina Are you going to send Keith Olbermann some of those new Trump sneakers?ALINA HABBA, DONALD TRUMP ATTORNEY: I guess I am and I'm going to put them in a case so he can look at them forever. And look at eBay and how they're selling for $450,000.00.WATTERS: What's going on with these people? It's just a crazy reaction to something everybody knew was going to happen.HABBA: You know what it reminds me of, Jesse? Do you remember in 2016 and 2020, and you had these women, they are memes now of them crying when Donald Trump won, just the outbreak.I remember waking up at 2:00 AM and watching liberals just shed liberal tears. That is what's happening. Why? Because America won today.Imagine crying because the Constitution is standing strong, and we're not going to turn into Cuba. That's Trump Derangement Syndrome 101 right there. We're so upset because the Constitution was upheld today, because the Supreme Court showed us that we are not Cuba, we are not a third world country.We are not a Banana Republic, and that the things I've seen over the past four months in New York are not going to become America. And what does MSNBC, "The View" and CNN do? They have tantrums.It's literally epic to watch, but we did say this is a clean cut Supreme Court decision. It is constitutional. They were trying to do something that would have been hurtful to Democrats and Republicans and that's what people need to remember.It's about America First. It's not about Trump, it is about us.MACDONALD: I heard Raskin, the Congressman, Democrat today say he's got some rascally plan to go back to Congress and determine that Trump is an insurrectionist. So even if he does win in November, Donald Trump, Congress could bar him from taking office, what's going on here?HABBA: Hey, why don't we also spy on his election for 2024 and then act like it didn't happen? I mean, it's what they're always doing. They double down, they triple down, and they become desperate. I'm not sure where their PR people are, but they should take a look at the polls.What they're doing is not working and what President Trump said today was so articulate, and so on point. He was calm, he was measured, and he said it very clearly.President Biden, do your job. Stop attacking me. Fight fair and square. I don't want to win this way. I want to win fair and square.You've got to take your henchmen off of me, your witch hunts, your election interference cases and if you can walk, walk your way to the ballot in 2024 and vote.But he is not able to do so and that's the truth. So the desperation as we're seeing with what they said today going to Congress, it just, you know, they double down, they triple down. Tomorrow we'll hear more of it.But they're not realizing that the American people see straight through it, Jesse, and they're sick of it.WATTERS: All right, we just want to see a fair fight. Is that too much to ask? I don't think so, and I'd never asked for anything.Alina, you know that. Thank you.HABBA: Nothing.WATTERS: So what happened to comedy? Johnny finds out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Why is everyone so offended?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People walk around. They've got maggots in their (bleep). You know what I'm saying?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: There's an open wound in the south with mobs of mysterious military aged men pouring through daily. We see terrorists getting caught and criminals slipping through and murdering our women and the border is bleeding Biden out politically. This time, the media isn't stitching up his cuts, they are digging the knife deeper.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS: Why did it take so long for the President to address this this crisis at the border?BASH: Is it the policy of the Biden administration to allow as many migrants to come across the border in order to change the political dynamics? The electoral dynamics of America?MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: A 22-year-old nursing student, I know you've been following this, Laken Riley in the state of Georgia was murdered. Should this man have been deported?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now without the media on his side, Biden can't survive. They're covering the border instead of covering it up. The chief of Border Patrol who worked for Biden for two years says the president never even called him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAUL ORTIZ, FORMER BORDER PATROL CHIEF: I've never had one conversation with the president or the vice president for that matter.And so, I was a chief for the Border Patrol. I commanded 21,000 people, that's a problem.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Joe Biden had spoken to Dylan more than his own border chief and he still hasn't called Laken Riley's family either.Biden had George Floyd's family on speed dial. When it was Jussie Smollett faked a hate crime, Joe was there for him, but 11 days after Laken was murdered by a migrant, he let in. He still hasn't said her name, because they don't want you to know migrant crime is real. They want you to think Trump is making it up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PSAKI: Migrant crime, I mean like, he is unveiling a new product by the way. That's how he is pitching it.His so-called migrant crime wave is just not happening. It is a lie. An NBC News analysis I mean, like he's unveiling a new product. By the way, that's how he's pitching it.His so-called migrant Crime Wave is just not happening. It's a lie. And NBC news and analysis released just this week found that crime has actually dropped in the cities that received the most migrants from the southern border.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now the only place crime IS going down is Venezuela because they're sending all their criminals here. Migrant crime isn't down in sanctuary cities, it is just not being reported. That's why they are sanctuary cities.They don't report or report and any city can make crime go down if they stop prosecuting it. On local news, night after night in America's sanctuary cities, we hear about murder, rape, assault. Migrant crime is real and it's preventable.This guy, a Caribbean illegal has been arrested 65 times. He just slugged nurses at a hospital and now he's on the lam. These three illegal Portuguese arrested in Rhode Island after a baby was killed.A Brazilian illegal convicted of child rape in Brazil was just arrested in Boston. Some we assume are good people, but this was a bad hombre, and Border Patrol arrested three gangsters from Ecuador and the Dominican Republic. Their rap sheets include agg assault, trafficking, endangering a child.Now, if Biden called his Border Patrol chief, he would have told him just end catch-and-release.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ORTIZ: We need to make sure that Central America, South America, Mexico, that those regions understand that if you pay a smuggler and you cross him between the ports of entry, and you do not have a legitimate claim to some sort of asylum benefit, you're going to be sent back.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Chris Hansen is the host of "Takedown" with Chris Hanson on TruBlu. Is migrant crime a hoax?CHRIS HANSEN, HOST, TAKEDOWN WITH CHRIS HANSEN: It is not a hoax. I just spent a week, Jesse, undercover with the Polk County, Florida Sheriff's Office, Grady Judd, the sheriff there.In the course of a week, we did a predator investigation, predators looking for children online and a human trafficking investigation. The human trafficking side, 228 people arrested in a week, 10 percent illegal immigrant citizens from other countries.WATTERS: Are they being trafficked? Or are they traffickers?HANSEN: It's both. So in one case, and we have this on video, and you'll see this coming up on TruBlu, we have two women coming into a hotel, all on hidden camera being recorded. They cut a deal, sex with the undercover, two women $1,300.00, and later after the arrest, they told investigators they had to earn $3,000.00 a week to pay the people who smuggled them in to this country.WATTERS: So they're indebted to the cartels who have trafficked them and then they pay off that debt through a life of crime in the United States.HANSEN: That's the only way they can make this money and they're forced into it. So three Venezuelans arrested, one man who was pimping these women out and the two victims of human trafficking.WATTERS: They're saying crime is down where all of these migrants are heading.HANSEN: Maybe, overall crime has gone down, but you have cases of horrific crimes. The case here and in Georgia, a guy, you know a few months ago, he is taking selfies, Jose Ibarra in Times Square, and now he is accused of killing 22-year-old, Laken Riley.And you have to remember that in the last year, the stats will show 79,000 illegal immigrants came into this country with criminal histories, but each one of those on average has committed at least four crimes according to the statistics and these are all verified.So suddenly 79,000 turns into you know, 300.WATTERS: Do you even believe these statistics? I mean, you don't know who is coming across, you don't know the gotaways. Half of these things they could just be making up.HANSEN: Well, they could be, but you know, the Border Patrol, Homeland Security, INS, they want to put these stats together, they want to arrest these people. They don't want to see this happen. They don't want to see somebody on whom they have an immigration hold allowed to go free in a sanctuary city because they don't recognize the immigration hold.There, the criminal justice system has another crack at some of these bad guys, and they're not doing it. And one other thing, I talked to recently, a sheriff down at the border in Arizona who told me that he gets as many as 250 kids, children a day coming over the border and they are lost.WATTERS: Disappear.HANSEN: Disappear. What happens to those kids?WATTERS: Well, I think we know and that's tragic. "Takedown" with Chris Hansen, TruBlu TV. Check it out.HANSEN: Thank you, Jesse.WATTERS: Thank you.Why are kids sucking toes at school?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: There is something seriously sick and twisted occurring in this country now. We thought we'd seen it all. Kindergarten drag queen story hour, sex changes for kids. We don't get shocked by much.But then this happened at Deer Creek High School in Oklahoma. This video shows high schoolers sucking on each other's toes at a school fundraiser.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is devouring them.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Okay, those were high school students licking peanut butter off their classmates feet. The school made a point to say no adult's feet were licked for charity. Okay, Whose idea was this? Who okayed that? You usually need a permission slip to go to the bathroom. You can't tell me people weren't surprised.This video went crazy. Almost 50 million people saw it. And now it's led to a formal investigation by the Oklahoma State Department of Education.The school district had to come out and say this: "Through this specific game, we failed to uphold the dignity of our students and the proud image of our community, we fell short, and for that we greatly apologize."Meanwhile, liberals are defending child sex dolls. In the Kentucky State Senate last week, state lawmakers were debating a bill that would criminalize the possession and trafficking of a child sex doll.How many child sex dolls are there anyway? We don't know.One probably feels like too many, but not everybody agrees with us. A Democrat state senator from Kentucky, Karen Berg, there she is, did some Googling and thinks the child sex dolls are a good thing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAREN BERG (D), KENTUCKY STATE SENATOR: I was completely unfamiliar with child sex dolls. So I had, of course to Google it last night. Minor attracted persons, and that limited amount of research that's done on these dolls, guys, suggests that they actually for people who are attracted to minors, that these dolls actually decrease their proclivity to go out and attack children, that it actually gives them a release.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Oh, gives them a release. That settles it. Child sex dolls for everybody.It seems like Berg came to her senses and then released a statement saying as a mom and a physician, I am, of course deeply concerned with the harm of pedophilia and I regretted my question. The committee didn't convey that. I voted in favor to outlaw child sex dolls. Thank God. But why does the left keep trying to normalize pedophilia? And why do they call the minor- attracted persons?Let's bring in clinical psychologist, Dr. Chloe Carmichael.Before we get to the child sex dolls, can we talk about the sucking of the toes? What purpose would that serve?DR. CHLOE CARMICHAEL, CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST: Well, Jesse, that's a very good question and I know that the school tried to say well, no adults' toes were sucked. But nevertheless, they monetized the experience of high schoolers doing this to each other. And when we are in an environment where people are using ridiculous terms like minor-attracted persons, and we have an epidemic of child porn, both children being featured in and consuming porn, and I'm sure in their comprehensive sex education, they probably cover kink and everything else now.And so there, they then decided to have these high schoolers doing this to each other at an event that was for fundraising. On some level, this experience was monetized and that is disgusting. The school should be completely ashamed.WATTERS: A foot fetish fundraiser. You have adult, you have gym teachers and administrators sitting there in the bleachers watching kids suck each other's toes for money.CARMICHAEL: Every adult in that room should be ashamed of themselves. When that school put out a statement saying we failed to uphold the dignity, they actively degraded the dignity by encouraging or even permitting, as you said, children need a permission slip to go to the bathroom, much less to engage in this type of activity. These children who have been isolated through COVID, and again exposed to this porn epidemic and now we're going to encourage them to lie on the floor and suck each other's toes in a monetized environment? I honestly think that there should be a lot of firings that occur in Oklahoma very soon.WATTERS: Firings. There should be arrests. That's what there should be.CARMICHAEL: Definitely.WATTERS: These child sex dolls. Is there any research that shows that child sex dolls would reduce child sexual abuse?CARMICHAEL: Well, first of all, Jesse, even if there were such research, I would be extremely skeptical of it. But I did do a brief review of this supposed literature and no, there is not even you know, such a convincing "body of literature," but as a clinical psychologist, what I would say is that, that being with this child sex doll would be tantamount to what we call cognitive rehearsal, where you are actively doing just like we know a basketball player can visualize himself making the basket and then he'll do it, that's what these doll props would be.They also encourage what we call cognate You are actively doing just like we know a basketball player can visualize himself making the basket and then he'll do it. That's what these doll props would be. They also encourage what we call cognitive elaboration where maybe you have a curiosity or a fantasy and then with this prop, you go ahead and you start elaborating on it.Even worse is the insinuation that this is in some way therapeutic, because what's next? Are taxpayers going to be paying for somebody's therapy child sex doll?WATTERS: Yes, the migrants get a free sex doll and a phone when they cross Biden's border. I can see it happening right now.CARMICHAEL: And are we going to give domestic abusers a doll of their wife that they can smack that doll around and we're going to tell them that that's therapeutic?WATTERS: Yes, it is one of those boxing dummies. Just give every domestic abuser one of those, problem solved. And this is happening in Kentucky and the toe licking, Oklahoma, states I'd never thought I'd see experience that kind of depravity.Chloe, we have to go or I should say, Dr. Carmichael, excuse me.CARMICHAEL: You can call me whatever you want, Jesse. It's good to see you.WATTERS: Thanks. You, too.So Daisy, remember her? She talked to PRIMETIME. Right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Ask any husband or wife, we hate admitting when we're wrong. If you think that's difficult, take politicians. Their permissive policies triggered a crime wave and instead of owning it and fixing the problem, they're normalizing the problem. Shoplifting, "The Washington Post" says don't sweat it because, "America is a sticky fingered nation built on stolen land."Since COVID, the New York City subway racked up more subway murders than in the previous 15 years combined, even introducing a level of artistic sophistication into the subway, get you bludgeoned in the head.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: That woman had seven priors -- seven priors -- because of bail reform, and that judge let her walk again. Democrats claimed that only one percent of the people let out on bail would reoffend? Lie.According to a new study from John Jay College, 66 percent of people with rap sheets who were let go under bail reform were arrested again.And if you had felony priors and got bailed out, you likely had another felony. So people all over the country know they can get away with murder.In Georgia, a group of teens shot up a Six Flags on opening day.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: It's a symptom of a greater problem. The left has established this permissive attitude towards crime and now, people feel entitled to attack and shoot innocents.Some do drugs, some live on the streets. Look at California, the epicenter of the country soft-on-crime social experiment. Open drug uses encouraged and vagrancy rarely addressed.Liberal lawmakers and DAs have tied the cops and so when they try to do their jobs, they're treated like the criminals.On Friday, we introduced you to Daisy the Venice Healer. She's a homeless woman who has built a makeshift she-shed on the Venice Beach boardwalk where she lives and offers spiritual healings to those in need.She calls it a tiny home, but there are laws against living on the Strip. I mean, you can't just live on the sidewalk, but when the cops came to tell Daisy to move along, she flipped.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SERGEANT MCADAMS: Daisy, I need to talk to you. Stop moving.DAISY THE VENICE HEALER: You're too far. Stay out of my biofield.SERGEANT MCADAMS: Okay.DAISY THE VENICE HEALER: My biofield goes 12 feet.SERGEANT MCADAMS: One more time, 12 feet. I'm good with that.Okay, listen, Daisy. I'm Sergeant McAdams with the Los Angeles Police Department.DAISY THE VENICE HEALER: You're not, goddess. That's your fake ass name.You're a goddess. You're a superhero and I' not going to listen to your authority and your uniform.Tell me your first name, you don't want me calling you Sergeant, do you?SERGEANT MCADAMS: Yes, I do. I'm a Sergeant with the Los Angeles Police Department. Daisy, I need to talk to you.DAISY THE VENICE HEALER: All right, Sergeant, tell me everything. Just stay out of my biofield.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: After about an hour of verbal abuse, Daisy moved the she-shed down the road. But PRIMETIME tracked her down and Daisy is back on the beach.I spoke to her earlier and this is how it went.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAISY THE VENICE HEALER: It is not true, because I'm angry. I'm angry because I have unprocessed emotions that became stagnant. And it is not true that's trauma.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Okay, so I tried to reel her in, and it worked for a few seconds.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So Daisy, why were you living out on the street? What's your goal?DAISY THE VENICE HEALER: I'm not telling you or any other man I haven't met where I sleep. I don't even know if I like you that much. Next question.WATTERS: What kind of healing do you do?DAISY THE VENICE HEALER: Good question. Aren't we all on a healing journey of learning and growth working on ourselves? So I'm Daisy the Venice Healer, because I'm healing myself.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But then I made the mistake of trying to give her some advice, you know to help her get it together available for preorder right now, but she wasn't having it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Good luck. Next time maybe listen to what the police have to say and thank you for your healing properties.DAISY THE VENICE HEALER: Oh, thank you for the unsolicited advice. Here catch. It's unsolicited advice, just splattered all over you.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: All right now think about it, there are bouquets of daisies everywhere. Police do their best, but they don't have the support to deal with cases like this.Attorney and retired NYPD inspector, Paul Mauro joins me now. How does law enforcement grapple with the daisies of the world?PAUL MAURO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: With a lot of hope. Okay, that it's just not going to go bad.Look, you know, New York City has no shortage of people that are in Daisy's zone here. But ask yourself this: What is the prognosis for her long term? Do we see Daisy coming out of whatever that she is in and becoming a productive member of society? And that's the piece that's never considered because here in New York, generally, they end up going to the hospital. They give them some fluids, maybe they dose them a little bit, and they put them right back out.There really isn't, no matter what they say, there really isn't a place for the daisies in our society these days. That whole system went away years ago.What happens 20 years from now, assuming she is alive and everything is okay, right? She's living on the street. People like Daisy in cold weather zones like New York, Denver, which has a big homeless problem, you know what happens? I'm just going to be very frank, you end up working as a cop scraping them off the sidewalk in sub-zero degrees the next morning. And I hate to be graphic, but that's where it goes. But nobody wants to hear that.When you try to enforce and try to figure out a way that you can maybe force them, like, for instance, Giuliani put in something called a cold weather alert, they had to go into the shelters. The homeless lobby and industry because it's a business here, fought it like crazy, and they got rid of it.WATTERS: So Daisy is mentally ill on drugs and a little bit of a performance artist, so if she's not committing a crime besides sleeping on the sidewalk, and you try to have her move her tiny home, and she resists, you can't really put her in jail, you say, and you can't really institutionalize her because she'll just knock back a few pills, and be out the next day.MAURO: That's right.WATTERS: So you just pray and have hope for Daisy?MAURO: Kind of. I mean, realistically, what are you going to do? You know, if she fights with you, then she goes to jail, but it won't be anything serious, you know, hopefully that she does and so she's going to get right back out and really jailed for something like that isn't really the answer.So, she is blocking the sidewalk in New York, it would be blocking pedestrian traffic. You can take her. New York doesn't allow for homeless encampments. That's something that's relatively recent. We were putting up with that for a while, but there was too much pushback.But as I said, there really isn't a great mechanism and it's something that we just really don't want to confront.WATTERS: All right, so from Daisy to some more flower power, we have one of these fossil fuel protesters got in Manchin's face at an event the other day and got toppled like a statue. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PROTESTER: Joe Manchin, you sold our country and you got rich doing it. You sick (bleep). How dare you?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: I shouldn't laugh. But how was that security handled, Paul?MAURO: Looks fairly appropriate to me. I'm not sure Manchin would have been quite as delicate. He looked pretty angry. Manchin is a big guy.WATTERS: He is.MAURO: So anyway, look, you know, obviously he's getting in his space, he's being threatening, et cetera. You can articulate the fact that you had to take action because you didn't know what he was going to do. He moved in to -- he was moving forward, et cetera. It looks fairly appropriate to me.WATTERS: And you have to expect this reaction if you're going to curse the guy out like that and come after his family.MAURO: Of course.WATTERS: Do you think if Manchin had taken a swing he would have connected?MAURO: He might have but then you know, they'd already be in court. And I'm sure this guy's a hero to all of his buddies. And, you know, nonetheless, I think that this was the appropriate response.WATTERS: That's what Geraldo told me when I was first going out on the street. He said, Jesse, if anybody takes a swing at you, lean into it.MAURO: Yes.WATTERS: And then sue him.MAURO: I'm sure. I bet you this guy is already talking to lawyers.WATTERS: I'm sure, he is.All right, Paul, thank you so much.MAURO: Thank you.WATTERS: And thank you Daisy. We love you.Johnny hit the streets.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: I'm sure a lot of funny things happened to you, but what's the funniest thing to have ever happened to you?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Almost pooped to myself when I got drunk one time.
