LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: We have more photos and video going up by the moment.Thank you again for watching. Remember it's America now and forever, and Jesse Watters takes it all from here.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): It is a conspiracy theory made up by Russian intelligence pumped through Smirnov into America.WATTERS: A new hoax. The Russians are behind Biden's impeachment.("CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: Biden's dog has now bitten everyone at the White House.Google's artificial intelligence turns everyone Black.Plus --JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Viva --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Viva Las Vegas.WATTERS: There is another missing Biden diamond and no one knows where it is. The president's brother, Jim Biden, better known as Jimmy the Chin told congressional investigators that he threw out a diamond that the Chinese bribed Hunter with.Here's their story: The Chinese slipped Hunter Biden a diamond while his dad was vice president. Biden's brother, Jimmy says Hunter gave him the Chinese diamond to have it appraised, but Jimmy says he threw it in the garbage and this is the second Chinese diamond the Biden's claimed they lost.The Chinese also bribed hunter with a three-carat $80,000.00 diamond in 2017 that Hunter claimed disappeared. The Biden's keep diamonds around like Blacks keep cash around. Right, Fani?The Biden family was in business with part-time Chinese diamond dealers who bought $23 million worth of diamonds in a single year. I have a feeling the Biden's lost more than two diamonds. The Bidens are probably keeping it safe next to Joe's Corvette.And remember, the $1.7 million in Chinese cash that Hunter withdrew from ATMs? Also missing. Isn't it strange how all the hard evidence of bribery keeps getting lost? Even the Chinese chairman who made the bribes has disappeared.They've had so much success disappearing evidence, the magicians in the Democratic Party have another trick: They're trying to make the impeachment inquiry go poof. Here's how the magic trick works.Biden's Justice Department arrested the FBI informant who reported that both Bidens, Joe and Hunter, took bribes from Ukraine. The informant, Alexander Smirnov reported the bribe allegations to his FBI handler who wrote it up in a report, they call it a 1023, the FBI deep sixed it, but once Republicans got their hands on the report, the same prosecutor who got busted for cooking up Hunter's sweetheart plea deal, arrested the informant, and accused him of talking to people close to Russian intelligence.Isn't that why the FBI pays him? Because he talks to people.Former FBI agent, Stuart Kaplan told us that it was only a matter of time before the informant got popped.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STUART KAPLAN, FORMER FBI AGENT: When that 1023 form was released last year, my colleagues and I knew at that point, that informant was going to be sacrificed. It was just a matter of time.That informant has been on the books since 2010, 2011, 2012, up until more recently. You do not stay on the books with the FBI, unless you have been vetted and you are credible.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Even Democrats agree the informant was credible.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RASKIN: There's a confidential human source that the FBI works with who is proven to be very credible, who reported a conversation with someone else.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But the informant may have been too credible, and now, it looks like he is a straw man to discredit Biden's impeachment.MSNBC booked old spooks all day to call the Biden bribe scandal informant Russian election interference.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NAVEED JAMALI, FORMER US INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: This like we've been here before.JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: Yes.JAMALI: It's WikiLeaks, Carter Page and all of that rolled into one.You know, for people who maybe just have lived under a rock for the last eight years. I'll say this, as I've said it before, from Russia, the Cold War never ended. United States is Vladimir Putin's main enemy. He is desperate, and this makes him incredibly dangerous.So why wouldn't he try to interfere with the election? Why wouldn't he try to undermine Joe Biden? It is just -- well, you know, it just makes total sense with everything we've seen in the last eight years.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now this time, instead of making up hoaxes to get Trump impeached, they're making them up to stop Biden from getting impeached and are now claiming that this single FBI informant was the entire foundation of the Biden family corruption scandal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HARRY LITMAN, FORMER US ATTORNEY: It is just one more aspect of the whole Russian misinformation campaign that so distorted our electoral processes from 2016 and going forward.The allegations seem to be the only evidence we have what they're calling a prong of the investigation looks to be the entire foundation and that entire foundation now may have been chopped away.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Entire foundation? Only evidence we have? The Biden bribery scandal is four-and-a-half years old and its foundation was based upon eyewitness testimony like Tony Bobulinski, hard evidence like bank records, laptops, photos of meetings, voicemails, visitor logs from the White House; e-mails texts, cheques, hours of depositions and at least two missing diamonds.We didn't find out about this FBI informant until just last summer, when Comer's investigation was well underway. The informants allegations were very similar to allegations made by Tony Bobulinski, a decorated naval officer, who the FBI coincidentally has never followed up with.The informant even used the phrase "The Big Guy" before the laptop even went public. I guess his sources were pretty good.Senator Chuck Grassley announced that two separate Justice Department field offices, New York and Pittsburgh found no hits to known sources of Russian disinformation.And right before Hunter's deposition with House investigators, this arrest is made giving Democrats their fall guy and an excuse to call the entire impeachment Russia disinformation.CIA mouthpieces are all over MSNBC today claiming the 51 letter signing Intel guys were right. Hunter's laptop was Russian disinformation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEN DILANIAN, MSNBC NEWS JUSTICE AND INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Those 51 former intelligence officials they paid a steep price for signing that letter. The Republicans said this was election interference. This was a bogus attempt to suppress a legitimate story.And as it turns out, they were right. They've been proven correct in the sense that we now know that Russian intelligence at least according to the statements of this informant, bolstered somewhat by this indictment, we're feeding him information -- false information.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Tomorrow on MSNBC, Jussie Smollett, he was right all along.Robert Mueller cleared Republicans of Russia collusion, but somehow we're back to Republicans colluding with Russia? Just before the election?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. DANIEL GOLDMAN (D-NY): Every election, it seems the Republicans fall in favor with the Russians.SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): They're willing to carry any water for Trump and I'm not sure where this kinds of now, fetish for Russia ever became as well.REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): It seems like a lot of the domestic enemies are right here serving in the House with us.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The Democrats are taking the hoaxes from 2016, the hoaxes from 2020, combining them to use in 2024. So do you see now any Republican who supports impeachment is guilty of Russia collusion.Well, let's ask an actual Russian who he prefers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): You ask who would be preferred as future president of the United States? I said that we would work with any president. But I suppose that for us, for Russia, Biden is more preferable.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now take what Putin says with a grain of salt because he's got an agenda, but if this FBI informant is feeding the FBI Russia disinformation, and that could be the case even though two DOJ field offices said it wasn't before they flip flopped, why they bury it in 2020 to help Democrats and then exploit it in 2024 to hurt Republicans?Well, according to Claire McCaskill on MSNBC, we're not even allowed to ask that question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLAIRE MCCASKILL, MSNBC POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I move that every newspaper in America quits doing any factchecks on Joe Biden until they factcheck Donald Trump every morning on the front page. It is ridiculous that "The New York Times" factcheck Joe Biden on something. I mean, he vomits lies, Trump vomits lies.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The media moves to ban factchecking of the president. That almost sounds Russian, doesn't it, red Claire?Here now, former FBI agent, Jonathan Gilliam and former CIA officer, Bryan Dean Wright.Jonathan, I mean, this started off as an operation to suppress the laptop. It has now come full circle, again to the 51 letter-writing agents were right all along. It was Russian disinformation. This is kind of sloppy, do you think they'll be able to pull this off?JONATHAN GILLIAM, RETIRED NAVY SEAL AND FORMER FBI AGENT: Well, I'm not sure. You know, they will -- the way they portray these things and the way they build it up in mainstream media, they have been able to pull this off before in convincing some voters, in convincing the DOJ and I use that word convincing lightly because they just basically set up their own evidence that the DOJ then uses to drop a case or go forward on a case in the case of Trump.But I think what you just said in your opening, and all the things that you showed, what we're looking at, whether it's the FBI, the DOJ, or all of these Democrat politicians and the Republican politicians that are nowhere to be found, it's the same players in every camp that are always involved with either taking Trump -- trying to take Trump down or to build the Bidens into something that they're not, which is not guilty or guilty, excuse me.WATTERS: Bryan, now these diamonds are missing. This is the second diamond. One was given to the Biden family while Joe was vice president from the Chinese. How many diamonds do you think you'd be able to just throw away in the garbage?BRYAN DEAN WRIGHT, FORMER CIA AGENT: Well, I dip mine in some Crisco, so they are -- they can be very slicker. You've got to be real careful. I think that's what the Bidens are doing here.Look, Smirnov did not charged for lying, okay? Isn't it interesting that to this day, Mr. Biden continues to lie, the degree to which he has met all of Hunter's business partners, that's well established that he's lying.So if we want to talk about people who are lying, let's start with Mr. Biden first, that is demonstrated again and again. This entire thing sounds and smells very, very fishy to me. You brought up all of the key pieces of information that people need to know from 2010 to 2020 he has sowed, and then suddenly he talks about Biden, and now we've got problems with him. That's odd.That deserves a thoughtful investigation, but I don't think that happened here. I think that's pretty clear that we have a very sneaky family who is working with a Department of Justice and an FBI that they can control and that to me is the bottom line.Do the American people believe that the Biden Department of Justice and the Biden FBI will investigate Joe Biden? That seems a little bit impossible to me?WATTERS: No, they're never going to do it. They've been covering up for years. I would imagine you don't want to ever be an FBI informant, Bryan -- I mean, Jonathan, because I mean, if they're just going to turn on you after 10 years, they've paid you, you've given them highly credible information that's been used in prosecutions, used in indictments, and then on a dime, if something gets too politically hot, you're cooked. That's going to hurt us.GILLIAM: Yes. We used to have a saying when I was in the bureau, I'm sure a lot of people still do, you may love the bureau, but the bureau doesn't love you. And that's something that all sources need to remember.But you know, what's interesting about a source is you never build a case solely upon a source of information. The source will provide information that you can then go and clear and investigate. And in this case, with this whole case of the Bidens, we have to look at the totality of the circumstances and I bring that up all the time because when you look at the totality of what's being brought against Biden, it's way more than just one source.But also when you look at the totality of the circumstances of what we're all talking about right here, what the left does is always accuse others of doing what they are exactly doing and anytime they can destroy somebody in the court of public opinion, they will then use that to bring prosecutions or drop cases.WATTERS: All right, Bryan, we've got to run because we've got to pay some bills. But thank you guys, both Jonathan and Bryan Dean Wright, we really appreciate it.Remember, hold on to those diamonds.Johnny goes to Vegas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. What are you leaving in here?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't tell that. I can't tell that. How dare you ask me that.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: New details on Joe Biden's daily routine confirm our fears. Our president has the tenacity of a houseplant, and he can barely make it through a full workday. A leak to "The Daily Mail" reveals Biden starts most days around 7:00 AM when he gets woken up by his cat, Willow, crawling over him in bed. I didn't even know he had a cat. The Bidens are a cat family. You know what that means?At this point, Joe turns off his CPAP machine and for those of you who don't know what a CPAP machine is, this device keeps your airways open so you don't die in your sleep. This leak checks out too because we suspect Biden appeared in public once and what looked like CPAP creases still on his face.Now, after detaching from his breathing machine, the president does about an hour of physical therapy, working on things like walking, and once he laces up his special sneakers, Joe makes his way to the Oval Office to start executing his official duties around 10:00 AM.And from there, Joe's day is filled with aides and advisers popping in, debrief him on how his policies are working out, can't imagine those are fun briefings.Every day he blocks out time to make a phone call to Hunter, and then usually calls a lid around four. So 10 to four is the new nine to five, and that's not including lunch with Kamala.The president is always late to meetings, too, and never in a rush to go anywhere so frustrated aides are forced to schedule events in Biden time. Meaning two o'clock really means three.And when Joe does manage to leave the White House, he makes sure to keep his friends extra close. Like yesterday when he was in San Francisco with Nancy Pelosi. Look at those two beauties, hand in hand, holding on either for love or dear life.Gingerly walking the tarmac, life alerts at the ready. There we are, ladies and gentlemen, the two most powerful leaders this country has to offer. I can only imagine the conversation.Mr. President, Paul and I are already up $10 million with NVIDIA. Thanks again for the CHIPS Act. Joe Biden responding, who's Paul?Commander has been a very, very bad boy. PRIMETIME has learned that Joe Biden's dog, Commander has attacked Secret Service agents at least 24 times and we knew Commander had a mean streak with Secret Service agents, but never knew the extent of the carnage.At one point, Commander bit someone so ferociously that a White House tour was canceled so staff could mop up blood from the floors of the East Wing.Now as a dog bite survivor myself, I sympathize with the agents, but I suffered merely puncture wounds. At no point was my hand and upper thigh area spewing with blood. Although still to this day, you can see the scar on my upper thigh area. It's quite noticeable.The Biden's must have realized these weren't playful accidents. Commander has been deported, a first for the president. The First Lady claims the German Shepherd has been given to another family member. The Bidens really must hate that family member. They probably gave it to Hunter's baby mama.Hunter didn't paint anything this month, babe. There's a vicious dog instead.This biting machine is more evidence that proves the Biden family has no class. Both dogs, Major and Commander bit everyone in sight. Zero apologies.Crack left in the White House, they blame the construction worker; Trans flashing, paternity test denying, falling asleep at funerals, First Family, not our best look.Every time you peel back the curtain, you see the disgusting garage, the hair sniffing, the showering with kids, the widow shagging, the dogs, the drugs, the diamond bribes, it is no wonder this filthy White House can't keep the country in order, it can't keep its own house in order. Or am I being too mean? To the dog?Tim Miller is a former secret service agent.Tim, how serious is this?TIM MILLER, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT: Jesse, I never thought I'd see the day where the Secret Service needed protection in the White House grounds. And, you know, as a German Shepherd owner, pretty much my whole life, you recognize these dogs are powerful and that's why we use them in law enforcement and in the military.And when they're trained, they're awesome. When they're not trained, they are a deadly weapon. They run 30 miles an hour. They have bite pressure. I've seen these dogs in action and it is shocking to me that more than 20 Secret Service agents have been attacked or bitten, one knocked down, and you've just got to ask yourself the question, who is more important here? The dog or the Secret Service agents willing to lay down their life to protect you?WATTERS: What would it be like working the White House detail with this thing on the loose?MILLER: Well, you know, anybody that's been around a German Shepherd that's angry recognizes immediately. I don't care, you're going to be afraid. You know, you're going to have a cautious approach.But here's the real issue, Jesse, that dog became a security threat, not just to the agents, but to others. Because we know when a dog bites and draws blood, it's likely to do it again and again and again and we saw it in this case.You know, quite frankly, my question was, you know, if there was a real security incident, which I've been a part of, are the agents going to be more concerned with being attacked by the dog or someone coming over the fence? It's crazy.WATTERS: What would be a worse scenario as a Secret Service agent on the Biden detail? Getting bit by his dog or witnessing him skinny dipping?MILLER: Well, I think they're co-equal and I do think, Jesse, you know, the fact that this dog was in the area and able again to pounce, you know, it's scary, so I'm glad it's over. Maybe they'll issue a pardon to it, man.WATTERS: That's right and now, they are a cat family. Unbelievable. Thank you so much. Thanks for your service.MILLER: Thanks for having me, Jesse.WATTERS: Well Happy DEI Thursday.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: America has been giving other countries money for over 200 years. In 1812, we sent a ship with 50,000 worth of food to Venezuela after an earthquake, but it really kicked into high gear after World War Two and we were playing tug of war with the Soviets for influence and Washington hasn't turned off the money faucet since.If anything happens in a foreign country, we cut a check. One of those countries is Honduras.Over the last 10 years, we paid them over a billion dollars, and they send us a million migrants in exchange. But every president and politician for the last decade said the Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez is the secret ingredient to ending illegal migration and the drug cartels.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want to thank all of them publicly, I already did so privately for going after and arresting smugglers in a more aggressive fashion.DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: President Hernandez is working with the United States very closely. We're winning after years and years of losing. We are stopping drugs at a level that has never happened.MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are grateful for these actions and grateful for your leadership.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We are neighbors. We are friends. We have issues to address.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Well, it turns out our friend in Honduras was to timing us with El Chapo.El Chapo pay them millions in bribes for protection. He gave cartel members police escorts and let them fly across the continent with cocaine under the radar.President Juan used the bribe money to rig his elections. The former Honduran president is now on trial here in New York. The Fed say President Juan helped the cartel smuggle 500 tons of cocaine into the country.He bragged to other drug traffickers that he's going to "stuff the drugs right up the noses of the gringos," and Juan kept that promise.This guy was going to DC and calling the shots and we listened to him for a decade and Juan he was getting paid by us, and El Chapo. It's time we stopped funding crooked Latin American leaders, they can't be trusted. They pocket our cash and then send more migrants and drugs.We just put our finger on the root causes -- our politicians and theirs.Hector Berrellez is a former DEA agent and recipient of the Attorney General's Award for heroism.Was this a surprise to you that the Honduran president for a decade was on the take from El Chapo?HECTOR BERRELLEZ, FORMER DEA AGENT AND RECIPIENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AWARD FOR HEROISM: Not at all, Jesse.The Honduran government for decades has been corrupt, to my knowledge, going back to the 1980s. While I was assigned to supervise the investigation of the kidnapping, torture, and murder of DEA Special Agent, Kiki Camarena, we indicted a Honduran drug lord Juan Ramon Matta- Ballesteros on CCE -- continuing criminal enterprise, RICO charges and also murder charges.We asked for his extradition to this country to face those charges and the Honduran government declined to send him over. We then asked the Honduran government to charge him with those crimes in Honduras, and they also declined.So as I say, that just means, you know, we result in desperate actions. The Department of Justice ordered the ordinary, extraordinary rendition of Juan Ramon Mata-Ballesteros to this country, meaning that without their knowledge nor their cooperation, we went into Honduras and brought him out.He was convicted of all those charges, and right now he is serving a life prison term for like I stated before, CCE, RICO charges and the murder of our -- and being suspected of murder of Kiki.WATTERS: I mean, Hector, does this prove, are our politicians corrupt or are they stupid?BERRELLEZ: Well, a little bit of both, actually, or a lot of both. They can't be that stupid. I mean, these guys are totally corrupt. They work with -- they aid and abet the drug traffickers for millions of dollars. And not only in Honduras, that's prevalent throughout South America, Mexico, and Latin America.So you know, that's the way they do business.WATTERS: Right. I mean, I think we should assume every Latin American leader is in bed with the cartels, and then we'll just work back from there. I think that's a smart way to do business down there, because the whole continent seems crooked.Hector, thank you so much, and thanks for all of your sacrifice and service.BERRELLEZ: Thank you for having me, Jesse.WATTERS: Well, Google thinks the Vikings were Black.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: We will be doing this on a weekly basis, DEI is something we must have.WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday. PRIMETIME's favorite day of the week in honor of Al Sharpton. We're bringing you the best stories about diversity, equity and inclusion, starting with this: Forget about China, Iran, and Russia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken is going after people who use the wrong pronouns.In a memo to staff, he cautioned against using gendered language. The list of do not use phrases include manpower, you guys, ladies and gentlemen, mother, father, son, stepdaughter and husband, wife.He also warned staff against pressuring co-workers to share their pronouns, which can include Z and Zer. So let me get this straight. Blinken says you can't misgender your co-worker, and you can't ask your co-worker what gender they are. Sounds like a trap.But it's not just in Washington, the Multiple Sclerosis Society allegedly fired a 90-year-old volunteer for not putting her pronouns in her bio. A few days after bringing it up to her boss, she got this e-mail: "It has come to our attention that there has been a failure to abide by our diversity, equity, inclusion guidelines during your time as a volunteer, we have made the difficult decision to have you step down from your volunteer position immediately."Fran was devastated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRAN ITKOFF, VOLUNTEER: I was completely shocked as I read that. I couldn't believe that. I had to read it a couple of times to see if I'm getting this -- getting what she said.I'm just upset and disappointed in them.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Yesterday, the MS Society gave Fran a half-baked apology, writing, "We realized now that we made a mistake, and we should have had more conversation with Fran before making this decision."A Maxim wacko activist is urging Christians to support trans rights because get this, God is transgender and nonbinary.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRANS PERSON: God is trans. In Genesis 1, it talks about let's make humanity in our image, the I form of they, the term spirit is a feminine word important for the Holy no, Holy Spirit.God's pronouns are literally they, their, them.How else are we going to talk about the Trinity?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So the Catholics on PRIMETIME poking some holes in the logic. The Trinity is made up of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, all the same guy. And the Bible refers to God with a capital H when using the pronoun Him.Wait until he hears about Adam and Eve.And finally, a PRIMETIME victory. Nassau County on Long Island just became a sanctuary for female sports. Today, the county executive announced a ban on biological males competing against girls.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRUCE BLAKEMAN, COUNTY EXECUTIVE OF NASSAU COUNTY: It is an unfair advantage for someone who is a biological male, to compete against a biological female. And again, I view this as a form of bullying and it will not be tolerated.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Congratulations to the girls of Nassau County, your games just got a little more fair.Google's AI program, Gemini just dropped and it is not ready for primetime. You can ask it questions or you can have it generate an image, but there's a bit of a problem. There's no room for Whites in the code.When you ask Gemini to create an image of a historical event, you get something like this. Gemini says, this is one of America's Founding Fathers. Which Founding Father? Not sure. Maybe AI learns everything they know about America by watching "Hamilton."Here's what you get when you ask Google to give you a picture of German soldiers during World War Two. I didn't realize the Nazis celebrated DEI Thursday.Google apparently doesn't think Whites exist. If you ask Gemini to generate an image of a White person, it can't compute. It gives you this message: "While I understand your request, I'm unable to generate images that specify ethnicity or race. Instead, I can offer you images of families that celebrate diversity and inclusion featuring people of various ethnicities and backgrounds."I asked Gemini to generate a picture of the Pope, and you get an Indian woman and an African or what if you'd like an image of Russia, one of the whitest countries on Earth, you have a Latina, East Asian woman and maybe a Pakistani and another African. But it doesn't stop there, Google thinks Vikings were Black. How intelligent is artificial intelligence?The only way you get AI to show you a picture of whites is to prompt it with racist Black stereotypes like eating fried chicken. Now if you want to know why Google's Gemini hates Whites, just look at the guy who oversees the development. Senior Director Jack Krawczyk made his politics very well known, writing: "White privilege is effing real. Don't be in a-hole and act guilty about it. I don't mind paying more taxes and investing in overcoming systemic racism" and my favorite, "Jesus only cares about White people."Now, Krawczyk issued a quasi-apology to Fox saying, "We think Gemini missed the mark." You didn't miss the mark, Jack. I think you nailed it. This is CRT history. You're rigging AI. We caught you and it doesn't have a mind of its own. It has your mind and your mind is riddled with White guilt. And sadly, the next generation of kids are going to suffer because of your insecurities.Radio host, Tommy Sotomayor joins us now. I didn't know there was a Black Founding Father, did you?TOMMY SOTOMAYOR, DIRECTOR, A FATHERLESS AMERICA: I did not, although, if you listen to a lot of the pro-Blacks, they will tell you that the first six I think or seven presidents of the United States before George Washington were all Black, that it took a Black man in order to set up the United States. And then once we got it working, we let George Washington take over the reins.WATTERS: Whoa. I mean that --SOTOMAYOR: You didn't know this?WATTERS: I didn't know that. That what else --SOTOMAYOR: His name is Hanson, look it up.WATTERS: All right, I have to look that up.What about the Vikings? Because when I first saw that, I thought that was a Scandinavian guy wearing blackface.SOTOMAYOR: Now, hold on a minute. Now, I can understand how I got the Vikings wrong. I mean, think about it. Look, you've had Randall Cunningham playing there, you've had Nwangwu. Oh, I'm sorry, you're not talking about the NFL Vikings? Then, no, I have no idea why now, all of a sudden, Thor is going to be Black.WATTERS: What about a female Pope? Not that there couldn't be a female Pope, but I didn't know there already was one.SOTOMAYOR: Right, and maybe they are future proofing it, making sure that everybody can feel great about it. Saw your segment about the basketball players. Finally, they're just letting the women play the women. Not sure if you saw that big guy throw down that girl, but that's what they wanted.So when you said is this something that isn't a hiccup? Or is it what they wanted? This is working precisely the way that they wanted. I'm so glad that you said that. That this is their mind. So of course they want to see a female Pope, anything that they can turn on top of its head, they will.WATTERS: When you Google AI family enjoying a fried chicken dinner. It's all Whites around the table.SOTOMAYOR: It's this thing. I am telling you they're trying to make it be this world on top of -- the world flipped up, the pyramid on top of its head. The fact that you can have the most right -- I mean, watermelon, there'll be White guys doing it. And so the racist -- the stereotypes work as long as we can stereotype Whites and I've learned that the hard way. If you want to stereotype some people, stereotype White, males, Christians.WATTERS: Okay, so if I google AI Wayne Gretzky, it's going to show me a Black dude in ice skates.SOTOMAYOR: Yes, it's going to be a brother from Compton. He's going to have on a red bandana, and he's going to have on Red Wings outfit, that's going to be it.WATTERS: Okay, are they trying to erase Whites? Or are they trying to elevate Blacks? Or are they just trying to screw up history for the fun of it?SOTOMAYOR: Let's just be real here. I think what they're really trying to do is start like this race war because you're constantly trying to erase one group.Now remember, Blacks have felt like they've been erased. They felt like they have not been acknowledged in history. So then turning around and changing history and removing the Whites and putting the Blacks as you said, with "Hamilton," putting the Blacks in those position --WATTERS: But, Tommy, I'm not sure the Blacks want to be honored as Nazis. I don't think.SOTOMAYOR: Look, we don't even want Black History Month. What has happened in Black History Month? We don't have -- look, I'm Black as they come. And the one thing I don't have is anywhere to go for this whole 28/29 days. We don't do anything. We just complain and tell you what you should be doing.WATTERS: All right. Happy Black History Month. I feel like I've celebrated more than you have, Tommy.SOTOMAYOR: Thank you.

It's called "Get It Together" and she explained to me how her family dysfunction propelled her into prostitution. She says she wants to legalize all prostitution and wants to have government cameras in every bedroom in order to keep the prostitutes safe when she extracts all the money from all men in the world because she hates men.I basically came across this a lot during this book process. A lot of these liberals are traumatized and are just spewing all of their emotional baggage on the rest of us. None of this stuff is well thought out. It's not logical, but it explains everything.Go order the book.Let's do some texts.Doug from Jacksonville, Florida: Are the Russians greasing the stairs to Air Force One?German Shepherd also a Russian spy.Bill from Connecticut: Jesse, how naive are you? Diamonds are a girl's best friend. Dr. Jill has them.Greg from Granville, Massachusetts: If I lose two diamonds, will the Bidens explain that to my wife?Listen, maybe the Chinese were just proposing -- twice.Matt from Bakersfield, California: Those missing diamonds might be sewn into Commander's dog collar. No one's checking there.Rick from North Carolina: Do you think Joe's cat bites?No but the cat is an alarm clock. Every time he walks over Joe's face in the morning, he wakes up, takes the CPAP thing off his face and continues to breathe.Jim from Denver, North Carolina: We're a cat family. What is that supposed to mean?I think everybody knows what that means.Alice from Maine: Show us the scar.We'd have to pixelate it. Maybe we will pre-tape it.That's all for tonight. DVR the show. Hannity is up next.I'm Watters and this is my world.
