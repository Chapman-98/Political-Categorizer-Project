VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: I think it's coinciding with the availability of mail-in ballots.LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Well, they knew that this was coming, so if they don't have the lawyers in place, if they don't have the strategy in place, Republicans have no one to blame, but themselves.Chris and Victor, thank you.That's it for us tonight.

He swore.(LAUGHTER)WATTERS: It's 8:00 PM in most of Michigan where the first polls close in the state's primary. For Republicans, 16 delegates are up for grabs tonight with Trump being the massive favorite in the contest. He already holds nearly a hundred-delegate lead over Nikki Haley. And for Democrats, Biden faces a challenge from progressives in the state over his stance on the war on Gaza.Now, a lot of those voters, Arab-Americans, hope to send a message to the president by voting uncommitted. Now, stick with us for the results as they stream in.Now, John F. Kennedy rightfully earned himself the title the first TV president. He knew how to work a camera. Richard Nixon used television to loosen up. Here he is on late night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICHARD NIXON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Republicans don't want another piano player in the White House.(LAUGHTER)(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)(RICHARD NIXON PLAYS THE PIANO.)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And since Nixon, every major politician has used late night to showcase their swagger. Bill Clinton brought the sax.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)(BILL CLINTON PLAYING THE SAXOPHONE.)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: George W. brought the jokes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE W.

With my hair spray.FALLON: Yes. Donald Trump everybody.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Joe Biden went on late night and brought nothing except traffic to a halt. Midtown almost missed "The Five." Greg can't carry that show without me.Now, President Biden skipped the Super Bowl interview to sit down with Seth Meyers. For those of you who don't know who he is, he comes on after Jimmy Fallon, and for those of you who don't know Jimmy Fallon is, ask Jay Leno.These shows are all pre-taped so Biden could be edited and get to bed. Biden didn't bring a sax, a joke, or charisma. All the president had were sunglasses.("LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)MEYERS: There's a Dark Brandon conspiracy meme, and this is something that you seem to have a lot of fun with. You've co-opted.(LAUGHTER)MEYERS: You've co-opted Dark Brandon and this is a yard sign and do you enjoy playing around with the Dark Brandon meme?BIDEN: No, I resent the hell out of it.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Is the stage manager holding up an "applause" sign? Because why are people clapping for sunglasses? What's so funny about a grown man putting on sunglasses?It's funny when you put sunglasses on a dog. That's funny. Putting sunglasses on babies is funny and cute. But is this all Biden has? Yes. And he forgot to take them off?("LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)MEYERS: Can you confirm or deny that there is an active conspiracy between you and Miss Swift?BIDEN: Where you getting this information? It is classified.(LAUGHTER)MEYERS: They're classified, even for me?BIDEN: That's classified information.MEYERS: You won't share with us?BIDEN: I am not getting -- but I will tell you, she did endorse me in 2020.MEYERS: She did.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)MEYERS: You might be wondering -- you might be wondering, you think, it might come around again?BIDEN: I told you, it's classified.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That entire exchange was scripted. The producers and the White House aides prepared that for days.Is there a conspiracy? It's classified. That was their big bit. The White House and NBC wrote a hoax into the show, too.In Meyers' monologue, he said that Trump is so old, he forgot Melania's name.("LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)MEYERS: Former President Trump told supporters last week that former First Lady Melania Trump will soon be making more regular appearances on the campaign trail.Not if she heard what you called there last week.TRUMP: They call up my wife, our great First Lady. She was a great First -- people love her.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: People love her. Oh, look at that. Wow, Mercedes. That's pretty good.(END VIDEO CLIP)MEYERS: I'm sorry? Mercedes? You had a nuclear meltdown when Biden messed up the president of Egypt and you can't remember your wife's name.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now, the media went from I can barely keep up with Biden to well, Trump is slow too. Except it's not true.Trump never forgot Melania's name. It's a hoax.He was referencing Mercedes Schlapp, the host of CPAC. His audience was showing love to Melania. Everybody at CPAC knows who Mercedes Schlapp is. Even "The Times" Debunked it. We called NBC, asked them why they peddled misinformation. They're ignoring us. So I'm sending Johnny across the street to break into 30 Rock.Best part, Biden plagiarized the hoax. Watch.("LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)MEYERS: You mentioned some classified materials, some documents recently leaked, some classified documents. And this isn't a gotcha show. But I do want to ask about it that says you are currently 81 years old.BIDEN: Who the hell told you that?MEYERS: Yes.(LAUGHTER)BIDEN: That's classified.MEYERS: That's classified. All jokes aside, according to recent polling, this is a real concern for American voters. How do you address that concern going forward as you come up to the 2024 election?BIDEN: Well, a couple of things. Number one, you've got to take a look at the other guy. He's about as old as I am. But he can't remember his wife's name.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden's only punch line was a stolen hoax from Meyers' monologue. And then Biden forgot what year it was.("LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)MEYERS: What's your 2024 agenda? Because I feel like we live in such crazy times that that is one of the things I feel we hear less about.BIDEN: Look, the 2020 agenda is to finish the job.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Seth Meyers again, tried to ask him, why are you running?("LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)BIDEN: I think it's about the future. And everything -- every single thing we've done, I think we've got some good things done -- everything a-- and they told us we couldn't get them done, because things were so divided.And -- but, I think everything's -- everything we'd gotten done.He's just friendly state -- he wants to do away with if he gets elected. And I really think his views on where to take America are older than -- anyway. I don't want to get --(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The president of the United States couldn't name anything he's gotten done, or anything that he's going to do.Robert Hur witnessed this during his five-hour interview with President Biden calling him a painfully slow elderly man with a poor memory who struggles to remember things. Biden couldn't even answer what he's done and what he's going to do on a late night show.You see what happens without notecards.The president is being lampooned internationally now. Italian TV has turned Biden into a nightly segment.("FRATELLI DI CROZA/NOVE VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President? Well, the President. Mr. President. Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you okay?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is okay.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, very good.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's your name? Mr. President --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My name is Joe Kennedy.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, Biden.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now, if I were Biden, and I was losing to Trump and my party wanted to put me out to pasture and swap me out for a younger, better looking liberal, the Mideast and Europe were at war and migrants are murdering our women, the last thing I would do go out for ice cream with a comedian and then lick it when they ask about the border.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Why go to the border now, Mr. President? You're going on Thursday. Why go now?BIDEN: I've been planning to go Thursday. What I didn't know is good friend apparently is going.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Seth Meyers took his Grandpop out for ice cream to make him feel better for forgetting his lines. Here you go. Good job, Joe. You want a sugar cone?You know who lights up for ice cream? Children and the elderly. There's a reason caregivers deliver ice cream to their patients in nursing homes.According to the Alzheimer's Association, ice cream is a favorite for people with diminished faculties: "Ice cream has the power to immediately elicit soothing feelings at the very first taste of a single spoonful. It erases all the negative feelings related to the frustration and continues to stimulate pleasure receptors in the brain with every new scoop."Now, obviously, I'm not diagnosing Biden with Alzheimer's, but you see what's going on here? They clap when he puts his sunglasses on. They treat him for ice cream to make him happy. He's got his little Corvette, his toy car that he's so proud of, that he keeps his special folders next to, and no one can take those folders, those are my folders.He's a child. He copies homework. He lies, falls asleep, doesn't listen.Joey has his aviators, mint chip and his hot wheels, and he's happy. Are we really going to reelect this guy, America? Even Obama world sees it.("POD SAVE AMERICA" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you watch Joe Biden speak, oftentimes, he sounds frail and he sounds more frail than he used to.He shuffles more because of the arthritis in his back. So for most people in the country who are just watching him be president, what do they see when they turn on the television? They see him shuffle, and they hear him and he is swallowing a lot more of his words now.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Even Biden's best friend Obama knows it's over. Remember the whole best friend thing? It's weird, right?He swims naked. He crashes his bike. Jill is trying to make him eat his veggies. He goes home every weekend.He is losing to Trump and every battleground and he is so stubborn. He hasn't changed anything.New Emerson poll shows the president getting smoked down three to 10 points in each swing state. Trump's up nine in Georgia, and that was before Biden's migrant murdered Laken Riley.Every time the White House lets him out for recess, his numbers drop. You have to put this guy back in timeout.Valuetainment founder, Patrick Bet-David is the host of the PBD podcast, and he joins me now.Do you really think this guy has a shot at re-election after this kind of behavior?PATRICK BET-DAVID, FOUNDER, VALUETAINMENT: First of all, Jesse, thanks for having me on.Here is the one thing we have to ask ourselves: Do we want him to run or do we trust Las Vegas odds where Las Vegas is not in the business of losing money.Right now, the highest odds of becoming a president according to Las Vegas, number one is Trump, number two is Biden, but number three is Michelle Obama eight to one. Number four is Newsom.So if you were to pick and choose who you want to go up against Trump, maybe the fact that his team has have him gone on Seth Meyers, he is going to the border on Thursday, maybe this is their way of saying no Biden is going to be the nominee.Is that bad news for conservatives? Would you rather have Michelle go up against Trump? Would you rather have Newsom go up? Would you rather have Biden go on?This may actually be good, the fact that they haven't gone out there. Now obviously, we know the closest case study we have to Biden is Jimmy Carter. It's a low energy. It's not entertaining.If you go on a TV show or a podcast, you can always gauge if somebody is entertaining by what they talk about, by the number of viewership they get.On the channel that the video of the interview went on. There's two clips, one of them is 11 minutes. The other one is the shortcut with the glasses. The highest one has got 670,000 views. The one that should have gone viral has got 400,000 views on a channel with five million subscribers.What the market is saying, we're not interested in what President Biden has to say.WATTERS: He has no sizzle. He's never had sizzle. I'm just a little tired of the media trying to sell me sizzle that doesn't sizzle and we're sick of it and we're not going to be played for fools by it.But you're right, I don't want Michelle, I don't want Gavin, I don't even think they're in it. It's going to be Joe and Trump. But I do worry and many people agree that the kind of rabbits that they pulled out of their hat last time with the laptop, the letter, all of those shenanigans. There's PTSD from half the country over that, the mail-in ballots. That's a legit concern.BET-DAVID: I think that's all valid, but here's what happens. Data doesn't lie. When they come out and they tell us they want to put, you know, a border bill, $118 billion, and us who are willing to read and kind of go through the process, we say okay, $118 billion, you want to call it a border bill, then you break down the number. You notice out at $118 billion, $60 billion is going to Ukraine, only $20 billion is going to the border.Then two weeks later, since they noticed Congress is not going to let it pass, then they get rid of the border bill. Now, they want $95 billion minus the $20 billion.The American people are not done. They sit there and say you're playing with us. You're toying with us and this whole concept about, hey, he can't even remember his wife's name that the president is running with, Mercedes Schlapp that you talked about earlier being the CPAC host.These are -- these are many games they are playing with the American people. I'm convinced the 12 percent of Independent voters who really run everything. They're not going to fall for this trap.WATTERS: I hope so. And I agree, and they're banking on us not being able to read, but we're reading and we're actually reading better than Joe is off his own notecards.Patrick, thanks. As always, we really appreciate it.BET-DAVID: Anytime. Thank you.WATTERS: Well, Fox News is not welcome at the migrant hotels.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Please get off our property. All of you, please or I'm going to call the police immediately.You need to leave, please.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can't be looking at our computer.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Give me this (bleep) thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: There is one issue that's decided every presidential election for the last decade -- border security. Trump got elected on building a wall in '16. In '20, we couldn't protect our borders from a Chinese virus. This election year, the border is the top issue again. The second biggest concern the government -- see what's going on here.Now, this poll was taken before Biden's migrant murdered a college kid in Georgia and another Biden migrant sexually assaulted a kid in Virginia. So expect these numbers to go up.And it's not just safety, we're losing money. We're spending billions treating illegals like visiting foreign dignitaries, lavishing them with free hotel rooms, culturally appropriate meals, spending money, phones, college tuition, sex changes. Do not forget about the sex changes.But the government doesn't want you to know about it. Rachel Campos-Duffy tried checking into a secret migrant hotel in Arizona. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CAMPOS-DUFFY: What you're seeing is basically an unmarked building, all signage is removed. That's the first sign you know that this is an NGO, a non-governmental organization, in this case, Casa Alitas who is housing illegal immigrants.Let's go inside and see what happens.Let's try to rent a room.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh no, we don't rent rooms.CAMPOS-DUFFY: Why? Is this a hotel --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We don't -- can you guys get off the property, please?CAMPOS-DUFFY: Is this not a hotel?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you please exit the property? It is private property.CAMPOS-DUFFY: But is this where illegals are being housed with government funding?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you please get off our property. All of you, please, or I'm going to call the police.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You need to leave, please.CAMPOS-DUFFY: But I need to know what it is. Oh, Casa Alitas.This is Casa -- this is an NGO paid for by government money.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're not going to answer any of your questions.(RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY speaking in foreign language.)TRANSLATION: Can we talk? You can talk to us if you want to.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, no. Sorry. You guys cannot come into our shelter.CAMPOS-DUFFY: So you can see directions to a hotel.(RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY speaking in foreign language.)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can't be look at our computers.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now, when Rachel went back to the hotel later, security threw rocks at her car and bloodied up her cameraman.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are you going to do about it?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, touch me.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you (bleep) move. Move. Give me this (bleep) thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And they take our money and disrespect us.And if the government is so proud of their so-called compassion, why are they hiding it from cameras? Biden is paying his hotel owner donors with our tax dollars. He is importing foreign hotel guests to line the pockets of hotel CEOs and then hands you the bill.The migrants see us is rich whales they can squeeze.This Venezuelan migrant laid out the scam. Break in, drop a baby, and be a welfare king.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIGRANT (through translator): To all those women that find themselves pregnant and are in Latin America, please come have your baby in the United States. And if you get married, you'll get more back in taxes.And well, if you have five or six children, can you imagine? My daughter is American and she gave me citizenship. She pays our rent. She pays our bills.She gives us $1,500.00 a month since she was born. I have six months in the USA and I everything you don't have -- citizenship, residency, a good car, and a good apartment.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now when American women get pregnant, the government helps them stay single, work, and have an abortion. When a migrant gets pregnant, the government helps them cross the border, have the baby, get married, don't work, and put their handout.PRIMETIME producers crunched the numbers. A migrant family of four in New York could get over 20 grand a month in freebies, $500.00 a night at a hotel, $130.00 a day for food and having two kids in public school costs us five grand a month.We didn't even tack on Mayor Adams' $1,000.00 cash gift cards, the free health care at the ER, the free phones and free lawyers or the $400,000.00 in free college tuition per DREAMer.Meanwhile, taxpayers with jobs in New York pay thousands to live in a closet.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Welcome to my 80 square foot apartment that I pay $1,750.00 for.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This apartment is one, two, three, four, five steps long.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm basically living in an RV or van without wheels.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: New Yorkers aren't stupid. They're seeing migrants living large on the news while they get pounded for rent and groceries.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These guys are receiving like four grand a month. Four grand a month to live in hotels and buy things and so I am like, aren't we the ones in need? The people from the United States?On top of that, we're giving away money to other countries. We're the ones in need, like, this is -- this is ridiculous. That's why I've never voted in my life and I'm voting this year for Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: I say we flip it. Walk to Mexico, claim asylum because the libs are persecuting me. Emma has another baby. Oh my God, and wait for the checks to roll in.Kevin O'Leary is the chairman of O'Leary Ventures.Kevin, this is really audacious, what not only our government is doing, but what these migrants are doing.KEVIN O'LEARY, CHAIRMAN, O'LEARY VENTURES: Well, clearly the 2016 election that had this as you pointed out earlier, the number one issue, it has changed a little bit this time. First of all, its policy unresolved that is turning back into politics, and that is a little unusual, because right now, on a bipartisan basis, this is the number one issue.But now, it is at the state level because the cities that have turned into migrant sanctuaries are burdened with this incredibly expensive metric that you're detailing here, but it is not just New York, Chicago has got issues, many cities have issues.And all of a sudden the people that vote and here we are, nine-and-a-half months, 10 months away from the election, are realizing the impact of this unresolved 2016 issue now hitting them right in their own jurisdiction and so, I predict this probably becomes the number one and maintains that status, as both sides turn this into a huge fight.But now, it has hit home. I mean, New York has got lots of other problems these days, but this one is getting up to the top of the New York charts. And I think that's going to make it even more unstable, and really going to really -- it would be a very interesting outcome in terms of a general election.WATTERS: What does this do though, to the country's foundation? If you have overwhelming waves of migrants moving into these gorgeous cities, and then bankrupting these cities. The services aren't as good. The streets aren't as good.And a lot of the families living in the cities move out because they can't afford it and don't want to deal with the drama. And then they go to the counties and they go to the suburbs. What does this do to the country at large?O'LEARY: Well, that's already happening. The competition of states started five years ago, when all of a sudden, taxes and inefficiencies in poorly- run jurisdictions started seeing people leave, and you can count San Francisco is one of those places, you can now count the state of California. You can count the 1,200 license plates that are changed into Florida from New York State every day, and so that's happening anyways before the migrant issue hit.The more successful states like Tennessee, if you look at Nashville, it's the fastest growing city in America have figured out a way to deliver goods and services on a very competitive basis.This is really about management. It actually is about management. Some cities are well-managed, some states are well managed and others are not. And now post-pandemic, we have the competition of states and I frankly think it's healthy.WATTERS: I do, too and it is hurting the punching power of these blue states because you know what? They punch themselves in the face.Kevin, thank you so much.O'LEARY: Take care.WATTERS: So what politicians do the Chinese own? We will name names.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year, China is conniving. They take our tech with spies and our lives with drugs and viruses. So why is the government letting tens of thousands of mysterious Chinese nationals sneak through the border?Tonight, a bombshell book by Peter Schweizer, "Blood Money" explains everything.We knew the Chinese paid the Biden family millions. Tonight, we're learning more about where the money is coming from.The Chinese chairman who was showering the Biden's with cash and diamonds was working with a man known as White Wolf. He was the leader of a Chinese syndicate called the United Bamboo Gang.The White Wolf was partners with the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. The wolf helped turn that cartel into the world's largest fentanyl traffickers. The White Wolf was close with the Chinese government and the Chinese government sees Mexico as a borrowed knife to slit our throats.So Chinese gang leaders tied to the Sinaloa we're paying the president's family and that same president made the same cartel filthy rich.It's interesting.Schweizer's book also exposes Gavin Newsom's China connections. Back when Newsom was mayor, he was rolling with a Chinatown gangster known as Shrimp Boy. Who is Shrimp Boy?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KTVU REPORTER: In September 1977, Chow, then 17 survived a shootout known as the Golden Dragon massacre in a restaurant with rival gang members. Five people were killed.The self-described Son of the Underworld says his life of crime started when he was eight years old in Hong Kong where he was born. He says it continued when he immigrated to San Francisco when he was 16.RAYMOND "SHRIMP BOY" CHOW, SELF DESCRIBED SON OF THE UNDERWORLD: I sold drugs. I robbed people. From the little, little hustler, I've become the bigger hustler. That's it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Even with that rap sheet, Newsom sent Shrimp Boy's organization San Francisco tax dollars. Shrimp Boy was rubbing elbows with California's political elite like Dianne Feinstein, who had a Chinese spy driving her around for 20 years.Shrimp Boy told Newsom he was squeaky clean. But a couple of years, he got popped.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KTVU REPORTER: He became the leader, the so called Dragon Head of Ghee Kong Tong, a Chinese fraternal association in Chinatown in 2006.The most serious charges against Chow was murder. In court this month, he was convicted of being involved in the 2006 killing of another Chinatown leader, Allen Leung.CHOW: I'm innocent. I did not kill nobody. I did not tell anybody talk about anybody I wanted to kill anybody.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: After Shrimp Boy got locked up, Newsom told the press: "Boy, I really wish I didn't have that picture." This is just the tip of the iceberg."Blood Money: Why the Powerful Turn a Blind Eye While China Kills Americans" dives deep into our politicians' filthy relationships with the Chi coms.Peter Schweizer is the author of that book. He joins us now.Peter, before we get to Newsom, tell me about this Wolf that is related to these cash payments to the Biden family.PETER SCHWEIZER, PRESIDENT, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE: Yes, White Wolf is this very powerful figure. He is pro-CCP. He works with the Chinese government, but he is the head of UBG, this gang, and this gang is widely recognized as the organization that made the Sinaloa Cartel the kings of fentanyl.They told them how to make it, they helped them get pill presses. They helped provide communication devices.So the Chinese helped the Mexican cartels so they can communicate securely without the Americans knowing and they also helped them launder their money.He was partners with this individual, the head of CEFC who sent $5 million to the Biden's, so the question, Jesse, is does Joe Biden really want to have a conversation about Chinese involvement with fentanyl? I think we all know the answer is no based on this evidence.It also though goes to the Biden family attorney, Abbe Lowell, who is legally represented another guy who is the head of a criminal syndicate that is also involved in the drug trade.So there are a myriad of relationships in Biden world with Chinese organized crime connected figures.And now we have an organized crime situation in San Francisco. It's like anytime you hear anything about San Francisco, whether it's Swalwell, Feinstein. Now Newsom, I mean, the Chinese have that town pretty much wired. What's going on there?SCHWEIZER: They do.But you have the same problem with Chinese organized crime. I mean, in "Red Handed," you and I talked about that book.We talked about the CCP connections in the United States. Now, it is even worse because it includes criminal elements. So in the case of Gavin Newsom, consider this.He appointed as the head of redevelopment in Chinatown when he was mayor, a figure who was a dragon head in Chinese organized crime involved in the drug trade.He had guy in his transition team that was involved. When he set up China SF, he picked a organized crime figure to partner with him on that. He is surrounded by people that have these ties.WATTERS: Maybe that's why he had such a great time when he visited Beijing. I mean, it was just -- he was amongst friends. That's how it goes.Peter, great book. We have it right here. We've got "Blood Money." Another Peter Schweizer blockbuster. I'm reading this. I've got to finish the Dr. Phil book.Why am I promoting all of these books when we have "Get It Together" about to come out? Well, we'll promote it later.Peter, thank you so much.SCHWEIZER: Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Well, the FBI and White women, what you need to know.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: America has a little bit of a smash-and-grab problem. Now in Wisconsin, thugs pulled off a crash-and-grab with a truck at a Volvo dealership. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: This video captured inside Fields Volvo in Waukesha around six Sunday morning. A group of people, all wearing black running through the dealership while business is closed.Moments later, this, an SUV rams through the dealership's garage.Police say the thieves stole nine luxury cars from the dealership. This incident eventually prompted a police chase starting in Milwaukee County and ending in Kenosha.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: One of those thieves was a 17-year-old, a high schooler. His crew stole nearly $600,000.00 in autos, and in California, free sex changes and iPhones.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: Don't worry, everybody. The FBI is on it. The Bureau just announced it is finally cracking down on retail theft, and they know exactly who to blame. Rich White girls.This is who the FBI made the face of the retail crime wave, two White chicks who probably steal handbags to pay for their Lulus and Starbucks.Now ask yourself, when you hear about a smash-and-grab in your neighborhood, do these two women come to mind? Francesca and Addison? What's the FBI doing here?Host of "Tomi Lahren is Fearless" on Outkick, Tomi Lahren joins us now.Tomi, these girls look like you.TOMI LAHREN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I guess that Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift and Tomi Lahren look alike, so the new face of organized retail thrift. I'm so glad to see that the diversity, equity and inclusion apparently didn't reach the FBI because they decided to go the other way and just cast all White people as the problem.You know, Jesse, I wish I hated anything. I mean, really, hated anything as much as liberals hate White people in 2024 because this is really reaching a fever pitch.Not only do you have this, but you have Google's AI Gemini generator that seems to be getting history wrong, you know, White people didn't actually accomplish anything great.So I think we have a real anti-white problem. I'm glad that the FBI is you know, finally tackling retail theft though and I'm glad that these young ladies are finally being called out on their BS.WATTERS: Do you think if they were doing something on the threat to Latin American drug trafficking they'd put two Eskimo women on the picture? Like are they afraid of being called racist if they put African-Americans, Hispanics anybody besides White girls?LAHREN: Yes, I think so. I think that they saw all the heat that companies like Disney were getting for not having -- you know, for having too much diversity, casting everybody as a person of color or some kind of a disenfranchised group.So the FBI said we're not going to fall into that. We're going to go the complete other direction and we're going to whitewash everything and apparently they hit the mark. They hit the target right there because it is definitely very, very White.WATTERS: All right, besides hearts, Tomi, have you ever stolen anything?LAHREN: No, I haven't, Jesse. But you know what? Maybe I will be inspired by these young ladies who somewhat look like me. Maybe that'll be my inspiration to get into organized retail theft.WATTERS: All right, just remember keep it under $900.00 and you'll just be fine with a misdemeanor.Tomi Lahren --LAHREN: In California.WATTERS: If you see her in Macy's, watch your hands.Seattle cancelled a comedy show, but they're fine with drugs, crime, and homelessness.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: People in Seattle are willing to put up with a lot of crap. Migrants showing up by the busload, eh, just put them up at the hotels. Tweakers croaking in the streets, more needles. Record homicides last year, probably White supremacy. And get rid of the cops while you're at it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Violent crime is up 25 percent. Do you feel safe?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I do. I feel very safe here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've never seen any crime in Seattle.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've never heard of anyone getting robbed.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Crime is a social issue that could be solved by giving people their basic needs.BELISARIO: Seattle decriminalized drug use and then they criminalize it again.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh my God. Who are you getting these facts from? You're from New York, apparently you're listening to the wrong people.BELISARIO: I saw a lot of people shooting up on my way down here.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you? Okay. And they were bothering you?BELISARIO: I was in a car, but --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, no. You're in a car. Oh no, they were hurting you so bad. Oh no.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But they have to draw the line somewhere. Conservative comedians are the real danger and laughing at their jokes is a hate crime.A Seattle Comedy Club has just canceled four slightly right of center comedians, after saying they received complaints from local activists that the comedians don't align with the neighborhood's progressive ethos.In an e-mail to the comedians, the Capitol Hill Comedy Club said: "To avoid any potential negative impact on both our club and the artists involved, as well as to maintain the harmony within our community, we believe the most responsible course of action is to not move forward with the shows." Let's hear some of these hateful jokes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURT METZGER, COMEDIAN: A guy from the CDC goes on the news and goes good news everybody, we just emergency approved a new vaccine for COVID-19 and I think African-Americans should have first access to it.I was like what Black people do you guys know?Good news, Black people. We just emergency approved like really fast. A brand new vaccine. And you get to try it first.JIM FLORENTINE, COMEDIAN: Look, I would like a Netflix special. I've got to be honest, but I'm a middle aged White male. I got no shot.The only way I get a Netflix special at this point is if I transition, then I'll get one. Like if I become Jasmine Florentine, I'll have one within a year.LUIS J. GOMEZ, COMEDIAN: I think it's great that the Little Mermaid is . Now they're calling it Lil' Mermaid. L-I-L apostrophe mermaid. And Lil' Mermaid, she can't swim. That's the thing.The whole movie, she is just sitting on a suit braiding her cousin's hair smoking a blunt. That's the entire movie.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Canceled comedian, Jim Florentine joins me now.So Jim, were you like at the club ready to go up when they gave you the hook?FLORENTINE: No, I wasn't even booked till October. I just got booked two weeks ago. And you know, tickets were on sale. I was selling and all of a sudden, we get this e-mail. No, you're cancelled along with the three other comics.WATTERS: What were the activists so upset about? Had they ever even heard you before?FLORENTINE: I don't think so. I don't know. You know, I mean, they didn't even see my act what I'm doing now. You know, I talk about my pronouns. I talk about people of color. You know, I talk about transitioning. I've got to put a pink streak in my hair. So I don't know why they canceled me.WATTERS: Do you feel upset by this? Or do you think this is going to help your career?FLORENTINE: I think it's actually going to help. You know, at first I was, I laughed about it. But then I got all of these different venues in the area go we'll have you there. We'll have you there. So it is a club 20 minutes away, the Tacoma Comedy Club goes, we'll have you. So they booked me for that weekend.WATTERS: There you go.FLORENTINE: Which is great.WATTERS: Have you ever actually had one of these local activists come up to you in person face-to-face and said anything to you? Or is it usually just anonymous?FLORENTINE: Never. They never do. I perform in New York City all the time. One of the biggest liberal cities. No one has ever said anything ever. They don't care. If they don't like the joke, they just don't laugh.WATTERS: Right. I mean, or you don't have to go to the show. I don't understand how a show, which is in an enclosed building would in any way affect anything in this so-called community.FLORENTINE: Especially all four of us have our own following so all of our fans were to come to that club. It wasn't like people just going to walk off the street. They researched the comics and they go, that's not my style of comedy.So all of our fans who are going to come to that club, so I don't see what the problem was going to be.WATTERS: So your fans were going to come to the club, spend money in the city, buy drinks in this town, help this neighborhood economically and they said you know what? I don't think you're that funny and you're offensive. Let's just lose money.FLORENTINE: Exactly. And maybe step on some homeless poop, too. Our fans would have done that, too. But other than that, it is just crazy.Look, it's not like I haven't got canceled before, you know, so I get it. You know, other clubs have done it. Plus, I've been -- I got divorced. That's like getting cancelled.WATTERS: That's true. And Gutfeld --FLORENTINE: You know, but at least I still -- you know --WATTERS: Gutfeld cast --FLORENTINE: Where I didn't lose half my cash. Right, Gutfeld cast me. Plus, I didn't lose half my cash and my big screen TV. So.WATTERS: There you go. No smash-and-grabs.FLORENTINE: I am doing the club 20 minutes away now. Cancel culture is over, I think. Shane Gillis just hit "Saturday Night Live." He got you know, fired from there. So, we're all good.WATTERS: I think we're all good. You're going to have your big screen, you're going to have your better venue, and they can have their ethos. How about that?Jim, thank you so much.FLORENTINE: I don't even know what that word means. I don't even know what ethos means. I had to look it up.WATTERS: I didn't even know how to pronounce it. I just -- I winged it and I think I might have gotten it right. Thank you so much.All right, we're going to skip the Window.Bud from Rochester, New Hampshire: Someone needs to tell Biden that talking to someone with sunglasses on is rude. It should be eye to eye.Russ from Ohio: The Aviators are a cover in case he nods off.I think everybody watching that show nodded off.Mike from -- excuse me, Cecil from Pineville, Texas: My mother always told me that rich White women were trouble.Tell me about it.I'm Watters. This is my world.
