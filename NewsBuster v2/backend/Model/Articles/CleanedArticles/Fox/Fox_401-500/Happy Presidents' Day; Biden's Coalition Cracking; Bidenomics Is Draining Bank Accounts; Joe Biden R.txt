LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Whatever we're calling it now, and I'll consider actually asking those questions and we'll be in Greenville, South Carolina.I am very excited. This is going to be foreign policy, domestic policy, legal policy, the weaponization of government, the border, all the issues we care about.Jesse is next.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER US SECRETARY OF STATE: He wants to be a dictator on day one.He wants to round up people because of the way they look.He wants to bend the government of the United States to his will just like Vladimir Putin did to Russia.WATTERS: Democrats are now the boy who cried wolf.ANNA COULTER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: If it were a White man shooting, we'd know.BILL MAHER, HOST, "REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER": Well, we don't know that. I mean --COULTER: That's how we know it's not a White man. I can tell you that much.WATTERS: Is the media hiding Black shooters?CRAIG CALLAWAY, FORMER PRESIDENT OF ATLANTIC CITY, CITY COUNCIL: Well, sometimes, you know, the rules and laws get in the way. Use, you know some of the things that the Democrats useWATTERS: PRIMETIME thinks Craig the stuffer could be right.Plus --Happy Presidents' Day.JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: What was Abe Lincoln famous for?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Lincoln logs.WATTERS: Happy Presidents' Day. I'm working, you're not. I'm not mad about it.President John Quincy Adams once said, if your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you're a leader.Since the days of George Washington, American presidents have led Americans into doing great things. Washington mobilized his men at Valley Forge to defeat the British. Abraham Lincoln stood on the blood-soaked grounds of Gettysburg, where he inspired Americans to look at the Civil War not as a political struggle, but as a fight for human freedom.FDR's Fireside Chats inspired the nation during the depression and the Second World War. JFK inspired the country to go to the moon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN F. KENNEDY, JR., FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Why some say the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Those presidents were all the main characters of their time, but in today's times, we have Joe Biden.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD, PODCAST HOST: He's just an uninspiring candidate. Like you know, there's nothing about, you know, Joe Biden that makes you want to listen to him. He should be leaning on people who have -- are more inspiring than him, who are more charismatic than him and he should just be, I guess, if you want to call it the brains of the operation, behind- the-scenes. Like that sounds crazy that we're saying that about a president of the United States of America, but he has no main character energy at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Joe Biden's never had main character energy. He spent his career plagiarizing from the main characters.And my liberal family members visited me this weekend and they are wetting the bed. Why can't Joe Biden just go out and sell his accomplishments? Why can't Joe Biden say this is what Trump did, this is what I did and this is what I'll do in the future. I held my tongue, but they'll learn, Joe Biden isn't capable of these things.Main characters know how to campaign. Their instincts drive them to lead. Joe Biden is told how to campaign, and now Democrats are considering telling him not to.Listen to "The New York Times."(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is not up for this. He is not the campaigner he was even five years ago.A campaign has certain assets, but the most desirable asset is the candidate, and the Biden campaign does not treat Biden like he's a desirable asset.Step one, unfortunately, is convincing Biden that he should not run again. I think Biden as painful as this is, should find his way to stepping down as a hero, that the party should help him find his way to that to being the thing that he said he would be in 2020, the bridge to the next generation of Democrats.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now the cries for Biden to step down have never been louder. Nate Silver, the Democrats' polling wizard said if Biden doesn't improve, he's going to lose. Now, all Nate Silver does all day is stare at polling numbers and he says Biden is doomed if he doesn't turn it around.But Joe is up against Father Time, he can't improve. He falls asleep at funerals. He shakes hands with ghosts. And that's easy mode. The coalition is cracking and the squad is now saying don't vote for Joe in the primary.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI): It is also important to create a voting bloc, something that is a bullhorn to say enough is enough. We don't want a country that supports wars and bombs and destruction.Right now, we feel completely neglected -- neglected and just unseen by our government. If you want us to be louder, then come here and vote "uncommitted."(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Oh uncommitted. Tlaib better be careful. The FBI is going to find gold bars in her closet.But life is too expensive to put up with Biden's incompetence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My credit score is 800. I'll be 25 in two (bleep) weeks, yet my car insurance in the last two years went from 220 to 270, now to 320.I give them a call. They said, sorry, there's nothing we can do. We're getting calls. Our phones are off the (bleep) hook. I'm paying nearly eight hundred, nine hundred dollars a month for a Nissan Rogue Sport. Do you know that? I'm paying a thousand dollars a month to not look masculine at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Lyndon Johnson, who had his credibility shot during Vietnam and saw the writing on the wall as a younger and more inspiring candidate, RFK was eyeing the White House. He chose country over ego and announced he wouldn't run for re-election, but Biden is the most stubborn man in Washington.He proposed to Jill five times before she said yes. Now, if I were a Democrat, I'd be worried, too. Biden hasn't shown me anything.He is even complaining about "The New York Times." A Democrat president is complaining that "The New York Times" is mean.The publisher, Sulzberger said today: "He is a historically unpopular incumbent, and the oldest man to ever hold this office. We've reported on both of those realities extensively and the White House has been extremely upset about it."Now, the last Democrat to complain about "The New York Times'" unfair coverage was Hillary and we know what happened there. And here she is, again, stuck on repeat, warning voters that Trump and Putin are buddies.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: He wants to be a dictator on day one. He wants to round up people because of the way they look. You know, they may or may not be undocumented, it doesn't matter to him. He wants to call out the army to do that.He wants to use, you know, the Insurrection Act to militarize American law enforcement. He has a whole team of right wing thinkers, so to speak, who are coming up with an agenda called Project 2025.He wants to rid the government of any kind of independent expertise.He wants to bend the government of the United States to his will, just like Vladimir Putin did to Russia.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Hillary fell for the dictator on day one hoax and says Trump is going to round up people and put them in camps like FDR. And are we really doing the Russia thing again?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD, PODCAST HOST: You can't keep saying that there's a threat to democracy and democracy as we know it is going to be gone, but not act like it.And the other problem is, they've always done this with every single Republican candidate. Since I've been alive, whoever the Republican presidential candidate has been, they've demonized.It doesn't matter who it is. It doesn't matter if it's John McCain, it doesn't matter if it was, you know, Mitt Romney. It doesn't matter who it is, they will demonize the Republican candidate and not just an actual legitimate threat right there in our faces. They're like the party who cried wolf. Nobody believes them.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Last time Charlemagne said that Joe Biden told him "You ain't Black." Not the most inspiring Biden slogan and we know it's his, because he didn't plagiarize it.Nick Di Paolo is the host of "The Nick Di Paolo Show." He joins me now. A lot going on this weekend. How do you think this is going to shake out, Nick?NICK DI PAOLO, COMEDIAN: Well, in full disclosure, I am Black. Let's start with that.How is it going to shake out? I can't believe we're even having this conversation. Even if he was 48 with a crap job he's done, it is insane anybody would vote for him, but --And as far as -- what did Charlamagne say? He's not even a main character energy. He couldn't be an extra in "Porky's II." His speeches -- Jesse, his speeches are so uninspiring. The last one he gave, the White House had to send out grief counselors for the 10 people who saw it live, and this is the first flag day I can remember where I actually saw Republicans and Democrats lowering the flag to half-mast in their front yard all over the country.And I'll give him one thing. To be fair, there is a -- there's a few people he inspires like I'd say, you know, the mentally challenged, the crazy, mentally ill people. They look at him and go. The guy has lost his mind. He's got the IQ of an avocado pit and he is leading the free world. We can do it.And also, I'd say young gymnasts, he kind of inspires.WATTERS: Why?DI PAOLO: See an 82-year-old guy do free somersaults and four cartwheels down the stairs. You know, and he is again, in his late hundreds, you're going to get excited about.Other than that --WATTERS: I mean, no one has ever fallen up the stairs.DI PAOLO: I can't believe we are having this discussion and what's frustrating is, we can't even yell at him because he's not making any of these decisions.WATTERS: No, and he couldn't hear it if we did.DI PAOLO: That's right.WATTERS: I want to play some sound of "The View," Nick. These are the people telling us that Joe Biden should not debate Donald Trump and listen to the reason why. Go.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": I don't think I need to see someone who has been twice impeached and is a disgrace and a one-term president with 91 counts facing him. I think it legitimizes him.I don't need to be gas lit by Trump. We all know who he is. We all know what he stands for.We also know that Biden debated him twice and just like sort of mopped the floor with him.JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": If Biden flubs, they are all over him. If Trump flubs -- who cares?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Okay, there's not going to be a debate because Biden might flub.DI PAOLO: Might flub. He's not going to be able to find the studio. Are you kidding me?I mean, I can't believe they keep they keep calling -- you know, Trump's going to be the dictator. He's got 91 indictments, all this stuff is baloney, number one. Number two, they're backing a guy who is trying to put Trump in jail, and they keep calling him the dictator, Trump.I don't know if they believe this, Jesse, or they get paid to believe it. I can't believe you got "The View" to talk without food in their mouth. That's the first clip I've ever seen.WATTERS: When, Charlamagne tha God and we have to call him that. That is his God-given name, tha God, when Charlamagne tha God goes out and says that he is not inspiring and the Democrats do this every time, Trump is a threat.They've demonized every Republican and now no one believes them anymore. How worried does tha God sound?DI PAOLO: I think tha God is more upset about the crack from Biden a year or two ago when he said if you don't vote for me, you're not Black. That doesn't fly well on Black radio stations. I tried it a couple of times on the road and I was asked to leave. But look, I'm still there. I'm on your show.WATTERS: Okay.DI PAOLO: So hey, how about Colbert melting down?WATTERS: Yes.DI PAOLO: Geez. He is freaking out so much that even when they put the camera on his audience, they look a little depressed. I saw happier faces in the waiting room at Sloan Kettering.They do not -- they are getting scared of him. He's like -- he is like a robot that blew a gasket. Nobody knows how to shut it off. AndJohn Oliver is lecturing us now. Please go back to the UK, John. He said he's going to pay Clarence Thomas a million dollars a year if he quits the US Supreme Court. I was going to say, I'd pay John Oliver a million dollars a year to quit comedy, but it dawned to me he hasn't tried it yet.WATTERS: Yes, very good, Nick. I think if Trump becomes president, he might get deported. We're not encouraging any deportations of John Oliver. We would never do that. But he could be on the list.DI PAOLO: I will. I'm not on Fox -- I don't represent Fox. I'll say it.WATTERS: Okay, dictator on day one, John Oliver back to England.Nick, thank you so much.Johnny celebrates Presidents' Day.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Abe Lincoln had a very famous line. A house divided cannot --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Multiply.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Craig, but you know that's not right.CALLAWAY: What's not right?BELISARIO: Rigging elections and using fraudulent ballots. People say you've --CALLAWAY: I have no comment. I would appreciate if you get up and move away from me.Get out of my face, so I don't have to lay one of these bastards down.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That was Craig Callaway threatening to lay down Johnny, something I've wanted to do for years, but HR won't let me.Craig spent time in prison for bribery and sexual blackmail and was just indicted for rigging elections. He is a ballot harvester's ballot harvester.He's even an FBI informant. Go figure. Craig has been a political operative in New Jersey for decades working for Democrats most of his career.He was accused of voter fraud before, but wasn't arrested until he started working with Republicans, and now he feels betrayed. So he is telling Republicans the secrets of harvesting and is open for business.Craig the stuffer spoke at a conservative fundraiser this weekend. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CALLAWAY: Craig Callaway will never ever be a Democrat again in life.When I started making the transition into including others into my work, that's when the Democratic Party turned on me and others into my work, that's when the Democratic Party turned on me and it's been a battle ever since.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Craig better be careful. Black Democrats switching parties could be dangerous.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CALLAWAY: My lawyers have told me be very, very careful to what you say because it can and will be used against you.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But Craig can't help himself and he told the Republicans, if you want to beat a Democrat, you have to harvest like one.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CALLAWAY: The genie is out of the bottle. I don't think we're ever getting it back in. So we have to, you know, you have to use you know, some of the things that the Democrats use. When you lose by a few votes, don't say they cheated, work harder and outdo them.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Is Craig saying Republicans need to out cheat the Democrats? We're not sure. But we are sure where Craig thinks the money should go -- to him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CALLAWAY: The problem that the Republican Party has is they spend a whole lot of money on traditional way of voting, it is not going to work. You're going to lose, you're going to continue to lose all the elections.If you continue to spend all your money, on people or only consultants who are just bringing out the same votes, you're going to continue to lose.You've got to add to the equation.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: If we are hearing Craig correctly, we think we agree. We're not saying Republicans need to start stuffing. We're saying since 70 percent of the country voted early or by mail last election, Republicans need to win that game. Stay within the spirit of the law as Craig so eloquently said, we just want to add to the equation. That's not against the law, isn't it?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CALLAWAY: You know, I'm not a law breaker, but I just want to get things done for people. And sometimes the rules and laws get in the way.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: When you start a sentence with "I'm not a law breaker, but" I understand why Craig's lawyers told him not to say anything.The rules and the law do get in the way. That's why we have them, but I probably shouldn't say that. Craig isn't the only one letting laws get in his way though. Outside of Houston, five of America's top hip-hop stars were all registered to vote in the same small house where none of them lived.Drake, 50 Cent, Chris Brown, Trey Songz, and The Game were all registered to the same Texas address. It was news to them, and news to us. How'd that happen?Our elections are so secure. Federal voting law loopholes make it easy for anybody to register whoever they want, wherever they want. All you need to know is the person's name and birthday. You can find it on Google. As a matter of fact, tomorrow I'm going to register everyone on "The Five" to vote for my address.So some prankster registered five celebrities to a random house in Texas and nobody knew until a reporter caught it. Imagine the prankster requests absentee ballots. That's five votes for Beto. Sorry about that, Senator Cruz. You need to get more Craigs in Texas.So if a prankster is getting away with shenanigans, imagine what a professional harvester can pull off.Your move, Republicans.Newt Gingrich is a former Speaker of the House and Fox News contributor.Do you see what Craig is getting at, Speaker? And do you kind of agree or not?NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, look, way back in 1973. I said in the Atlanta Constitution that Republicans have to win by at least a four percent margin just to offset Democratic vote stealing.The party of Tammany Hall has always stolen votes. They're very good at stealing votes. And I think we have to start with two different sides. One is Republicans have to get into the game of getting people to vote very early, getting them to go to the polls, vote by mail, do whatever.But I was very disappointed in the New York special election, where clearly the Republican National Committee's bank the vote effort had failed totally. So if you're not in the game, not even trying, you shouldn't expect to win.But in addition, Scott Rasmussen recently did a report and said that among the top one percent, the people who are the head of NBC News, ABC News, the head of all the bureaucracies, among those folks, 67 percent said they will be glad to steal an election, if that's what it took.Now, that is like 10 times the national Average. So you have to start with the idea that to beat Donald Trump, these folks are going to vote early, they are going to vote often, they're going to cheat. They're going to do everything they can.And Republicans need to understand, they need lawyers who are as tough, as ruthless, as aggressive and they need to get into the fight, and they need to get into the fight, certainly, by the end of July, because the elections now are so much longer than we're used to. And all too many Republican consultants haven't caught up with reality.WATTERS: No, well I mean, it is too late if it is July, Speaker.GINGRICH: So, I think your report is exactly on target.WATTERS: They should have been after this since the last election on, day one.Craig, though, doesn't see it as stealing, Speaker. Craig sees it as adding to the equation.GINGRICH: Why would you ask somebody who is a crook to describe himself as a crook, when he can explain, he was only borrowing a few things permanently? And I think Craig is a perfect example of that. All I would say, and I thought, it was a great segment by the way, all I would say is, everybody who wants an honest election should know that in the long run, we need the French model, everybody votes on the same day. Everybody has a photo ID, everybody is accounted as a person.But until we get to that, if Republicans want to win this year, under the rules that exist this year, they need to outvote the Democrats by about five percent, which is a margin big enough that it can't be stolen.They need to have everybody they can get to vote very early, so they can focus on the late voters and get them out and they need to have the largest possible number of volunteers in Philadelphia, in Milwaukee, in Chicago, across the country, trying to stop voter theft and it will be a --Look, this is a real fight.WATTERS: Yes.GINGRICH: The Democrats understand --WATTERS: Oh, it is going to be straight fight. No doubt about that.GINGRICH: This is life and death.WATTERS: All right, Newt Gingrich saying we need to emulate the French. I never thought I'd hear him say that. But if it works, it works.Speaker, thank you so much.GINGRICH: What can I say?WATTERS: Fox News Alert: The FBI informant who Biden arrested for fingering him in the Ukraine bribe scheme has hired two high powered attorneys to represent him. These lawyers have worked with Paris Hilton, Janet Jackson, Robert Durst, and Martha Stewart. So this guy is not playing around.They have a hearing tomorrow where they will try to get the FBI informant released from custody and we have invited the lawyers on to talk about the case, so stay tuned.Ahead, why are Democrats protecting Black shooters?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: It's been five days since the deadly Kansas City Super Bowl parade shooting and we still don't know the identities of the shooters. Why? Within minutes of the shooting, fans tackled the suspects and held them until police handcuffed them. Since then, nothing.Kansas City says the suspects are minors so they can't speak about it. Well, except the Kansas City mayor is speaking. He is defending the suspects. Watch.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS, KANSAS CITY: I disagree strongly with how he would describe that situation. I certainly do think this was criminal activity. It was lawlessness. And I think that that's troubling.But "thugs" is a dog whistle in the most classic sense, and I have seen this dog whistle time and again.(END AUDIO CLIP)WATTERS: One dead, 22 injured and the mayor is doing PR for the shooters and the mayor just told us more about the suspects then the police have, they are minorities.We don't know that for a fact, but if they were White, I don't think the Black mayor would be mad that they were called thugs. What does he prefer? Disadvantaged youth? We don't know.How is the country supposed to fight crime when we can't talk about it? We can't talk about criminals. We're not allowed to talk about why they're criminals, how they became criminals, and what's allowing them to continue to be criminals?Journalists aren't even pursuing the story. These alleged Superbowl parade shooters get better treatment in the media than the Covington kid whose only crime was smirking with a MAGA hat, smirking with a MAGA hat, obviously, second degree felony.In the history of the Super Bowl, at the parade, there has never been a shooting. One dead, 22 injured including children and the press is not interested about where they got the gun, their records, their parents or their immigration status.They are protecting narratives more than lives.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COULTER: If it were a White man shooting, we'd know.MAHER: Well, we don't know that. I mean --COULTER: That's how we know it's not a White man, I can tell you that much.MAHER: Do you think they are repressing that reporting?COULTER: They wouldn't tell us about the transgender woman that shot up the Christian school for what -- like a year? Oh, San Bernardino out here. Remember? The crazy terrorist, Muslims? That's when I first noticed. Hmm. They're not telling us who it is. It is not a White male.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Dana Loesch is a nationally syndicated radio host.So the governor called these shooters "thugs." Now I don't know if they're White or Black, what they are? But then the Black Democrat mayor pops up and says don't call them thugs, that's a dog whistle.I guess, we can assume a little bit about their identity. But why is their identity and everything about this case, Dana, kept so hidden from the country?DANA LOESCH, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO HOST: Yes, that's a great question. Now, that's a great question, Jesse.And thug is interchangeable with criminal. I'm not doing this with Quinton Lucas. I'm not doing this with the mayor of Kansas City who is showing more concern for the feelings of the thug criminals than he is for the people who were shot, Jesse. That's the bigger picture here.The people who were shot -- and he is jumping to the defense of these criminals?I'm going to tell you something else about the press. The press doesn't care about Black lives. Black lives matter to the press when they can be leveraged politically. But when it comes to talking about why there's this breakdown in urban communities, when it comes to talking about oh, I don't know people like Rhonda Ezell and others in Chicago say, who had to fight to keep their Second Amendment rights, or maybe the breakdown in these suspects' homes that led to teenagers being out on the street with illegally possessed handguns.Suddenly, the press which professes to care so much about Black lives, Jesse, suddenly they are entirely disinterested, so they can spare me their faux outrage on this.And one last point on this, when you talk about the identities of these criminals in question, I also completely disregard from Quinton Lucas and any other official in Kansas City, that it's because they're minors, because that didn't really matter so much when it came to Kyle Rittenhouse, who was 17 years old, lawfully carrying a rifle, lawfully defending his own life against a White kid toucher and a White woman beater, both of whom had convicted records, but they had records of convictions, by the way, and there was the press, Jesse, who went out and said that Rittenhouse was shooting Black people.So I don't -- all of these people are using this as a deflection. There is a bigger issue here and it has nothing to do with guns.WATTERS: You're right. I mean, there's White thugs, Black thugs, Latin thugs. The word "thug" actually is derived from a Hindu phrase so it doesn't have anything to do with it, but the fact that it is a deflection tells you everything you need to know about this.Why do they want to deflect? If you're the mayor of Kansas City, why would you want to get into some sort of racial conversation and make this about some insensitivity? This has nothing to do with manners and labels. People are dead, people have bullet holes.LOESCH: It is a cop out for him. Yes, it is a cop out for him. He would have to -- he would have to be prevailed upon, Jesse, to explain. Why is it that Kansas City under years of Democrat administration is still having this problem.WATTERS: Right.LOESCH: In fact, he would have to explain why Kansas City's homicide rate increased by seven percent within the past year and St. Louis, Missouri is my hometown, St. Louis or home state, St. Louis is my hometown. St. Louis has actually decreased by 20 percent.And you have still, I think it was the National Shooting Sports Foundation that said about a million firearms purchased, almost a million firearms every month for 15 months straight. That's the introduction of a lot of privately legally owned firearms. So you would think that the homicide rate would skyrocket yet, it has not.It comes down to the administration, it comes down to enforcement, it comes down to penalty, recidivism, and the rot of restorative justice. He can't explain it, so he falls back on race.WATTERS: All right, and you do know the difference between Kansas City, Kansas, and Missouri a lot of people are very confused about it.LOESCH: They are required to as a Missourian. They test you to keep you in the state.WATTERS: Thanks so much, Dana.LOESCH: Thanks.WATTERS: The great crawl of China is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Illegals from across the globe are now bum rushing California. Border Patrol is now building makeshift migrant camps in the hot springs.Bill Melugin is there now.BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Jesse, good evening to you.Over my shoulder, you can see a large group of migrants who have just crossed illegally here, coming in from all over the world -- China, Africa, the Middle East, they're crossing in this very remote area about an hour east of San Diego and take a look at this remarkable footage we shot earlier this afternoon out here. A huge group of migrants scaling a massive mountain out here and crossing illegally into the US, very steep, very dangerous. A line of them almost as far as the eye can see at times coming down that mountain.We'll show you some other video we had earlier this morning. Take a look at this. This was groups of predominantly single adult men from around the world who are waiting for Border Patrol to take them into custody and process them this morning. Again, more from China, some from Kazakhstan, some from Turkey, others from the Middle East. That's just kind of how it's been out here.Some of them had been camped out since last night, and I had a chance to talk to some of them. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MELUGIN: Where are you guys from?MIGRANTS: Turkey.MELUGIN: Turkey?Where are you guys from?(BILL MELUGIN speaking in foreign language.)MIGRANTS: Ecuador.MELUGIN: Ecuador.Where are you guys from?MIGRANTS: China.MELUGIN: China?MIGRANTS: China.MELUGIN: China?What city in the US do you want to go to?MIGRANT: Los Angeles.MELUGIN: Los Angeles? LA? Los Angeles. Okay.(END VIDEO CLIP)MELUGIN: Meanwhile, over the weekend, take a look at this, Fox News cameras witnessing hundreds of Chinese nationals crossing illegally here into the Jacumba area as the number of Chinese is just skyrocketing here at the southern border and this is not normal.Just to put it in perspective for you, take a look at this graphic. CBP sources telling Fox, in the last four-and-a-half months since October 1st, more than 20,000 Chinese nationals have been encountered at our southern border. That is up more than 4,000 percent over all of fiscal year 2021 when there were only 450 Chinese encountered.And back out here, Jesse, the politics of the California border obviously, very different than Texas. There is no razor wire out here, no National Guard, no shipping containers.California is a sanctuary state. It just started offering health care to illegal immigrants and the state is doing nothing to try to stop any of what you see is happening behind me right now.We'll send it back to you.WATTERS: All right, let's talk to Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb.Mark, they are not only just offering health care. Illegal immigrants get free sex changes in California now.MARK LAMB, PINAL COUNTY SHERIFF: California has lost their mind, Jesse. I just -- and it doesn't help the rest of us when they do silly things like that, when they offer free sex changes, free health care, free housing. All that does is entice people to come here and we don't need that.WATTERS: What's going on with the Chinese influx. This is relatively new over the last few months.LAMB: It is somewhat new, Jesse, but there was 37,000 Chinese nationals last year. We're on task, we're on pace now. In four months, they've had 20,000. This is going to put us almost double what it was last year, and what I keep telling people, when you hear these numbers about Chinese nationals, it's not like America. People can't just come and go as they please out of a communist country.The Chinese government has to be complicit in this, and so when you see a number like 20,000 in the first four months, that is very alarming, especially when they are military age men -- Jesse.WATTERS: Do you think they're sending some of them spies? Some of them people that don't really want in the country? What do you think the mix is?LAMB: What I think is they see a very weak administration that is not committed to securing our border. And I think they can put as many people in this country, they will. They are taking advantage of a very poor situation that this administration has created.WATTERS: Right now, I don't know if you know this, but you can't get a hotel room in New York.
