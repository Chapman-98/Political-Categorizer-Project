LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: I don't know. Maybe that took me back and I just was like, that's kind of cool. I don't obviously remember that.RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: No, it is nostalgic.INGRAHAM: I like it.ARROYO: Sweet, but ineffective at this point. I mean --INGRAHAM: That was sweet, but ineffective. I agree with you wholeheartedly about these ads. They were lousy.ARROYO: Thank you.INGRAHAM: Raymond, thank you.ARROYO: Okay.INGRAHAM: Up next, Jesse Watters.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Is it too late for Democrats to change horses?JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: It's never too late. He is old. It's never going to get better.WATTERS: Joe Biden and the great replacement theory. RFK, Jr. is here.JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: How many years you've been rigging elections?CRAIG CALLAWAY, POLITICAL ORGANIZER: Get out of my face, before I have to lay one of these bastards down.WATTERS: PRIMETIME winnings a war on voter fraud.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)ANNOUNCER: First team goal. Mahomes wins the Super Bowl. Here is there. Hartman. Jackpot. Kansas City.WATTERS: What you need to know about Super Bowl LVIII with Sage Steele.Plus --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hey, you (bleep) me. You're funny (bleep) interviewer.BELISARIO: You think I'm funny?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not in a good way.WATTERS: The emperor has no clothes, you've heard the saying. It comes from a famous folk tale of a king swindled by a few con men into believing they would clothe him in magical garments, so special, so rich that only the wisest of men could see.When the swindlers draped him in their imaginary cloth, the king was too prideful to admit he didn't see a thing. The whole kingdom knew the king had no clothes, but his staff was too fearful and reluctant to break the news to the king. When he came out to the town square, the king was laughed off for being exposed and bear.For three years, Joe Biden has been America's emperor and the Democratic machine in the press had been his swindlers, lying and convincing him that he looked fantastic. But last week, the emperor was caught with no clothes.After the Hur report exposed the president is being painfully slow, doddering old man, with diminished faculties, Washington's secret was out although the rest of the country has known it for years. Eighty-six percent of Americans say Biden is too old to serve another term. The remaining 14 percent are Biden family members.It's a relief for everyone, no more pretending.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOB COSTAS, SPORTSCASTER: This is emperor's new clothes stuff. Joe Biden should have run on a firm promise that he would be a one-term president.(APPLAUSE)COSTAS: The Dems could have gotten a lot of people up in the bullpen and they could have sorted through those people. If Biden's hubris is such that he doesn't understand the best interest of his party and more important his country, then he has to be shown the door. Period.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The door is never been this wide open for switching out the ticket and the Democratic machine is shopping around.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARVILLE: He is old. I know what it is because I'm almost as old as he is and it's never going to get better.Today is the youngest you'll ever be for the rest of your life.DAVID AXELROD, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Public perception is formed by how you perform in front of the camera and on that I think the president has lost a step and it has hurt him.HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER US SECRETARY OF STATE: I talk to people in the White House all the time, and you know, they know it's an issue. But as I like to say, look, it's a legitimate issue.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Not only has Biden lost the consultant class, he has lost "The New York Times." The paper might as well have written Biden's political obituary this weekend. You ready?"Mr. President ditch the stealth about health.""Democrats can no longer stay silent about Biden.""Yes, Biden's age matters.""Question is not if Biden should step aside, it is how."Biden walked into the election year with two things in his back pocket, a friendly media and an army of lawyers to prosecute his political opponent.It is only February and Biden has already lost both. Behind-the-scenes, Biden has been grumbling to his advisers that Attorney General Merrick Garland should have moved sooner in his investigation into Trump.Now, Biden's re-election strategy is shot because Garland isn't going to get a conviction before November, and now Garland's job is on the line. Biden telling his staff the attorney general didn't rein in the special counsel's report.Biden is furious the report about his diminished faculties wasn't covered up. And now House investigators are demanding the Justice Department release the video of Biden's interview with the special counsel where he couldn't remember when he was vice president and didn't recall when his son died.Now if the president is all there upstairs, release the video and change the minds of 86 percent of the country. Biden is losing the legal war that he started and is now lashing out at his AG for not interfering in the election soon enough.The left realizes Biden can't hoax and convict his way back into the White House, so we're about to see an episode of Democrats speed dating.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SMERCONISH: Is it too late for Democrats to change horses?CARVILLE: In a sense, it's never too late. If you had a nominee and the nominee dropped dead in the last week of October, you'd have some mechanism to have a replacement.Lyndon Johnson dropped out in March 1968. We had a nominee. So it's never too late, but the later it gets, the more confusing the process gets.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden is useless with poll numbers this low. There is no honor in politics. Biden may not know it, but that convention in Chicago this August is a trap. He might lose his job before the election.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL MAHER, HOST, "REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER": I guess the question now is, is it too late? And I don't think it is because I still think you can do it at the convention. I don't -- and people have said to me, oh, that's ridiculous. They will look like nothing. Nobody give a (bleep) what you do.(APPLAUSE)MAHER: They'd be thrilled if they did it the day before the election. You could switch him out at the convention.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The Chicago massacre is being planned in broad daylight. "The New York Times" is the architect comparing Joe Biden to a light bulb that's burning out, who feels trapped by a floundering VP who has no chance of beating Trump in the general. "The New York Times" says Biden is left with two options, drop out and anoint Kamala or drop out and don't endorse Kamala and let the super delegates hash it out.But warning an aging white president knifing the first woman of color Veep would set up months of bloodletting and ideological drama. "The Times" is giving Biden a way to die with dignity. Go to the DNC with your delegates, drop out and let the super delegates and the Obamas pick the nominee.Remember, the super delegates aren't bound to Biden. They are free agents. Now, where does that leave Kamala?Well, just 48 hours after Biden's own Justice Department said he wasn't up for the job, Kamala announced she's "ready to serve." But no one believes her and Democrat donors are already playing the field.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KRISTEN WELKER, NBC NEWS: People are watching him and again 76 percent of them have those concerns, and so do some of his donors. This is what "The Washington Post" is saying: "Top Biden donors were fielding calls and text messages from anxious Democrats asking if other Democrats still had time to jump into the presidential race. When is Gavin getting in? Or how about Whitmer or Shapiro buzzed around Democratic circles over the last 24 hours."(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But the Democrat bench is so thin liberals are pleading for a savior.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SMERCONISH; Look at who Vegas oddsmakers are saying have the best chances of being elected this fall. Trump has five to six shot, it's better than even. Biden 15 to eight, a little better than two to one. Next in line, Michelle Obama, 11 to one, ahead of Nikki Haley, Gavin Newsom, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Kamala Harris.I don't know about you, David. I've got people in my orbit and my radio listeners say the same thing. There's like always a family member who says, in my case, it's my brother, keep your eye on Michelle Obama.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: By the way, Democrats are talking, it's a matter of when and by who they replace him with.Luckily, there's a doctor who can have this tough talk with the president, his wife, but Jill is just as stubborn as Joe is and is forcing him on TikTok.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chiefs of 9ers?JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Two great quarterbacks. Hard to decide, but if I didn't say I was for the Eagles, then I'd be sleeping alone. My wife is a Philly girl.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Game or commercials?BIDEN: Game.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Game or halftime show?BIDEN: Game.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jason Kelce or Travis Kelce.BIDEN: Mama Kelce. I understand she makes great chocolate chip cookies.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Deviously plotting to rig the season so the Chiefs would make the Super Bowl or the Chiefs just being a good football team?BIDEN: I'd get in trouble if I told.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump or Biden?BIDEN: Are you kidding? Biden.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is an independent running for president. He joins us now.So RFK, Jr., is Joe Biden fit to be president?ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think anybody can make up their mind about that, as well as I can. I hope that if he has the kind of cognitive challenges that the special counsel indicated he has, and if I were in that position, a member of my family or staff would approach me and assist me in gently stepping down.WATTERS: So, is that the role for Jill Biden to play right now?KENNEDY: What did you say?WATTERS: Was that the roll for Jill?KENNEDY: I think she should do it, and I think -- you know, I think what President Biden -- if President Biden wants to run because these issues have now been raised in a very, very public setting, he needs to come out and have unscripted discussions with voters, he needs to have a debate. Tell us what he is going to do about closing the border. Tell the American people what he is going to do about restoring the middle class, about ending the wars, the forever wars around the world, about unraveling corporate capture, and all of these issues that are critical to our country right now.And we need a president who is on the ball, somebody who we all trust top answer that phone call at three o'clock in the morning and to handle these -- the complexities and the nuances of the kinds of crises that face our country at a very, very critical point in history, and I think he needs to show people that he can do that and the best way to do that is an open debate.WATTERS: And that's tough for him because it's a catch 22, the more he goes out there to show he has what it takes, the more everybody sees that he doesn't.I was watching the game last night, and all of a sudden I saw a brilliant ad by your campaign or maybe a super PAC. Let's watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)Do you want a man for president who is seasoned through and through. A man who's old enough to know, and young enough to do. Well, it is up to you, it's up to you, it's strictly up to you.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So that was a classic Kennedy family ad that you repurposed, and then you apologized for running that ad. Why did you do that?KENNEDY: Well, you know, as you know, Jesse, there's a couple of members of my family that do not support my run for president and I knew that ad was not run by our campaign, it was run by the super PAC and I was delighted to see it.I was sitting with Cheryl and my kids and a lot of other family members watching the Super Bowl when that popped up, so you can imagine my surprise. Super PAC is not allowed to talk about those things with us, but I knew when I saw the ad, I love the ad, but I knew that it would be -- that it would irritate some members of my family because it used some of that old Kennedy iconography, so I don't apologize for the ad, but you know, I don't want to hurt people's feelings.And it is an easy thing for me to do, to say it's not the ad I would have run if I had chosen it. I'm very happy they did it. I think it was very creative, but it's -- I also know that it would hurt people and I don't want to hurt anybody.WATTERS: Yes, well, I hurt members of my family every night on JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME and on "The Five." Just that's what happens when you live in a diverse political family.RFK, Jr., thank you so much for joining us.KENNEDY: Exactly. Thank you, Jesse. People can go to Kennedy24.com.WATTERS: There you go.Well, PRIMETIME tracked down New Jersey's most notorious ballot stuffer, Craig.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: So last week, we introduced you to Craig Callaway, the Wanda of Atlantic City. Craig was arrested for election fraud in New Jersey. Just like Wanda, he is accused of harvesting and stuffing absentee ballots.Craig would allegedly pay people 50 bucks to forge signatures and forage for ballots inside of nursing homes. Craig, a Democrat even served a stint on the city council as president before being arrested for bribery and sexual blackmail.The known harvester is a hired gun for both parties and has been accused of rigging elections for years and bragging about it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CALLAWAY: Those votes by mails that came in, that over 700 came in when he was up by 200 or something, those came from who? It came from our organization.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: PRIMETIME is fascinated with Craig the stuffer. So we sent Johnny to Atlantic City this morning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Do you know Craig?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.BELISARIO: What do you think of him?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My honest opinion, piece of (bleep).BELISARIO: He was caught rigging elections.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Again, or just the same.BELISARIO: Again and again and again.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, that's wrong. That's really wrong. He should not do that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It sounds like corruption to me.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He was wrong. If he did it, it was wrong.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a pretty much norm in our elections. I mean, there is always someone that is going to try to skirt something around.BELISARIO: Is Atlantic City elections corrupt?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Always have been.BELISARIO: Are the elections in Atlantic City clean?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't believe so.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not really.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not for us, personally.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've heard of corruption. And honestly, when you look around, you can see that Atlantic City is not in the best conditions.BELISARIO: What's your message to Craig if he's watching tonight?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Go lay down and stay the (bleep) down. That's it. Go lay down. Enough is enough. Ain't you tired?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Nope, Craig is not tired at all. He's a busy man. He is so busy that he's been working for the FBI for 25 years. That's right.Craig, the ballot stuffer wears wires for the feds to catch people bribing government officials. But Craig the stuffer messed up and got caught taking bribes in an FBI sting. But don't worry, he cut a deal with the feds who just wired him back up for more stings. But then Craig got caught sexually blackmailing a minister in another sting.So Craig is a snitch and a stuffer. Does the FBI have ballot stuffers on the payroll? It's strange, because the Justice Department says Craig was caught with a stack of dirty ballot applications back in the midterms, but they didn't indict him until this year. Why wouldn't the FBI want clean midterms in Jersey? Why did they wait?Well, why don't we just ask Craig.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: How are you?CALLAWAY: I'm all right. Who are you?BELISARIO: Johnny from Fox.CALLAWAY: From Fox?BELISARIO: How's it going?CALLAWAY: It is going well. I'm all right.BELISARIO: Craig, how many years have you been rigging elections?CALLAWAY: Zero.BELISARIO: Zero years.CALLAWAY: Zero years. Never, never, never happened.BELISARIO: Craig, but you've been charged with rigging elections.CALLAWAY: I can charge you for something. They can charge you for anything. So, no.BELISARIO: Craig, but you know that's not right.CALLAWAY: What's not right?BELISARIO: Rigging elections and using fraudulent ballots. People say you've collected --CALLAWAY: I have no comment. I would appreciate it if you get up and move away from me. Get out of my face before have to lay one of these bastards down.BELISARIO: Craig, what about the people who said they didn't mail their ballots?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Alex Zdan is a Republican Senate candidate and former New Jersey corruption reporter who investigated Craig for years.Craig claims zero rigging. Does that add up?ALEX ZDAN (R), NEW JERSEY SENATE CANDIDATE: Well, look, Craig Callaway is one of the most charismatic corrupt criminals I've ever met and I don't know what he thinks he's doing, but it's definitely not on the up and up.He has gone out there and used charisma and charm to literally charm the vote out of your hands and then he sends his army of bums and winos he pays 30 or 50 bucks to collect that ballot under New Jersey's Messenger Law.Look, we know that voting by mail is safe. The problem is when you get folks like Craig Callaway as their delivery system, then you've got a problem. These bums and winos ransacked a liquor store right across from the Board of Elections Office in 2017 because they got their money right after they dropped off the ballots and what did they spend it on? Liquor.WATTERS: Oh Craig. You say he has charisma and charming, charismatic and charming -- he didn't look very charming with Johnny.ZDAN: Well, that's because Johnny is new. He is going to warm up to Johnny just like he warmed up to me.Craig is the kind of guy who -- listen, he has 10 or 12 charismatic brothers and sisters and they form the basis of his operation and in New Jersey, we know that Craig is not the only one.In this nation, only one state -- one state mandates that the voter him or herself must drop off the mail-in ballot. This messenger ballot system is a mess.We look at people like Bob Menendez who is incredibly accused 20 years ago of meddling in an election. And, you know, we all know how that story ended. Bob Menendez, if you're stuffed in a ballot box, it's easy to stuff your jacket and your pockets with gold bars and cash, but that's why I'm running to replace him.We send an investigative reporter to the US Capitol and the US Senate and it's an opportunity to crack down on corruption like nothing we've ever seen.We've got to clean up New Jersey. AlexForNJ.com is my website. I encourage people to join our movement. We're really gathering speed and strength and steam. We've got to clean up Washington. We'll start with you, Jesse.WATTERS: Alex, thank you so much, just suspicious that the FBI has a ballot stuffer and snitch on the payroll. I didn't see that coming, or perhaps I did.Good luck in the election.ZDAN: Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Well, we warned you, the war against machines begins. Humans burning robots in the streets of San Francisco.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: The border is broken, and so is the Biden White House. A new report reveals shouting matches, finger pointing, name calling at the highest levels of the administration because no one wants the blame or the responsibility for border security.Bill Melugin has the details -- Bill.BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jesse, AXIOS dropped an absolutely brutal article today that really pulls back the curtain on just how much infighting and dysfunction there has been in the Biden administration when it comes to the border crisis. So we'll talk about some of the highlights here.According to AXIOS, Biden adviser, Susan Rice privately called HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra a "bitch s" and an idiot over his handling of migrant children and also passed a note to DHS Secretary Mayorkas that read "Don't save him" as Biden was berating Becerra.Biden reportedly exploded in rage at his staffers on Air Force One while heading to the border last year after he demanded obscure border data and his staff didn't have it.AXIOS also reports DHS Secretary Mayorkas disagreed with Biden's initial 100-day halt on deportations that a Homeland Security adviser had to ask what the difference between refugees and asylum seekers is and that border czar, Kamala Harris' staff made it clear her responsibilities "began and ended with only the root causes in the Northern Triangle countries."AXIOS also reports: "As the humanitarian conditions at the border have deteriorated and the politics surrounding immigration have become a thorn for Biden, he becomes scratchier when the issue comes up according to current and former aides. There are definite incentives to not be the person who owns the scary issue with no solutions." That's according to a former government official.And Jesse, the Biden administration does deny much of what AXIOS reported today, but it should also be pointed out, the administration has shifted their language on the border in recent days, all of a sudden we have Biden saying the border isn't secure and Mayorkas suddenly calling this situation a crisis, a word he's never used before, he has always called it a challenge.Send it back to you.WATTERS: All right, Bill, thanks so much.He didn't get the cocaine hippos assignment, but he's got a new Fox Nation special, "24/7: Border Crisis," which is available right now. Thank you so much.They tell us self-driving cars are the future, but right now they're a menace to society. Companies are racing to see who can crank out the flashiest models sending them onto the streets before they're ready for primetime, and people have had it.This weekend, a raucous crowd in San Francisco blew up a self-driving car with fireworks. The fire-bombing taking place during a celebration of the Chinese New Year.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: Now perhaps it's a new Chinese New Year ritual PRIMETIME is unaware of, you know, we're not the most culturally sophisticated program. No one has been arrested. Is that because the robot car declined to press charges or because property crime is a victimless crime in California? We're not sure.Like the Battle of Princeton and Trenton consumed New Jersey during the Revolutionary War, San Francisco is seeing its fair share of armed conflict. Last year, police struggled to impound a runaway robot. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OFFICER: No, you stay. (Bleep). I don't trust this AI.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Bad robot. Down boy, and that was just one robot on wheels.In Austin, Texas robot cars formed a mob and barricaded people into their homes, so the cars are programmed to stop for red lights. So when a storm hit and the lights got stuck on red, this happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These dumb cars are not even going to move. Are you telling me, we have no way to get out of these?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: These things are only as smart as the people who make them and the people who make them all voted for Biden.Adam Carolla is a "New York Times" bestselling author and the host of "The Adam Carolla Show." Adam I did not see residents of San Francisco taking up arms against anybody. This story really caught us by surprise.ADAM CAROLLA, COMEDIAN: It is funny that all this is going on in San Francisco because you know Summer of Love, Haight-Ashbury, Jerry Garcia, Grateful Dead. Remember, it was all groovy and free to be you and me? Now, it's all defecation on the streets and burning robotic cars. Like, when did hippies become weaponized?WATTERS: I think that was too much LSD in the bloodstream. I did not know that robots would be on the losing end of this battle for humanity. I was always told, Adam that they were going to take over, destroy us and put us to death and make us slaves. This kind of gives me hope for the people.CAROLLA: Yes, I mean, maybe if we can slay the first generation of robots, the second generation that was going to take us over in some apocalyptic fashion will back off and move to another planet.But yes, I grew up watching the "Terminator," too.WATTERS: So what happens when they continue to barricade us into our homes? I mean, that sounds like what happened during the pandemic.CAROLLA: Well, my plan personally is to wrap myself in tin foil and stand on my Roomba vacuum cleaner and go out as their new Imperial Wizard. I'm going to be in charge of the robots. I'm going to take -- I'm just going to take foil and put it around a mop handle and anoint myself their leader, and I will then be the king of the robots.WATTERS: Okay, Adam Carolla, the self-appointed White warlord of robots. I will follow you wherever you lead. Thank you very much, Adam.CAROLLA: Thank you.WATTERS: Up next, Sage Steele on the Super Bowl everyone is talking about.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Last night, Super Bowl was a classic. Congrats to the Kansas City Chiefs for the come behind overtime thriller, but apparently America now has two national anthems.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: I had forgotten, but apparently we're singing the Black national anthem. My staff tells me we've been doing this since George Floyd and the song is called "Lift Every Voice." And apparently now, I have to learn new lyrics to the national anthem, and apparently so does everybody because at the stadium last night, people weren't even standing during the national anthem, let alone singing the Black national anthem.But I loved "America the Beautiful" because those lyrics I could remember.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: That was Post Malone who is giving Spanky Loco a run for his money on face tattoos, and when the game finally started, the 9ers offense looked unstoppable. They should have been up by at least two touchdowns after the first quarter, but penalties, turnover. No good.And the Chiefs were losing it. Kelce going nuts on the sideline.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER: After the fumble, comes over to Andy, he goes, keep me in. What happened is on the fumble, he was not in the game. Noah Gray went in and he had to block.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That was not a tantrum, he flopped Andy Reid. He is 300 pounds. That was a flop job. I'm siding with Kelce on that. I missed halftime. I was on the road, but clutch kicks. Game goes into OT, Mahomes throws the game winner, but instead of letting the moment breathe, Romo couldn't stop talking.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIM NANTZ, CBS SPORTS: First teal goal. Mahomes swings. He is there. Hardman. Jackpot, Kansas City.TONY ROMO, CBS SPORTS: And this was the Andy Reid special. This was the Andy Reid special. We talked about him saving all day, he's going to fake emotion to go across, and at that moment, he turns and goes back Hardman, who they didn't have, right? And they go get Hardman and bring him back. Game winning drive of Mahomes' career he's been waiting for this. He has never had it in an overtime. He is the best. He is the standard and Michael Jordan wins it again.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Former ESPN host, Sage Steele joins us now. Before we get into the Black national anthem, which I'm very confused by. Why does Romo talk so much?SAGE STEELE, FORMER ESPN HOST: He always has, that's the thing, Jesse, it's just -- that's the worst possible time to talk that much.Listen, I think that if you think about Tony Romo and his past and as an NFL quarterback, I mean he was so in the moment. He was so narrowly focused on what he was watching and then tried to explain it to us and his analysis is always incredible.It's just the problem with the timing. Jim Nantz had just given us the line: "Jackpot Kansas City in Las Vegas," and then Romo comes in and does that. And it's just really an unwritten rule in sports casting, is to let it read, let the video, let the scene do the talking, not your voice.And I was imagining Jim Nantz, who by the way, is the GOAT probably cringing and trying to put his hand up like stop talking. And it is unfortunate, I mean, I know Tony a little bit. I think Tony would -- Tony would love to have that moment back.WATTERS: Of course. If I were Nantz, I would have just choked him, out and it's fine because the game is over. You don't need them to talk anymore.Sage, I'm sorry --STEELE: But it is not on camera. No one would have seen that happen.WATTERS: Exactly. Exactly. I don't understand the Black national anthem. I always thought we had one national anthem for Blacks, for Whites, for Hispanics for everybody. This is new to me. It's confusing to me and these lyrics seem challenging.STEELE: The thing is, I love the song. I think many of us haven't heard the song, "Lift Every Voice and Sing" and Andra Day did a beautiful rendition of it. Your producers, from what I have researched are correct, that it didn't really start -- it was actually pre-George Floyd in the NBA about 2018 is when they started to play it in NBA games, and a few teams began to do it and a couple more.I'm wondering, though, is it just a Black History Month thing? I don't know. I think it ends up being a lot more divisive than anything else, as we're seeing right now and actually, I did a little more research, you know, that's how I roll here.Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month is in May. Let's try to do that in May for any athletes in any professional sport, right? National Hispanic Heritage Month, September through October. I mean, what about the Ukrainians and the Russians who play in the NBA? Zelenskyy and Putin will be thrilled if we play their anthems as well.Like what is the line with this? I actually think that I have the solution. Remember the Grammys last week, Tracy Chapman, Luke Combs, very diverse, an incredible song that has been talked about by the world. Let's just play "Fast Car" instead of the national anthem, certainly not the Black national -- and everybody is happy, right? It's diverse.You saw the people at the Grammys, Black rappers, White country started standing up and just standing up and cheering. Everybody will be happy if we just do "Fast Car."WATTERS: All right, big Tracy Chapman fan over here and I just can't wait for Pride Month this June because then we'll have the Gay Pride national anthem, and it's going to be fabulous. It's probably the best thing we've ever heard.Sage Steele, thank you so much.STEELE: What is that?WATTERS: If you see Tony, tell him to zip it.STEELE: I will. Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Happy National Inventors day, America.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: If you could invent something for a man named Joe Biden, what would it be?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A pill to reverse his age.BELISARIO: You like him young?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I like him confident.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Yesterday, marked National Inventors Day declared by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 to pay respect to the innovators of the world.

And --(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now American inventors, not academics built the United States into what it is today -- Eli Whitney Henry Ford, Elon Musk -- just some of the great men responsible for industrializing and modernizing human civilization, but American ingenuity is under attack and Jesse Watters has been unimpressed by the speed with which my life looks like "The Jetsons."The Google Goggles, not what I had in mind. I always envisioned flying cars, better architecture. Donald Trump has a vision that he's running on.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Our objective will be a quantum leap in the American standard of living. We should hold a contest to charter up to 10 new cities and award them to the best proposals for development.Dozens of major companies in the United States and China are racing to develop vertical takeoff and landing vehicles for families and individuals. Just as the United States led the automotive revolution of the last century, I want to ensure that America, not China leads this revolution in air mobility.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The American imagination has been dormant for too long. What do we need to do to light a fire under the next generation of thinkers?Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy knows and he joins me now.Vivek, I expected flying taxis by now. What is taking us so long?VIVEK RAMASWAMY (R), FORMER 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, we've lost that spirit of excellence in this country, Jesse, our culture of excellence. It has left oceans to lift up places like China, and their culture of Maoist victimhood is now holding us back in this country.You think back to our founding, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, these guys invented things like the Franklin stove, the lightning rod at the top of the home. Thomas Jefferson actually invented the swivel chair. He invented -- even the polygraph test was invented by Thomas Jefferson, an early prototype of it. So we need to bring back that founding spirit of curiosity that were the unafraid, the explorers. That's part of what we've lost, I think we can bring that back, but it's going to take a little bit of a generational change to do it.WATTERS: What is it about the psychology of the country that kind of keeps these creative types down and discourages that kind of out of the box thinking?RAMASWAMY: Well, if you see it, even in the classroom right now, it's not cool to be the smartest kid in the class.WATTERS: Tell me about it.RAMASWAMY: It's not cool to be the best at anything. You're supposed to -- you're supposed to hide your actual excellence. And so I think one of the things we need to start doing in this country, again, is celebrating excellence. Excellence is unifying. And I think that that's what America is founded on.We are the pioneers, the unafraid, the explorers, the people who would never be stopped. Even Christopher Columbus, who actually discovered or in many ways, at least, was among those who discovered the United States of America, we have canceled him from history.We need to celebrate people, they may be imperfect. The thing about inventors is, they're not often like the people around them. So yes, might they say some things that are a little wrong at times? Yes. But you have to celebrate what they actually achieved and that's what we need to unlock in this country again.WATTERS: So don't pick on the smart kids in school. That's a start and how was Mar-a-Lago? I saw some video you down there. Were you talking to the president about flying taxis?RAMASWAMY: You know, we had a good dinner. I don't think we got to flying taxis. We had to save something for next time. I will say one thing, we need those batteries that can actually charge themselves. That's also something I'll add to my list of inventions for our next chat.WATTERS: All right. Vivek Ramaswamy, thank you so much. Hard being the smartest kid in class. I can hear that.RAMASWAMY: Well, we need to celebrate them. So we'll do that, Jesse.WATTERS: thank you.Let's do some texts.Madison from Washington, Pennsylvania: If Biden watched PRIMETIME, he'd see the convention trap coming.Kamala watches "The Five." Stay up a little later.James from Henrico, Virginia: With Craig and Wanda each stuffing ballots, I'm seeing the start of a love story.Oh, that'd be some baby wouldn't it?Angela from Dallas, Texas: I'm a Trump gal, but RFK's ad was brilliant. Support your family.I thought the ad was excellent as well.John from Hartville, Ohio: Jesse I saw your cameo in the UberEATS Super bowl commercial.Not really sure what you're talking about there. I think you're talking about David Schwimmer. Oh, indeed.Greg from Michigan: Tony Romo is an amazing announcer. He teaches you the things about the game. You do your show and leave Romo alone.No, even I as a TV host know when it is time to shut up and that time is now. I'm Watters and this is my world.
