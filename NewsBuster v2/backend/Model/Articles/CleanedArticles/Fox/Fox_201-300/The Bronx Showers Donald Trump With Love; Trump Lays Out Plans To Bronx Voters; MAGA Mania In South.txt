Bacon has gone -- I don't eat bacon anymore, it is too expensive.When he's finished with his speech, he can never find the stairs. He can never find the stairs. When he does, it's not a pretty picture either.Thank goodness for Secret Service. They come up and they guide him off.She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk.She heard home from work that night. And soon as she arrived, she found the pretty snake she'd taken in had been revived.But instead of saying thank you, ma'am, the snake gave her a vicious bite.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: This morning supporters waited in line in the rain to hear the former president, a borough that voted 90% For Biden in 2020.

He was sued for refusing to rent his apartments to Black families and called for the execution of five innocent Black and Brown teenagers.TRUMP: And it's more than anger, it is hatred.VOICE OVER: It's why Trump stood with violent White supremacists, warned of a bloodbath if he loses the next election.

And they can't find a single thing he said that's racist.They have to go back to the 80s to find Central Park Five. Here's Trump in the 80s by the way. Black America wanted to be Trump before Black America had even heard the name Joe Biden.Politics has always been personal, personalities persuasive, but nothing persuades like results. Traditional Democrat constituencies, young, Black Hispanic voters are not better off than they were four years ago and are coming around to a man who represents a movement they were told not to trust.But every bone in their body tells them that they can't trust the party bosses. Sick of their corny commands and broken promises. People in the Bronx and all over America are beginning to think for themselves independently, outside of a system that's trapped and scolded them for opening their mouths and eyes.AOC's brain can't even grasp anything other than left, right. Watch her stammer and lie, humiliated Trump gets bigger crowds in her borough than she does.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): New York City is blue, Brooklyn is bru -- Brooklyn is blue, Queens is blue, the Bronx is blue, and he's got nowhere to go.And so he's decided to come to the South Bronx. He is broke. He needs to pay these legal funds. And, you know, busing people in in order to -- to get those donations so that he can funnel them to his legal fees is kind of his business right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Trump doesn't have to be in court for a week. He doesn't have to be in the Bronx, he wants to.Trump is not going to the Bronx because he's broke. He's going to the Bronx because the Bronx is broke. Thanks to Bidenomics and AOC.Johnny has been there since two hasn't seen a single bus pull up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Where are you from?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Bronx, actually.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Originally from the Bronx and from New York.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm from the Bronx.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right here in the Bronx, New York. This is home right here.BELISARIO: AOC says if you're not a Democrat, you don't belong here in the Bronx. What do you say?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I disagree with that.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't think she should be here in the Bronx.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I actually don't know any Democrats living in the Bronx.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, AOC, look at the tremendous support for Mr. Donald J.

Nothing's gotten any better.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let her come to the Bronx and let her come among us people that struggle. She doesn't even know what struggle is.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: All of these people want is to be heard. And when you realize that, you understand how easy a politician's job is, even easier than mine.You listen to the voters and you deliver the goods. That's it. You don't ignore them and deliver for yourself. AI would do a better job in Washington than Democrats.The Bronx has never felt more abandoned.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have so many Americans doing so bad in this country because we have people in this country believe that they have the right to strip us of our humanity, strip us of everything that we own, strip us of our rights to raise our children the way we want to raise our children.We have to stand up against them.It's not about just supporting Trump, it is supporting your rights and supporting this country tonight and supporting our children.We have you people at home are scared to come out and say you support Donald Trump? We get you. We understand that you might lose your job. But vote for him anyway.If you continue to support the Democratic Party, which is anti-Black, you're a damn fool.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The forgotten men and women of this country, the normies and blue collar Democrats who've been slighted for decades are all joining together as a part of a growing movement from the ground up.The movement reaches from the heartland to the street corner. It's everywhere, and the Bronx is just the beginning.Trump is campaigning on Biden's side of the field now.; Look for more rallies in swing state blue cities like Philly, Milwaukee, Detroit, Atlanta, Las Vegas. We're fundamentally altering the American political coalition and returning power to the people.Some would say we're saving democracy.John Garland is a lifelong Bronx resident and former Democrat. And he joins me now. John Garland, what was it like out there today?JOHN GARLAND, BRONX RESIDENT: It was exciting. It was -- the entire atmosphere was electrifying. There were people from all over the Bronx -- Black, White, Hispanic, there were Asians, there were Jews. There were like -- it was just a smorgasbord of basically patriots.WATTERS: And why was everybody there today? Was it -- they're sick of Joe Biden? They love Trump? The economy? How would you describe it?GARLAND: I would describe it as people came out here to show that they were fed up. They're fed up with systemic racism, they are fed up with being systemically excluded. And it's not just minorities, it's just -- it's about the American people. You know, and we make up a whole -- we're a whole spectrum of different people, you know?WATTERS: Was there something that Donald Trump said tonight that really hit home for everybody and you?GARLAND: Well, there wasn't anything that was in particular, that moved me. The whole thing as a whole, it was the sum of its parts. So we had -- I mean, there were people who were expressing themselves in a way like that we're fed up. People from the Bronx is fed up, people from New York is fed up and we want something different. We want change.And Donald Trump has promised to bring change and he has proven that he can do that. You know, this isn't somebody who's just stepping into the political arena as he was in 2016. Like, now he is experienced. He has -- you know, he went through what he has had to go through. The man's skin is thick as steel. So we're here for him, because he is here for us.WATTERS: So you're saying you're looking for hope and change and Donald Trump is that guy?GARLAND: Yep.WATTERS: Hope and change.GARLAND: Yes, yes.WATTERS: All right, Mr. Garland. Thanks so much for joining JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME. It sounds like there's still a party going on in the background. Go enjoy yourself, all right.GARLAND: Oh, yes. There's still people that's still coming in. There's people that -- nobody is really leaving. People are just congregating and sharing ideas and everybody is glad to be here. It was a great event.WATTERS: Well, sounds like a beautiful thing. Go have a nice early Memorial Day weekend and stay out of trouble or maybe make some trouble for me because I can't be there.GARLAND: No problem. Thank you.WATTERS: Thank you so much. Have a great night.GARLAND: You too.WATTERS: Let's go now to Alexis McAdams who is standing by in the Bronx.ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Jesse.Well, we've seen quite the crowd out here, right, in the Bronx and it is something a lot of people here weren't expecting to see. But we saw it here on the ground as those crowds just continue to grow. People from all over the Bronx, specifically in the South Bronx, as former President Donald Trump says he is going to do everything he can to turn this deep blue neighborhood as bright red as he can.So is that going to happen? We've been talking with some of those voters out here. So I'm going to bring him in right now. This is Andrew Grayton (ph), Jesse.So you said you've always voted Democrat, but this year it's going to change. Why is that?ANDREW GRAYTON, BRONX RESIDENT: Because I've seen the change go for the worse with the Bidenomics, with the Democratic Party. I've been Democrat all my life, and Donald Trump just have the right answers.He is speaking on illegal immigration, all the money pouring out of the country, people losing their jobs, the economy is failing.I am 60 years old, I realized now that we have to support Donald Trump and make things better.MCADAMS: One of the things you said earlier which I thought was interesting when I said, are you surprised there's so many people from the Black community, from the Hispanic community out here in the Bronx including Donald Trump, you said you were surprised at yourself. But you said at this point, you feel like this is what the best step is you need to take for your family is by voting for him.GRAYTON: Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, people have different reasons for being out here. But I'm not like a peer pressure type of guy. For me to be out here like this, I feel like if I'm changing my mind, then anybody can because I don't just bend in easily. I'm a hard guy to change up for --MCADAMS: All right. So it's been years, right? I mean, a hundred years since a Republican presidential candidate was able to win the Bronx.GRAYTON: Absolutely, but he is going to win it this time. Trust me. We will. I have a lot of friends. I've been here all my life. I know what's in the air, so to speak. I know the talk. Like I said, me and my son is here. And he is going to win the Bronx? Absolutely.MCADAMS: Is there anything the Democratic President Joe Biden could do at this point to gain your vote back or some of your friends votes back in the Bronx?GRAYTON: No, it's over with. I just changed my whole voter registration to Republican. It is over with.You can't change my mind. I'm not easily swayed like that. You know, I did my research, and this is what it is.MCADAMS: Okay, all right. Well, good. Well, thanks for talking to us.That is just some of what we're hearing on the ground, the different viewpoints. But the Bronx did show up for Donald Trump, so people watching across the country saw those crowds -- Jesse.WATTERS: Thanks so much, Alexis. You can definitely feel change is in the air.Up next --WATTERS: . insignificant presence in American politics. In 1977, Jimmy Carter drove through the South Bronx and called it the worst slum in America. He vowed to reshape the New York City neighborhood and restore it to its former glory, but never did.Three years later, the Bronx remain the same. And Carter's presidential campaign turned out to be nothing but a bunch of broken promises. Democrats used the people of the Bronx as pawns, and they resented it.So when Ronald Reagan visited that same Bronx neighborhood in 1980, he was not met with a warm welcome.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Surprise. Reporters were told that Reagan was on his way to make an appearance at Charlotte Street in the South Bronx.As he arrived at the very same desolate ruined block the President Carter had visited with promises to rebuild three years ago.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No riot. No nothing. Just us.RONALD REAGAN, THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Right now, right now in Congress --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What are you trying to do for us?REAGAN: I am trying to tell you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What can you?(INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION)REAGAN: I am trying to tell you what I know now, there is no program or promise that a president can make -- thank you. The federal government can then come in and wave a wand and do this.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Reagan gained their respect that day. He didn't treat the people in the Bronx as faceless votes. He spoke to them as people. Reagan went on to win almost every state in the 1980 presidential election, including New York, and he's the last Republican to do it. For now.Reagan defied all odds the day he stepped foot in the Bronx and cemented his legacy as one of the best presidents in American history.("REAGAN" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)DENNIS QUAID PORTRAYING RONALD REAGAN: Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Actor, Dennis Quaid plays Ronald Reagan and his latest film "Reagan." Group sale tickets are available and he joins us now.Dennis, how significant looking back was that Reagan visit to the Bronx.QUAID: I think very significant. I watched that during my research for "Reagan" and I also remember it because I lived through all of that era and Reagan was the first president that I voted for.And you know, he went there, it took guts to go there actually because he could have wound up with egg on his face.WATTERS: You nailed that. Do you see any similarities between 1980 and today?QUAID: I think the slogan is still: Are you better off than you were four years ago?WATTERS: Well done.QUAID: That's perfect, in fact, you know and I really admire Trump for going into the neighborhood and you know, people relate with that. They really do.And the funny thing this, all of these events that conspire against him have actually made him more human to people.WATTERS: What is it about Reagan and obviously Trump has the same personal touch, too -- it is that ability to relate to the everyday man or everyday woman in America.QUAID: Yes, and Reagan just had that going in. You know, he was always kind of a man of the people, a great communicator, as well.WATTERS: Do you see any similarities today with Donald Trump?QUAID: I think Donald Trump has been talking about cleaning house, which kind of making a clean sweep to start over. That doesn't mean being a dictator. That just means that we start doing what the American people have asked us to do.WATTERS: Dennis Quaid, thank you so much for joining JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME. "Reagan" is the name of the film. Tell us how we can see it and where we can see it?QUAID: Yes, tickets are going on sale now. This is the introduction of that, the announcement of that right here on JESSE WATTERS.The tickets are on sale in groups right now for 50 or more. So get your church group, your school group, get your boys -- excuse me, pronoun scout group to go watch this.I love you, and it's a really good movie that will remind us of how America used to be and what America can be.You know, it is a works and all presentation of Reagan. He was a great human being and I am proud of the movie.WATTERS: Good --QUAID: And Jesse, I've got to add -- we're going to have to, off air maybe talk about these Russian banya cryogenic treatments you've been down there with that cold water.WATTERS: Okay, we'll do a plunge. All right, we'll discuss this.QUAID: Yes.WATTERS: Thank you very much, Dennis. Take care of yourself.QUAID: You too, buddy.WATTERS: All right, well, how patriotic are young Americans?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Name a country you'd rather live in?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Amsterdam red light district.BELISARIO: What have they given to you that America hasn't?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Prostitutes and weed.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: 2024 is all about the swing states and right now, Trump has them locked down. The former president is up in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, just tied in Wisconsin.It is so bad for Biden, the Democrat's favorite polling wizard, Nate Silver is looking for a Plan B.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)NATE SILVER, STATISTICIAN: Democrats might be better off replacing Joe Biden on the ticket. If you were really as concerned about defeating Donald Trump as Democrats claim they are, then you should be doing everything in your power to maximize the chance that you win.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The number cruncher say if Biden doesn't get it together, it's Trump 2024.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AMY WALTER, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, COOK POLITICAL REPORT: To be losing by this margin, that is unsustainable at this point for an incumbent.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The top issues in swing states, the economy and immigration. The Trump trial isn't even moving the needle. Voters care more about the cost of groceries than closing the border.But Democrats can't campaign on any of that, because they caused it and don't offer solutions. The only political weapon they have left they think, Jan 6.A new report exposed Biden's campaign scheme: Paint top Republicans especially potential VPs as MAGA extremists. That's why they melted down when Nikki Haley who they thought was on their side said she's voting for Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: It is mind boggling that somebody who actually claims to know anything about policy would say what she just said.This is how people spread disinformation and lies and get away with it. Will you just let (bleep) keep going?SARAH LONGWELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: It shows a lack of character. It shows cowardice on her part and I'm deeply disappointed in her.WHOOPI GOLDBERG, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": She kind of does that thing when you pull in a fish and the fish is like that's trying to get somebody to --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:: Flip-flop, like a flip-flop.GOLDBERG: In a kind of funny way, yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Flip flop, flip flop, flip flop.NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST: We need shrinks and cult experts to explain this because with what you're reporting, it doesn't make a lick of sense.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: With Nicki on Trump's side, the Republican Party is fully united. Democrats are trying to drive a wedge by asking every Republican the same question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: Those are going to be the first questions I ask every single time. Do you accept the last election? Do you --(APPLAUSE)STEPHANOPOULOS: Why are you endorsing someone who refuses to accept the last election? Why are you endorsing someone who's been indicted for trying to overturn the last election?If they can't and through those questions, I'm not going to move on to tax policy and environmental policy.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)STEPHANOPOULOS: Or anything like that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Yes, let's not talk about policy at all. It's a gotcha question used to make Republicans look radical, but they're not just asking about the past. They want to lock you in on an answer for the future.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: In 2024, will you certify the election results? Do you plan to object or will you accept the results regardless of who wins the election?SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): So Kaitlan, I've got to say, I think that's actually a ridiculous question.COLLINS: It is a yes or no question.CRUZ: No, it's not. So you're asking Will you promise no matter what to agree an election as legitimate regardless of what happens? And that would be an absurd thing to claim.Like we have an entire election law system that people challenge elections, elections get overturned, voter fraud gets proven -- that happens all the time, and the media engages in this weird game post Donald Trump that you insist no voter fraud has ever existed.COLLINS: My question for you again, free and fair election, will you accept the results regardless of who wins?CRUZ: Look, if the Democrats win, I will accept the result, but I'm not going to ignore fraud.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So how can you say the election was fair if it hasn't happened yet? There's a lot that can go wrong. You don't leave a review on a restaurant six months before you eat there. You need to enjoy the food and digest it before you make your mind up. That's like saying, hey, Jesse, I loved your new book. Thanks for reading it. Oh, I didn't read it yet. I just know it's going to be good. Get it together, by the way.There is nothing illegal or radical about disputing an election. Democrats have been doing it for years.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: Either way, you never ask Hillary Clinton this. You never ask Stacey Abrams this. You never ask Al Gore this.COLLINS: With all due respect, Senator --CRUZ: Every one of them said the Republicans who won were illegitimate.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But all of a sudden, it's a Republican problem and anybody who talks to the press is going to get the gotcha question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KRISTEN WELKER, NBC NEWS: Will you accept the election results of 2024 no matter what happens, Senator?SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): No matter what happens? No, that's an unfair election, I think it's going to be contested by either side.WELKER; No matter who wins. Senator, no matter who wins.RUBIO: Well, I think you're asking the wrong person. The Democrats are the ones that have opposed every Republican victory since 2000.WELKER: Really, you accept to commit to the election results in this election cycle, no matter who wins? Just simply yes or no.SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): I expect -- I expect President Trump to win the next election. Listen, I'm not going to answer your hypothetical question.DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR AND POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Will you commit to accepting the results of this year's election?SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH): Look, Dana, I totally plan to accept the results of 2024. I think that Donald Trump will be the victory. And if it's a free and fair election, Dana, I think every Republican will enthusiastically accept the results.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Ned Ryun is the founder of American Majority and American Greatness senior fellow. Such a senior fellow you are.How would you answer the question? Ned Ryun, do you - will you accept the results of this next election? Yes or no?NED RYUN, CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: There are so many different aspects of that, Jesse.First of all, the irony, I have to say the irony of it -- if it was a crime to question election results, every Democrat would be imprisoned since they haven't accepted Republican winning the White House since 2000.I'm just sitting here, Hillary is still eight years later, not accepting 2016 and they want us to answer a hypothetical about an election that hasn't taken place.How am I supposed to accept something that hasn't yet happened? That's completely absurd. But yes, let's talk about 2024, Jesse. Let's talk about the fact that they want to see non-citizens voting in battleground states like Arizona, like in 2020, when there were over almost 12,000 people that could not prove their citizenship that got a federal ballot, that voted a margin that exceeded Biden's victory in that state.Now, they've imported 12 million new illegals. Hundred and forty-three Democrats today in the House voted in support of non-citizens voting in DC. So I ask, what do you think their plans are for the national elections? On top of that, I might have questions about a president using taxpayer dollars to turn the government into an extension of his campaign and illegally using taxpayer dollars to bribe students to vote for him.Or we could talk about the illegal drop boxes trying to come back in Wisconsin. These are just a few things. My response back to them Jesse would be until Democrats stop attempting to rig and manipulate elections and reject all of those previous things and commit to free and fair elections, I would say to them as politely as possible and to their corporate propagandists, you can get bent. I'm not endorsing your cheating.WATTERS: All right, so Trump said just moments ago in the South Bronx that it's going to be so big they can't rig.Here is just a little taste. I don't know if you saw this. There is a very prominent lifelong Democrat in the Bronx endorsing Donald.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REVEREND RUBEN DIAZ, SR., FORMER NEW YORK STATE SENATOR: Mr. President, I want to join you in having the Bronx great again.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)DIAZ: Please, accept this Democrat, this Black Puerto Rican with a kinky hair and a broken English, please accept my endorsement for you as the president.Thank you very much.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)WATTERS: So, that's Ruben Diaz, Sr. He's got a lot of juice up in that neck of the woods. Did you see this rally, Ned? This had everything.This had the snake, this had someone fainting. This had a random commencement address for, you know, young Americans that are looking to achieve success. He was loose. It was crazy.RYUN: Yep. Yep. I think they're regretting keeping him in that Manhattan courtroom. He ends up in the Bronx with twenty-five to thirty thousand people.He is earning about a billion dollars in earned media for every week this trial goes on. But I agree with you, Jesse. There needs to be a tsunami of GOP ballots in these battleground states and then I want to ask Democrats, when Donald Trump wins in 2024, will you accept the legitimacy of his win?WATTERS: I think we should just turn the tables and ask them that. That's a great idea.RYUN: Correct.WATTERS: Well, they I don't know what they even see coming because we just heard from an African American gentleman that said he's going to win the Bronx and he's changed his voter registration and all his friends and family are voting for Donald Trump.RYUN: That would be amazing.WATTERS: It's crazy. Ned Ryan, thank you so much. Senior Fellow, wear that proudly.RYUN: Thanks, Jesse. Thank you.WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday with Dr. Ben Carson.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: We will be doing this on a weekly basis, DEI is something we must have.WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday.All great nations are meritocracies. Countries and companies get stronger when the most skilled people rise to the top. Diversity is a key part of America's success. Many of our country's smartest and hardest working individuals came from diverse backgrounds.George Washington Carver was born a slave and went on to become a groundbreaking inventor and botanist.Katherine Johnson played a critical role in American space travel.And Dr. Charles R. Drew revolutionized the blood transfusion, saving countless lives.They've all left an indelible imprint on the fabric of our nation, but the problem is that the left stopped valuing hard work and technical skills and has now made DEI their number one priority. DEI might make people feel good about themselves, but emphasizing skin color over skill hurts us.While Republicans grilled Biden officials about federal DEI policies, Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett -- remember her -- twisted their concerns into an attack on diversity as a whole. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): You engaged in an exchange earlier with one of my colleagues and I don't know if you recall, but it was hitting me a little differently as a Black woman sitting here, because it almost seemed as if you either get diversity or you get qualifications.It did not seem as if my colleagues understood that someone can be diverse and qualified.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That's not what any of this is about. You can't point to a minority and claim they got the job because of DEI. Asian men and women earn more than their White counterparts in the United States. It's been that way for years, and not because of mandates and quotas, but because they have the skills to succeed and deliver results.But there are times when unqualified people are hired simply because of their race. We're now seeing the real life consequences of prioritizing diversity over skills and results.UCLA used to have a reputation as one of the country's top medical schools. But after a new dean of admissions took office in 2020, she allegedly changed their priorities to focus on underrepresented minority groups. It's been a few years since these changes took root and now we're seeing the consequences.Nearly half of the school's med students are failing basic medical exams. "The Washington Free Beacon" reporting: "Faculty members with firsthand knowledge of the admissions process says it has prioritized diversity over merit, resulting in progressively less qualified classes that are now struggling to succeed."With one admissions official saying all the normal criteria for getting into medical school only apply to people of certain races. For other people, those criteria are completely disregarded."A generation of doctors who don't know medicine. Some careers can't have a margin of error. You want a doctor to be the best. You don't want to go in for a hernia surgery and walk out with a vasectomy. Heaven forbid.These bad results in the name of DEI start at the top and they trickle down. Kamala was brought into the White House because she shatters and she still can't cut it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Netanyahu said today that there's a flooding into Gaza, and that people like Cindy McCain and the World Food Programme are misinformed when they say that there's famine and Gaza, who is correct on that?KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, I will tell you that the president and I have been very clear that more aid needs to get into Gaza, and that we have concerns and have been obviously doing work -- both please.REPORTER: Is Israel doing enough to --HARRIS: And then pickles and peppers on the side.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Pickles and peppers on the side.Joining me now, Dr. Ben Carson.Ben, I'm nervous about going in for an operation these days with the DEI situation as it is in the medical industry. I can't afford someone just dropping a pair of scissors into my abdomen. What is going on with DEI? It could be deadly.DR. BEN CARSON, FORMER HUD SECRETARY: Well, it's crazy, Jesse, and you know, our country that go from obscurity to the pinnacle of the world because of DEI and government programs. It went there because of meritocracy.You look at Lewis Latimer, the righthand man of Thomas Edison, he came up with the filament that made the light bulb work for more than two or three days. He diagrammed a telephone for Bell. He diagrammed that not only the telephone, but he invented the electric lamp.You look at Elijah McCoy who invented the automatic lubrication system for locomotive engines and he had so many great inventions people would always say "Is that a McCoy? Is that the real McCoy?"Both of those were Black guys and they didn't get there because of DEI, they got there because of merit. And we have to recognize that our system has changed. Our society has changed.When I was a kid, you know, there were a lot of people who didn't believe that Black people could do certain things and it was a widespread belief. But how many believe that now?In the same lifetime, we now have Black admirals and generals and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and heads of foundations and university presidents. We've had a president of the United States.You know, people have had an opportunity to see that people are people, and that a system of meritocracy works much better in terms of producing excellent results.And you know, as a surgeon, you know, it was kind of funny. In the beginning, there were some people who may be skeptical of me because I was Black, and then you didn't see very many Black neurosurgeons in those days, but not very many years into that. The only person they wanted was me , and that was because the results were good. And that's what we have to look at if we want to continue to provide excellence for all of our people.WATTERS: You're exactly right. It has to be results driven.I don't know if you saw what happened in the South Bronx today. It was very moving. People from all races all creeds and colors gathering their thousands of them to listen to Donald Trump. Here's just a little taste, and you can react. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: From the very first day that we take back the White House, I believe we are going to have the four grandest years in the history of our country. We're going to restore peace through strength. We're going to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.We're going to protect our great seniors and I will never let anyone touch your Medicare or your Social Security. Under the Democrat program, they will be gone.We are going to restore free speech in America. We are going to fight for your right to school choice, something you all want. And I would not allow schools to impose COVID vaccine mandates or masks anywhere.We are going to get far left Marxist lunacy out of our children's classrooms. We're going to keep men out of women's sports.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Keeping men out of women's sports, getting rid of CRT --CARSON: Yes.WATTERS: Supporting free speech. I mean, the crowd went wild, Dr. Carson.CARSON: It's so refreshing to see that just because Trump believes and WANE. W-A-N-E. We are not enemies. And he believes in what our founders believed in, the common good. That was a phrase you saw all the time.It's not what's good for this group or this group. But what It's good for all of us and to see somebody who's going to be our next president bringing that back it's very refreshing we have a lot of rehabilitating to do, but I think we're on the way and I'm glad to see a crowd like that react the way that they did.WATTERS: I sure am, too. Dr. Carson, you can operate on me anytime. Thank you very much.Johnny hits the streets.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: It is almost Memorial Day weekend. How patriotic our young Americans.
