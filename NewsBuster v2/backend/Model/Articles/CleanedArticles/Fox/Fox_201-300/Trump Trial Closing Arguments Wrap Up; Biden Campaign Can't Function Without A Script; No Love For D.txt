JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Thank you for bearing with us tonight. Remember to check out "Vietnam: Footsteps of My Father" which is available right now on Fox Nation. It's great folks. I've seen it.That's it for us tonight. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro, in for Laura. Thanks for watching.Jesse Watters takes it from here.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --ROBERT DE NIRO, ACTOR: Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city, but the country, and eventually he could destroy the world.WATTERS: Closing arguments in the trial of the century.DE NIRO: You are gangsters.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're washed up.DE NIRO: (Bleep) you.JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Why these young people aren't coming home to the Democrats? Because Democratic messaging is full of (bleep).And talk about cost of living.WATTERS: The Biden campaign is blowing it.CARVILLE: Stop it. (Bleep), stop it. The poll numbers are not good. You're old.PETE BUTTIGIEG, US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: The effects of climate change are already upon us in terms of our transportation. Indications that turbulence is up by about 15 percent.WATTERS: They're blaming turbulence on global warming.("THE NAKED GUN" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)FRANK DREBIN, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: Calm down. Get a hold of yourself.WATTERS: Plus --JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Who did America fight in the Revolutionary War?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Africa.WATTERS: Fox News Alert: Closing arguments just wrapping up in President Trump's trial and if he comes out and talks to the cameras, we will bring those comments to you.There's an old cliche in criminal psychology: The criminal always returns to the scene of the crime and after telling us repeatedly they had nothing to do with prosecuting their rival, the Biden campaign this morning returned to an active crime scene: The subzero Manhattan courthouse where Democrats have been pinning Trump down with a political ankle monitor.The criminal brought with him his co-conspirators, old men in Black.Punchy Bobby De Niro wearing a mask, still trying to slow the spread of populism and the two Capitol Police officers who played starring roles in the January 6th hearing, they have book deals, CNN gigs, and even ran for Congress.Usually, when criminals return to a crime scene, they do it for the sick thrill. But the Biden campaign just came to confess.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL TYLER, BIDEN CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN: We are not here today because of what's going on over there. We're here today because you all are here.We're here primarily because of the threat that Donald Trump poses to the United States of America and to our democracy.The contrast here pretty much writes itself. As we speak, Donald Trump is somewhere fighting for himself maybe taking a power nap.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That's the Biden campaign spokesman admitting the trial is about the Democrats stopping Trump.After a year of insisting that Biden had nothing to do with prosecuting Trump, the Biden campaign holds a press conference at the steps of the courthouse where Trump is being prosecuted. Why? Because they say they had to go where the press was to get their word out.What are they talking about? The press stands outside the Oval Office every day. They follow Biden on Air Force One wherever he goes.He had to go looking for them in Lower Manhattan where it just so happens Trump is on trial? You can't campaign outside of a courthouse that your party is prosecuting your opponent in. The most powerful man in the world sent an actor who plays a mob boss to intimidate the jury before deliberations. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DE NIRO: The Twin Towers fell just over here, just over there. This part of the city was like a ghost town. But we vowed, we would not allow terrorists to change our way of life.Donald Trump --UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Bleep) Joe Biden.DE NIRO: -- wants to destroy not only the city --UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Bleep) Joe Biden.DE NIRO -- but the country --UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Bleep) Joe Biden.DE NIRO: -- and eventually he could destroy the world.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Bleep) Joe Biden.DE NIRO: Under Trump, this kind of government will perish from the earth.I don't mean to scare you. No, no, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you. If he gets in. I can tell you right now, he will never leave. He will never leave.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden made an actor read a script in Lower Manhattan saying his opponent is worse than 9/11. And then the actor slipped and went off script and admitted he's trying to scare you.In politics, you can't admit you're trying to scare voters. It's not the movies. But watch what happens when there is no script.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: What's your response to Republicans who say you're running on January 6th because you can't run on Biden's record?TYLER: I'd say that's absolutely absurd.REPORTER: Do you consider Trump a threat to all these wars Biden has gotten us into?TYLER: Any media questions?REPORTER: Is this a weaponization of the Justice Department, sir?TYLER: Any media questions?REPORTER: You won't answer the real questions, only the fake news?(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That's what happens when Team Biden can't pre-select questions from toadies. Got even more embarrassing when a carjacker set off an alarm, the kind of crime Bragg doesn't prosecute and it drowned out De Niro .(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DE NIRO: These guys are the true heroes. They stood and put their lives on the line for these low lives, for Trump.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They lied under oath.DE NIRO: They lied under oath.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's right.DE NIRO: Who lied under oath? What are you telling me?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those two traitors behind you.DE NIRO: Excuse me?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those two traitors behind you.DE NIRO: They lied under oath?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's right.DE NIRO: What are you saying?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're traitors.DE NIRO: They're traitors? I don't know -- I don't even how to deal with you, my friend. I don't even know how to deal with you.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: DE NIRO thought it was just going to be like one of those movie red carpet premieres where everybody kisses up. But at the slightest challenge, the man couldn't keep his emotions in check.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Bleep) you. (Bleep) you.DE NIRO: You are gangsters. You are gangsters.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're washed upDE NIRO: (Bleep) you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're a little punk. You're a softie. You're a nobody. Your movies suck. Your trash. Your trash. You're done.You're done after this, my guy.You're a (bleep) mook. M-O-O-K. Mook.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: New Yorkers see it for what it is, a political prosecution. It is what the Trump team has been saying all along.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, JR., DONALD TRUMP'S SON: But the fact that they're holding a rally across the seat from this very witch hunt, right across the street tells us exactly what we all knew all along, that it is a political persecution.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Biden folks have finally done it after months of seeing the politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a Lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump, and the best that Biden can do is roll out a washed up actor.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The Rock, Patrick Mahomes, Cardi B -- lots of celebrities who endorsed Biden last time refusing to run it back, so they recycle Punchy Bobby.Behind-the-scenes, POLITICO reports that Biden is hoping to seize on the Trump verdict by making an address to the nation from the White House and on the campaign trail will begin calling Trump a convicted felon. It's almost like they know the outcome.Biden's political strategy is identical to Bragg's legal strategy. Both men campaigned on stopping Trump. And both are now doing it in court, inside the courthouse and outside, and they are both using the same actors, porn stars, and despicable lawyers.Fox News legal editor, Kerri Urbahn is here.So you were in the courthouse. You were outside where the action was. Do you, as a witness to that think that they pulled it off?KERRI KUPEC URBAHN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL LEGAL EDITOR: So, here is what it was like. We were sitting there, the energy was, I think higher than it normally is. You know, we're sitting in the media bullpen. We're looking across the street at all of these Trump supporters, they're in a good mood. They start blasting music, the police tell them to stop, but you know, generally happy, upbeat.And then suddenly, we got a notification in our e-mail. The Biden campaign is one, going to have a press conference, but two, there is a special guest.WATTERS: Oh.URBAHN: Right. So now we're thinking, oh, who's the special guest? I thought maybe E. Jean Carroll, Michael Cohen. You know, it's been a convention of characters down there.WATTERS: Right.URBAHN: And then Robert De Niro --WATTERS: Punchy Bobby.URBAHN: -- walks onto the sidewalk. And I'll tell you what, he started off on a pretty, let's say frustrating note to the Trump supporters across the street because he immediately turned to all of the people who had been supporting Trump and are just kind of happily going along and saying they're crazy. This supports crazy. Trump should stop them from doing that. He should stop people from supporting him.WATTERS: Okay.URBAHN: And so they all flock to the podium, and then everything you saw after that is what happened.WATTERS: So we had some Let's Go Brandon chants in there.URBAHN: Right.WATTERS: You had a car alarm.URBAHN: Yes.WATTERS: You had some questions, which I don't think the Biden spokesperson was ready for. It doesn't look like they planned this very well, to send Robert De Niro, I don't know how old he is, but he is a hot mess.URBAHN: He is 80.WATTERS: He has Trump derangement syndrome, into the belly of the beast. Why do you think the Biden campaign thought that was a good idea after spending the whole year distancing themselves politically from the trial?URBAHN: Because they were desperate. Because Biden had a bad news cycle in the last few days. Some bad headlines from POLITICO saying that Democrats are in full freakout mode. So what I was thinking if I am a comms person on that campaign team, what you want to do is figure out what is the shiny object we can dangle over here that everyone will go running to towards.And I mean, think about it. You and I are talking about this right now.WATTERS: They dangled De Niro.URBAHN: And so, but here is the thing, I think it ended up backfiring because he is calling people crazy as he is coming off as unhinged and then they all flocked to the back of his press conference because now they're very angry that he called them crazy at the very beginning and they're screaming the entire time, which completely defeated the purpose of what he was doing.WATTERS: So big day tomorrow. We will get jury instructions, you believe.URBAHN: Yes.WATTERS: And then any day now?URBAHN: Yes, so the judge said that jury instructions will take about an hour. And then it depends on how long the jury decides to deliberate.Now, if I'm the jury, though, at this point, I want to be done with this. The fact that the prosecution dragged this out until eight o'clock tonight, they've got to be thinking, get me out of here.WATTERS: Because they've had how long off? They've had six days, plus a Memorial Day.URBAHN: Right.WATTERS: So they're a little woozy, like some of us.URBAHN: And also, it's been hanging over their head. They probably want to get back to their normal lives at this point, instead of listening for the hundredth time what Michael Cohen lied about three years ago.WATTERS: So you're predicting, Kerri Urbahn, we could get a verdict tomorrow.URBAHN: I would like to think we are. I don't know that that's going to happen. It depends on how long it takes the jury deliberates.WATTERS: So Thursday?URBAHN: We will see. We will see.WATTERS: All right, we will see. Thank you so much, Kerri.URBAHN: Thank you.WATTERS: So closing arguments are done and we still don't know what the crime of the trial of the century is. Even CNN says Bragg fell short.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: You think after listening to all of this, you think they fell short? How?RANDY ZELIN, DEFENSE ATTORNEY, FORMER PROSECUTOR: They fell way short, because let's start with reasonable doubt. There is reasonable doubt all over this case. Where is Keith Schiller? Where is Alan Weisselberg?How did Michael Cohen get away with stealing $30,000.00? Hold a pity party for him? Made $4 million on this, thought he'd be chief-of-staff. He's a fixer.Stormy Daniels, let's hold a pity party for her. It's everywhere.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Trump legal spokesperson, Alina Habba joins me now.Alina, So you were there. Closing arguments, Todd Blanche, Trump's defense counsel went first and gets the prosecution. What -- did five hours?ALINA HABBA, DONALD TRUMP ATTORNEY: Right. That's what you have to do when you haven't proven your case in trial. You plan that you have this great big break and then you come up and you say, oh, guess what? I get to go do an argument and in my entire argument, guess what, everybody? They don't get to rebut anything I say.So they took four hours to tell their story. I actually had to leave. I couldn't believe it. I mean, it was insane. It was --WATTERS: We all need a bathroom break. Very, very long closer.HABBA: Yes, but --WATTERS: What was the point? Did they have a crime at the end of this?HABBA: No.WATTERS: No. Still, they haven't named the crime.HABBA: They could not give us any evidence. It was a lot of noise. And that's what we keep seeing, Jesse. There was not one bit of evidence that showed that Donald Trump had an intent to commit any crime. And I'm still, as I sit here, as an attorney, trying to understand how they could have possibly brought this, at this point, wasted this much taxpayer dollars, past the statute of limitations, and then had the audacity to make a jury sit there until eight o'clock with a bunch of nonsense and shiny balls, as she just said, because that's all they've got. They've got no facts.WATTERS: So we're hearing from inside the court and you can confirm this, every time defense raised an objection, overruled.HABBA: Overruled.WATTERS: Judge overrules every objection from the defense and sustains every objection from the prosecution.HABBA: I can't relate to that at all. It's unbelievable. I mean, you've seen it and the way that the visceral reaction that this judge had, when we had our one witness come up, and he threw the press out. That kind of anger. That kind of TDS. Frankly, we saw it with De Niro today.But that is what we're challenged with. We're dealing with people that are either going to believe a story. It was like sitting in Make Believe Land with the prosecution today, or you're going to listen to the facts. And the facts took us an hour and a half to break down. There were none.And you've got a person that is a complete liar that you're relying on. It was pretty simple for us. It took them a very long time to try and bob, weave, and make up stories.WATTERS: You were there in the courtroom for almost every single day. You laid your eyes on the jury.HABBA: Yes.WATTERS: They're going to start deliberating tomorrow. I know we don't like to make predictions about this. You saw them absorb the closer this evening. Are we going to get a result Wednesday? Thursday? Friday? What are you feeling?HABBA: I don't feel like, first of all, we can call it a closer when it was five hours. It was more of a long movie that wouldn't end.WATTERS: Right.HABBA: But no, I think that honestly, if they do the right thing, and considering that we're in New York, I think we should get a hung jury. But like any hung jury, the judge is going to give them an Allen charge. He's going to tell you to go back, re-study everything. You're the jury that can do this.So maybe three days max. I mean, I'd hope so.It, to me it should be an acquittal, but I'm not a New York liberal person sitting --WATTERS: Right. Right. Thank God, you're not.HABBA: Yes.WATTERS: All right, well, maybe by the end of the week, we could get some sort of verdict. Thank you so much, Alina Habba.HABBA: Thank you.WATTERS: Oh, the Bragg trial isn't the only one Biden is tampering with. After shopping for shirts at Joseph A. Bank, for a reason we can't figure out since the president of the United States has a personal shopper and tailor who suits him at the White House, he ditched the traveling press pool and paid a surprise visit to the star witness of his son's gun trial.Biden disappeared without warning and left the media waiting in the dark in a parking garage while he paid Hailey Biden a house call.Hailey Biden, his son, Beau's widow, had a drug-fueled affair with his other son, Hunter. Hailey tossed Hunter's illegal gun in the trash by the school that Hunter blamed on Mexicans and she'll be the star witness in Hunter's felony gun trial in Delaware next month where the prosecution will ask her to corroborate Hunter's drug use while purchasing the pistol.The prosecution plans to enter into evidence videos of Hunter doing drugs and incriminating and embarrassing text messages between Hunter and Hailey.Joe Biden shouldn't be anywhere near Hailey Biden on the eve of his son's trial. Just the appearance of being alone in the room with the prosecution's star witness a week before jury selection could be seen as witness tampering.What do you think Joe Biden was telling the witness? And why didn't Hailey who's technically still his daughter-in-law, not visit him at his house?Ditching the press and sneaking into her house after dark? One on one? The most powerful man in the world? That's a problem. But the White House has a cover story.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Why did President Biden have a private meeting with a witness who plans to testify in court against his son?President Biden was at her house this week.KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think the American people should also be told the full breadth of this.He visits her days before the anniversary of the passing of his son and she is family. She was married, obviously to his late son. And I think that is something also to mention, as you're asking your question to me.DOOCY: So they did not talk about her testimony.JEAN-PIERRE: This was not about that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But we couldn't find any evidence of Biden ever visiting Hailey at her home. And we've never seen Haley at the White House. Not at the July 4th barbecues, not at the Easter Egg Rolls, never. And how does Binder know they didn't talk about her testimony? She wasn't there.And that's the point. No one was.It is like when Bill Clinton talked to Loretta Lynch alone on the tarmac while she was investigating Hillary's e-mails. I'm sure Biden just talked about their grandkids, too.Former White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany joins me now. So Kayleigh, on the heels of Biden sending his campaign to the steps of the courthouse where his party is prosecuting his rival, he is going over and talking alone in the dark to the star witness of his son's felony gun trial. He thinks he can get away with that?KAYLEIGH MCENANY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CO-HOST: Hey, Jesse. Yes. The optics are very poor.Peter Doocy, spot on to ask the question. I think, you know, in this case, yes, it is three days before the passing of his son, Beau Biden, the ninth anniversary. So you know, I understand that. I will give them the benefit of the doubt on that.But I think you make an interesting point, Jesse. Really poor optics visiting the star witness. You send your campaign to your rival's trial after apparently according to POLITICO, Joe Biden sent down an edict, and he said White House, campaign, stay away from the Trump trial and then all of a sudden it happens.And Jesse, I go back to a "New York Times" article from April of last year, it was Katie Rogers in "The New York Times." She literally wrote in the pages of "The New York Times" that Joe Biden was telling those around him, according to two people familiar that he wanted to see Donald Trump prosecuted for January 6th, and he was tired of Merrick Garland, his attorney general acting like a ponderous judge, and wanted him to take decisive action.So this notion that Joe Biden has nothing to do with DOJ, he's far away. Never mind my top three DOJ guys prosecuting a state level case. There's a lot more to this story. And if reporters dug, dug deep, what would we find?WATTERS: Well, they need to dig because the CIA, according to the whistleblowers have already told prosecutors to back off interviewing the sugar brother. He's untouchable, said the CIA.MCENANY: Yes.WATTERS: Now why is the sugar brother to Hunter untouchable? Is he an asset? Where'd the money come from that he was giving to Hunter for the last couple of years? Is that money considered a campaign contribution?But Kayleigh, go back for a second. If you're the president of the United States, you know, your son's on trial. Jury selection begins next week. How about a phone call to Hailey to commemorate Beau?MCENANY: Yes.WATTERS: Just so you don't look like you're tampering. Instead he goes to her house, ditches the press, that is -- that takes you some you know what.MCENANY: Yes, it is poor, poor decision-making; very bad optics. While your rival is on trial as you deploy your campaign to the scene, I think you know the Trump campaign should do the reverse.Send the Trump campaign to the Hunter Biden trial, show the American people the disparity there. Do you think there are going to be reporters teaming around the Hunter Biden trial? Of course there won't be.Send the Trump campaign. Let's show the American people. There's another person you should be looking at, another person who needs to be asked questions.WATTERS: All right, I think Jason Miller just booked his flights to Delaware for next week.MCENANY: He should.WATTERS: Kayleigh, thank you so much. Not a bad idea.MCENANY: Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Happy Memorial Day.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Who did America fight in the Revolutionary War?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right. That might have gotten me there.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: The election is five months off and over the weekend, Biden ditched the press in a dark Delaware parking lot and appeared to fall asleep during an event on Memorial Day, resting his eyes for a prolonged period of time. I'm sure he was just meditating.Today Biden stormed back onto the campaign trail. Kidding. He had no events. Over the weekend, Trump was in a race in North Carolina.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(PEOPLE cheering.)(PEOPLE chanting "USA.")(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: If you're a man of the people, and if you're a man, you can't hide from those who disagree. Trump showed up to the libertarian convention in DC, too. But the welcome wasn't as warm as the track.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm committing to tonight that I will put a libertarian in my Cabinet and also libertarians in senior posts.(BOOING)TRUMP: Maybe you don't want to win. Keep getting your three percent every four years.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: You risk disagreements when you leave your bubble, but that's what campaigning for president is about. You want to be president for all Americans, and you're willing to listen to everyone. It's a reason why Trump is beating Biden.The latest national poll has Trump up two, and the Democrats are wetting the bed.This from POLITICO: Dems in full blown freakout over Biden. Why? The economy, stupid. Biden's favorability hasn't budged since the State of the Union because he won't own the pain his policies caused.The Ragin' Cajun says Democrats have lost the plot.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARVILLE: We keep wondering why these young people aren't coming home to the Democrats? Why Blacks are not coming home to the Democrats? Because Democratic messaging is full of (bleep). That's why.And talk about cost of living and we're going to help deal with this. And don't talk about (bleep) Gaza and student loans.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Carville is just saying out loud what other Democrats are whispering behind closed doors. "The Wall Street Journal" says Democrats are frustrated that Joe Biden, the empathizer-in-chief is completely unable to empathize, "President Biden is facing calls from anxious Democrats to express more empathy over inflation and prices as voters continue to reject the president's positive rhetoric on the economy. Biden has heard from Democratic members of Congress who have urged him to express more compassion on the economy."This is how Joe shows economic compassion these days, lying and telling you to pay up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No president has had the run we've had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation. It was nine percent when I came to office.ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR: But there's real pain. I mean, grocery prices are up 30 percent, more than 30 percent since the beginning of the pandemic, and people are spending more on food and groceries than they have at any time, really in the past 30 years. I mean, that's a real day-to-day pain that people --BIDEN: No, it really is and it's real. But the fact is that if you take a look at what people have, they have the money to spend.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Joe Biden was never a talented politician. His whole career has been simple mindedness, out of touch. He was told he has compassion. I've never seen it. I think the media manufactured it.And as you know, what the media giveth, the media taketh away. Maybe that's why more than half of likely Democratic voters say they want a presidential switcheroo by the convention.Valuetainment founder, Patrick Bet-David joins us now.The old switcheroo. You feeling that theory?PATRICK BET-DAVID, FOUNDER, VALUETAINMENT: You know, first of all, Happy Memorial Day to all the servicemen around the country, but I'm going to tell you this.Listen, in business and in life, it comes down to four things: Whoever out works, out improves, out strategizes, and outlasts wins. Let's take a look at this between Biden and Trump.Trump out working. He gets one day a week to campaign, Wednesdays. His opponent has seven days, right? One out of seven, that's like a quarterback that gets 70 attempts. Joe Biden, a quarterback only gets 10 attempts. The guy would throw in 10 attempts, gets 10 touchdowns the other guy cannot get a single touchdown.So he got outworked. He's out improving because if you notice 2020, President Trump seemed a little bit upset. His campaign was it's not fair. It's not fair. It's not fair.2024, it is optimism. Unification. Greatest country in the world. We've got to make a comeback. Messaging has improved. Uplifting. You want to be around the guy.He seems optimistic even though they're doing all the stuff to him. Out worked, out improved, out strategized. This guy has got the audacity to go to New York in AOC's county, campaign and shake hands with people five, ten, fifteen, twenty-five thousand people show up.You're willing to tell me you have the audacity to come to my city, New York? Even though the campaign manager for Biden today that showed up, I don't know if you saw him or not, very famous campaign manager Vito Corleone showed up today. And he had to analyze this to see if he can kind of change it up, aka Robert De Niro.And last but not least, outlast, it is his biggest strength. Good luck outlasting him when it comes to campaigning. There's no way President Biden can do that.WATTERS: You're right. He's out hustling. I'm in all four of those factors. But Joe's got the establishment. He's got the CIA telling the prosecutors to back off his son's sugar brother. He's got Alvin Bragg doing his dirty work. He's got Jack Smith. He's got Letitia James and Fani and the crew down in Atlanta.And he's got the media who Joe can't do anything wrong. He can lie, and they say it's fine. You can fall asleep at a Memorial Day event and they say, oh, no, that's fake news. Is that going to be enough to help him go across the finish line again?BET-DAVID: I think he's going to need manipulation and gamesmanship and trying to find a different way to win because when you look at the polls right now, couple embarrassing polls for Biden.New York in 2020, you win by 23 points. 61 to 38. Right now, New York, he has only got a nine-point lead. This is Siena poll, by the way.You look at blacks voting in 2020, they won. Twenty-two percent, a nine percent is what Trump got with the Black votes; 91 percent pretty much went to the other side.Trump has got 22 percent now and climbing. He is winning the business owners. He is winning the workers. He is winning the Black vote. He is winning the young vote. He's winning the people in the middle libertarian vote.You go to their convention, it starts off booing. You don't give up and it ends with cheering. I mean, this is how you go into these types of moments to be able to win. He's doing it.The only thing -- the only thing I always say, stay paranoid. You want him to run. You want Biden to be the candidate. You don't want him to bring anybody else, but only the paranoid survive. They're not going to lose this easily.WATTERS: Only the paranoid survive. I haven't heard that one, but that's a good one. I'll have to write that down. And remember, Biden is only up nine in New York and guess who just qualified to get on the ballot? RFK, Jr. here in New York. It is going to play a major factor.Pat Bet-David, thanks as always for joining JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.More PRIMETIME ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Biden's entire campaign is built on fear. He doesn't try to persuade, he scares. Vote for Biden or Trump will become a dictator. There's going to be World War Three and global warming will boil the oceans. But when it comes to Biden, don't listen to what he says, watch what he does.In 2021, Biden spent over seven billion bucks on electric car charging stations. He told us he'd put half a million plugs in all over the country. Three years later, he's built eight -- eight.It's such a scam even the legacy media is on to it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: The Federal Highway Administration says only seven or eight charging stations have been produced with the seven-and-a- half billion investment that taxpayers made back in 2021. Why isn't that happening more quickly?BUTTIGIEG: So the president's goal is to have half a million chargers up by the end of this decade. Now in order to do a charger, it is more than just plugging a small device into the ground. There's utility work and this is also really a new category of federal investment.But we've been working with each of the 50 states. Every one of them is getting formula dollars to do this work engaging --BRENNAN: Seven or eight though?Buttigieg --- them and the first handful -- again by 2030, five hundred thousand chargers, and the very first handful of chargers are now already being physically built.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: If global warming is such an imminent threat, wouldn't we be mass producing charging stations around the clock? At this rate, it'll take them a hundred years to meet Biden's goal of 500,000 plugs. A hundred years.Last year in New York, the mayor celebrated when they opened one charging station. We sent Johnny and it turned out it wasn't even open yet.Today, we sent a producer back to the garage for a welfare check. Two chargers out of order, and most of the others weren't even being used. We asked people in the neighborhood if they're excited about their new charging station.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRODUCER: Do you drive an electric car?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do not. No.PRODUCER: What's stopping you from buying one?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Probably not having the need for a car.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't have a car right now here because the parking problems.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The charge time and going on road trips makes it a little bit more difficult.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's going to add a lot more time to my trip if I have to be in line for two hours to just charge my car for an hour to just get somewhere.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The city in general has enough cars.PRODUCER: Did you know about this charging station?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I live not too far from it. I have no idea about a charging station.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: He's not alone. No one that we spoke to had any idea that this little charging station even existed.EVs are expensive. I saw a ton of them in California over the weekend, but there's not many on the road and the rest of the country. It's hard to believe these people when they blame everything on global warming -- migration, racism, disease. It's all the climates fault.This week, they added turbulence to the list.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BUTTIGIEG: The effects of climate change are already upon us in terms of our transportation. We've seen that in the form of everything from heat waves that shouldn't statistically even be possible, threatening to melt the cables of transit systems in the Pacific Northwest to hurricane seasons becoming more and more extreme and indications that turbulence is up by about 15 percent.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Michael Shellenberger is a Substack columnist.Michael, have you seen any evidence linking global warming to turbulence?MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER, AUTHOR, "APOCALYPSE NEVER": Good to be with you, Jesse.I mean, there's a single study that everybody is now citing, the media are all now writing stories about, I think, because Pete Buttigieg mentioned it, but there was a revision to that study, they found it's not statistically significant. It was a model.And look, the bigger point is that like, first of all, the one guy who they said died from turbulence, he had a heart attack, so we can't really attribute it -- I think he hit his head when I first heard about it. And there's been no other deaths since 2009 from turbulence.So I mean, this is junk science. I mean, you know, it's just absurd. The idea that turbulence is this major threat to human life just shows how crazy the debate has become.WATTERS: Michael, what about the fact that now the mainstream media is giving Pete a little jazz about these EVs? I mean, seven billion and they have eight, Mike, eight? Why isn't it like Operation Warp Speed? If we're all going to die in 10 years, get these things plugged in and going?SHELLENBERGER: Well, yes, that and the other funny part of it, of course, is that yes, now they're going to do 100,000 per year between 2025 and 2030. I mean, that was the implication of that. Definitely, that's not going to happen.You know, we didn't subsidize our way to having an electric grid or to having gas stations. That was not something that the government did. That was something that was done by the private sector. There's some amount of investment in R&D that I support. But this idea that some other government should be responsible for building a half a million refueling stations or electric recharging stations. I think it's obviously an overreach and we need to -- we need to have a more sensible energy policy.WATTERS: I think in a couple of years, we're going to walk around and look at these EV charging stations like we look at like payphones today. I tell my son I'm like that's a payphone, okay, we used to put a quarter in there and we just stopped building them.Mike Shellenberger, thanks as always.Go check out his Substack, always a good read.Johnny hits the beach.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Who did America fight in World War Two?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Russia.BELISARIO: Not Russia.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Memorial Day was Monday where we honor those who lost their lives serving our country, but it seems like squad members, Omar and Bush don't know what the holiday means.Looks like they thought it was Veterans Day.
