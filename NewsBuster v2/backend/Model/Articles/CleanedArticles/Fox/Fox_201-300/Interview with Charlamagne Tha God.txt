LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS HOST: Charlamagne Tha God bringing "The Breakfast Club" to FOX & FRIENDS talking to Biden's unsurprise - I'm sorry, uninspiring message to the black community and Trump's legal challenges.BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST: He says this November is a choice between crooks and cowards and the couch.Watch.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)KILMEADE: People are always talking politics with you. You talk politics on your show. You said you'd rather talk about issues than politicians.CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD, HOST, "THE BREAKFAST CLUB": Yes.KILMEADE: And you do not like your choices right now for this presidential race.CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: I mean you look at the polls in America. Most of America doesn't like our choices in this presidential race. I think that this election this year is about the Republicans, who are the crooks, the Democrats, who are the cowards because they don't fight for nothing, and the couch, which is voter apathy. And I think the couch will probably - will probably win. And whose fault is that? It's not the people, it's the candidates.KILMEADE: Why do you think Republicans are the crooks?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: I mean, damn, the candidate for president has 88-plus criminal charges right now.KILMEADE: How many do you think are legitimate?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: I have no idea. But I do know that if Barack Obama had 88 criminal charges, it wouldn't be a question of how many are legitimate, it would be, he's not qualified to run.KILMEADE: From what you know about the case in New York, do you think that would be brought by any other candidate - any other person that you know?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: It just looks weird for that to be the first one that rolls out. Like, you know, if it was something about, you know, election interference, that would make more sense to me. It does look like a show. And it's going to be bad if, you know, that one gets thrown out because everybody is going to automatically just say, well, all the rest of them might be BS, too.KILMEADE: I've not seen an African-American poll with Trump less than 20 percent.CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: Uh-huh.KILMEADE: Why do you think he's picking up Hispanic, black, or minority support?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: I don't know if he really is. And the reason I say that, I think a lot of those polls might be slightly overstated. I do think it will be an uptick. I don't know - I can't see 20 percent of, you know, black people voting for Donald Trump.KILMEADE: A hundred thousand people lined up in Wildwood, New Jersey, to watch a guy in a state that he lost by 15 points.CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: Uh-huh.KILMEADE: You can't say that they're not energized to see Trump.CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: He's entertaining. So, they like - they like going for -KILMEADE: Do you think it's that?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: They like going to a free standup show. I'm not saying that these guys don't have a base. But as far as like those hypothetical swing voters, you know, the youth vote, the people who are just, you know, turning 18 who want to go out there and vote, they're not inspired by either one of these candidates.KILMEADE: I watched a couple of weeks ago when the president of the United States went to Morehouse College, an all-black - historically black college.JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What is democracy if black men are being killed on the street? What is democracy if the trail of broken promises still leave black communities behind?Most of all, what does it mean? As we've heard before, to be a black man who loves his country, even if it doesn't love him back in equally measure.KILMEADE: If you were sitting in that audience wearing that gown graduating that day, is that an inspirational message?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: No. Not - not in no way, shape, or form, especially for somebody who's been in politics as long as, you know, President Biden had been in politics. Like, I would be wondering, like, well, what have you done?Look, I don't want to hear about the problems, I want to hear from you the solutions.KILMEADE: What is the message you think that - that seniors in college need to hear?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: If I was President Joe Biden and, you know, I was getting the backlash that I was getting from Morehouse students, I would have talked with them, not to them. I want to have a conversation with them. And I want to see what they're really frustrated about. I think that would go way farther than what he did.And these kids are brilliant. Like, these kids, you know, they - they care about actual issues. A lot of them were talking about RFK Jr. And the reason they were talking about RFK Jr. was because he came to the school and spoke to them. So, he had a conversation with them. And they believed a lot of the things that were, you know, coming out of his mouth. That's what President Biden should be doing. That's what the vice president, Kamala Harris, should be doing.I - I've said it a million times, Vice President Kamala Harris should be coming on Fox. Like, they - they're - they're afraid of Fox, right? My whole thing is, go to Fox, have conversations with, you know, the personalities on Fox and talk to the Fox audience. Very hard to misconstrue, you know, what somebody is saying when you're actually watching them say it.KILMEADE: Understood, too, because you knew Kamala Harris when - before she was the vice president.CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: Yes.KILMEADE: And you - and you had great hope for her. And that was one of the reasons you supported the Biden-Harris ticket last time. And - and you -CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: That - she - she was the reason.KILMEADE: She was the reason?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: Yes.KILMEADE: And what happened?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: I think that, you know, she's handcuffed a lot by this administration. And it's interesting because they -KILMEADE: Why do you think that?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: Why do I think she's -KILMEADE: Why do you think she's handcuffed?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: Because I know her. And I know what she stands for. And I know, you know, the things that - that she wants to do that she may not necessarily, you know, be in a position to do because she doesn't want to overstep the president.KILMEADE: Do you think she would be a good president?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: She wouldn't be any different than any other Democrat. Like, what - what - what policies, you know, what issues would she be so different on than President Obama was, you know, or President Biden? She wouldn't be any different than any other Democrat. That's why when I hear people say things like, we should be terrified of a Kamala Harris presidency. We should be scared of a Kamala Harris presidency. Why?KILMEADE: Right.CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: You know why, because she's a woman of color.KILMEADE: Oh, I don't think so.CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: Oh, 100 percent.KILMEADE: Do you - do you think that Nikki Haley didn't get the nomination because she's a minority?CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: I think Nikki Haley probably didn't get the nomination because she was afraid to stand up to Donald - to Donald Trump.KILMEADE: Oh, she stood I to him. She was -CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: Not until the end.When it comes to Nikki Haley, I said, you know, months - months ago that I felt like the GOP was doing themselves a disservice by not making her the nominee because I think people want something different so bad -KILMEADE: Right.CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: Right now in this moment that she probably could have ended up getting votes, you know, from - from - from both sides.(END VIDEOTAPE)KILMEADE: He also went on to say, he doesn't think that America would elect a woman president. I go absolutely - I think he's totally wrong on that. But everyone's entitled to their opinion. I think we'd elect a woman president, black, white. I think it's - it's the best candidate.AINSLEY EARHARDT, FOX NEWS HOST: It's the right person.KILMEADE: Yes.STEVE DOOCY, FOX NEWS HOST: The book is out right now, right?KILMEADE: Yes. And it is really - a lot of it is how he evolves as a person, where he came from, how he lost everything, how he got fired four times, how he bounced all the way back and how he's now running a major company. He's got a podcast now where he's got his own imprint in these books. It's off his imprint.DOOCY: Wow.KILMEADE: So, he's - he's got 17 employees on a daily basis. So, he wanted to be unfirable. He was tired of being fired by people, so he became an owner. And I just think that this is - this is most of - most of all, this is a road map to success, full of setbacks, but it didn't bother him. He just kept coming back. And that's the main message.EARHARDT: He's from a very small town in South Carolina, Monks Corner, which is close to Charleston.KILMEADE: Right.JONES: Great job, Brian.DOOCY: (INAUDIBLE).EARHARDT: Yes, great.JONES: A great get, too.KILMEADE: Right. Right.Yes, he - by the way, mom's a teacher. Gives all of the credit to. His dad - him and dad are tight. But along the way he felt as his dad let him down as not being the role model he thought he was. So, this is how real and the book is. It's unvarnished.DOOCY: Well, great interview.EARHARDT: Absolutely. That was excellent.
