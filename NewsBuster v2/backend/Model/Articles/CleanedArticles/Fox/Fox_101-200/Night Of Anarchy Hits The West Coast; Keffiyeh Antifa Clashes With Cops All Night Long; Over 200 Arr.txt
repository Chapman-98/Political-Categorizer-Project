Stay tuned.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh my goodness.(PEOPLE cheering)WATTERS: Campus Day of Rage shocks the nation. Biden has got a problem.DON LEMON, FORMER CNN ANCHOR: DEI, it's not all, you know, roses. It's gone too far, it's become a religion.WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday, Lemon.LEMON: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.CANDACE CAMERON BURE, ACTRESS: Not everyone in Hollywood lives behind guard gates. We didn't feel safe anymore and that was the biggest reason that we moved.WATTERS: Los Angeles, no longer safe for models and actresses. Candace Cameron Bure joins PRIMETIME.("FULL HOUSE" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)DJ TANNER, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: Oh Mylanta.WATTERS: Plus --JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: What you think about him?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who was that?BELISARIO: His last name is Kennedy.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Isn't he like dead?WATTERS: Fox News Alert: A night of anarchy on the West Coast after Keffiyeh Antifa got their hands on more weapons than Zelenskyy.The West Coast Martyrs Brigade stormed UCLA's campus last night, strapped with helmets, gas masks, and riot gear. Not your typical mostly peaceful protesters. Weapons of choice included fire extinguishers, bottles, two by fours, and umbrellas.Clashes with the police went on until the crack of dawn.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: Over 200 arrests made overnight, cops snatching their masks off like Scooby Doo villains. Wait, that's not a college student, that's a 40- year-old woman.Other protesters cuffed and frog-marched grinning ear to ear. Their parents must be so proud.At Portland State University, anarchists also laid siege to a library that was, let's be honest, already empty. Police reports said the only books they stole were comic books, but then they retreated from the library when the cops arrived. Watch.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: Making a shield from a Rubbermaid trash can like a homeless middle schooler playing Dungeons and Dragons? Oscar-the-Grouch-o-Marx? Never played football because he bounced off that cop like a bowling pin. Running towards police in a bankruptcy barrel, not the brightest escape tactic.Police don't know what to expect. Is that Hacksaw Jim Duggan or Mary Poppins?Bodycam footage just released the moment the NYPD busted up Colombia's liberation zone.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Back. Go through it. Sit down Sit down. Sit down.Sit down so you don't get hurt.Sit down. Stay on the ground. Stay there.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Free, free Palestine.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Joe Biden ran on unifying the country and he has. Now, the left and the right are chanting "Let's go Brandon" in pitch perfect harmony.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CROWD chanting "(Bleep) Joe Biden.")(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Music to my ears. Good thing Biden is already hearing it. But this morning, he had "Morning Joe" cranked up to a 10.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: How do the Democrats -- how do all of us on that side say January 6 was wrong if you can have the same pictures going on, on college campuses?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good Lord, don't make a parallel with January 6.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The riots on college campuses, the riots at the Chicago Convention in '68, all of those things moved my family from being Democrats their entire life to being Republicans.If you're offended by this, please, I'm trying to help you. I don't want Donald Trump to get elected, all right? Trying to help you.If you're too stupid to figure that out, you change to another channel.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden got the message. His favorite TV show is telling him he's going to lose in a landslide to a law and order candidate like Nixon, because of campus chaos. And history has a way of repeating itself.After 10 days of silence, to save his presidency, Biden held the press conference and said, "Don't."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're a civil society and order must prevail.Throughout our history, we've often faced moments like this because we are a big, diverse, free thinking, and freedom loving nation and moments like this are always those who rush in to score political points.But this isn't a moment for politics, it is a moment for clarity. There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind, whether it's antisemitism, Islamophobia, or discrimination against Arab-Americans or Palestinian-Americans.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden told Republicans not to pounce and condemned Islamophobia. Has anybody seen any Islamophobia? All we've seen is antisemitism and so incredibly brave to come out against violence, Churchillian.He could have said that during the Summer of Love. I wonder what changed.Now while Biden tries to save his political hide, Trump, who has been beating this drum for a week, thanked cops and demanded Biden stop seeking prosecutors on him, when the real threat is on the radical left.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So proud of the New York's finest. They are great, great people, too and there are so many of them. They're incredible. They did her job at Columbia and likewise, in Los Angeles, they did a really good job at UCLA.This is a movement from the left, not from the right. The right is not your problem.The law enforcement and people at DOJ, instead of going after Donald Trump, they ought to look at what's happening in their own offices, because you load it up with radical left people that want this country to fail and we are not going to let this country fail.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The Iranians are offering scholarships now to American protesters. A terrorist state wants to sponsor these little Johnny Jihads who swear allegiance to Hamas on the quad. Why isn't the FBI and media unmasking these traitors?A woman's life got turned upside down and inside out because she opened up a hair salon during the pandemic just to feed her family. No one is even a little curious about this radical crew?There's a terror nexus staring us right in the face. Bill Ayers, former Weather Underground, former domestic terrorist, the guy's group who bombed the Pentagon, he is out there inspiring the University of Chicago Brigade with stories of revolutions past, and he is a professor at the school there. No wonder it's out of control.Stanford University called in the FBI when a man wearing a Hamas headband was spotted on campus. Nick Sandmann wear a MAGA hat and the media wrote 100,000 words about him. This guy with a Hamas headband, flies right under the radar.During the George Floyd riots, America saw four months of mayhem, thousands of cops injured, two dozen dead, $2 billion in damage. Almost no one went to prison. Mob rule won.Four years later, they have the same expectations. Biden can say "don't" all he wants, our enemies won't listen to him. Why would our citizens?You can smack an old lady's head off and walk out with no bail. No one is worried about going to jail for a protest. You think the foreign exchange students hoisting the Palestinian flag are worried about being deported. Biden hasn't deported anybody.They see a justice system focused on prosecuting Republicans, not them. They're not stopping at Free Palestine either. This movement has morphed into a grab bag of your typical anti-American activism.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PROTESTER: We demand that U Chicago repair the harm it has caused in Palestine, Chicago, and beyond. This includes explicitly acknowledging such harm, as well as implementing a communally accountable program of reparation.Disbanding UCPD, decarbonizing the endowment, and reducing emissions by 50 percent by 2030.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Reparations? Defund the police? Global warming? What does that have to do with Gaza?And how does divesting from Israel help Palestinians? It doesn't.These protests aren't helping anyone. The protesters aren't even helping themselves. No one's going to hire these psychos after their identities break. They've lost the plot.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHARPTON: Anytime what you are protesting for become secondary to what you are doing, then you're really not protesting for it. And you in many ways dramatize.What we did in the 80s, what I did later in other situations was to bring attention to a cause, not become the cause.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.SHARPTON: And what is troubling me about a lot of this is they've become the cause, it's about them. It is not about pushing the cause. They lost the message.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Everybody wants to fight the power in college, it's a rite of passage, but what is to fight? Life is too good in America, but they still want to suffer for their cause. So their idea of the struggle is losing their meal plan because they're living in a tent.They want the cops to hurt them a little. It's the only time they'll ever feel real pain, it makes them feel alive. They're raging against the machine that dropped the SATs, paid off their loans, and hired them just for their identity. Isn't that what they wanted?Francis Fukuyama warned in the end of history, that "If men cannot struggle on behalf of a just cause, then they struggle for the sake of struggle (out of boredom) for they cannot imagine living in a world without struggle" and there is plenty of people willing to finance the struggle.PBD flagged the financial reason why the Ivy's have gone so soft on Arab Spring Break. They get half their money from donations and gifts and a lot of that money pours in from the Mideast.We saw how Chinese money can massage a university's posture. Money talks in many different languages.Look around the campfire and see who is smiling while America burns.Cornell Law Professor William Jacobson joins me now.So, you went through it a little bit? What's going on with you, Professor?WILLIAM JACOBSON, CORNELL LAW PROFESSOR: Yes, well, when I spoke out against Black Lives Matter, I was targeted, but there is a much bigger problem now than the riots of 2020.We have on our campuses and in our cities, a marriage between the extreme left. The extreme left that wants to tear us down, that hates the United States, is anti-American, anti-Western, anti-capitalist, and the Islamists who hate America, hate Israel.So everything you're seeing is really a social contagion. You have highly ideologically motivated leaders, organizers and you have a bunch of students who many of them, maybe not most, but many of them are going along because it's the thing to do.Hating Israel, hating the United States, chanting almost like cult-like phrases back and forth has captured a lot of the campuses.But this is a serious situation. It's the extreme left that wants to tear us down, almost Khmer Rouge, go back to Year Zero, and start over and the extreme Islamists, who are worshipping Hamas, who want to take us back to the Eighth Century.So this is really a wake-up call for this country, that what is happening now is not just a social contagion, it is extremely dangerous and this marriage of the extreme left and the Islamist is not something that we've really seen before and people need to recognize this is a serious situation.WATTERS: So, the Department of Justice tried to frame and concoct a connection between the right and Russia. Remember what they did there with Trump-Russia collusion? They did that fraudulently. There was never any connection between the right and Russia.Here, you have the radical left. There's a direct connection between Islamic forces. It is staring us right in the face. They're chanting it, they're financing it. They're encouraging it.How come the Feds aren't looking at this the way they looked at the fake Trump-Russia collusion?JACOBSON: You know, that's a great question because what we're seeing is right out in the open. They are not even trying to hide it. They're wearing Hamas headbands. They're praising Hamas.They are projecting on buildings "Glory to the martyrs." They are chanting for an Intifada, which was the bloody suicide bombing campaign that killed over a thousand Israeli Jews.They chant "from the river to the sea" in English, but the Islamists who were chanting when they chant it in Arabic, they chant "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be Arab." So you have manipulation going on here.You have students who want to just be part of the crowd, just like in prior experiences, but it is worse now because the people who are driving this and manipulating it and speaking on really as the mouthpieces of Hamas and of the Iranian regime have the worst intentions for our country.WATTERS: Yes, they sure do.JACOBSON: I don't think it's any --WATTERS: They sure do, and if you're a Republican waving a Russian flag, chanting "praise Putin." Oh, you're getting a knock on your door. These people, they don't mind. They let them do it all day and it's just not right. There's a national security situation here we've got to look into it.Professor, thanks as always.JACOBSON: Great. Thank you.WATTERS: Across American universities, Arab Spring Breakers have been tearing down American flags and flying Palestinian ones, but when a mob pulled these shenanigans at UNC Chapel Hill, patriotic fraternity brothers stepped in and said "Not today, Hamas."(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: The brothers in Pi Kappa Phi defended the flag making sure it never touched the ground. One of the Jewish brothers held up his Israeli flag. This made the Keffiyeh Karens livid. They cursed them out, doused them in water, but they stood strong, like the men of Iwo Jima.The moment resonated with the nation and to show their appreciation for these young Americans, a GoFundMe was set up so the brothers could throw a rager.It is going to be the party of the year because almost a half a million dollars was already raised.UNC Chapel Hill fraternity brother, Brendan Rosenblum joins me now.Brendan, describe how this situation got started. Take us through it.BRENDAN ROSENBLUM, UNC CHAPEL HILL STUDENT: Yes, first of all, thank you so much, Jesse, for having me. I really appreciate it.Basically, there is a protest after five days of encampment on UNC Chapel Hill. I showed up by myself at first and then my friend, Trevor came and we held the Israeli flag while they protested. That protest led to the middle of campus, where we then went back to the South Building where they were standing and we watched them chant "Intifada, Intifada. From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free." And as they did that, they tore down the American flag.After that, they continued to stay there and then our chancellor and the police went to the middle of campus to put the flag back up, which they did. And then they had to eventually leave because of the protesters. That's when me and my fraternity brothers went to the middle of campus, and I held the Israeli flag, and they held up the American flag, while protesters chanted at us, screamed at us.I was told to kill myself about 50 times, called a White supremacist, a fascist. It was a really troubling scene. But we stood there strong, representing what we believe in.WATTERS: Good. Who were these people? Were they even students?ROSENBLUM: So a lot of them were students, but I would say there were also a lot of people that were not students. There was a woman there that basically was calling me a chicken and telling me to go to the front of the crowd, so I could be beaten up.And I think that's the problem, these people that don't belong on this campus shouldn't be here. They make us feel unsafe. A lot of the students here are peacefully protesting. They have the right to protest, and they should execute that right.However, if you don't belong to this campus, you should not be here and you should not advocate against Israel. You should not advocate against anything because you don't belong here.WATTERS: Absolutely. What are you guys going to do with this money?ROSENBLUM: Unfortunately, we don't have real control of the money. It's not up to us and it's not in our hands. I will say we appreciate the support and we appreciate everyone trying to reach out and support our core values ad what we believe in.WATTERS: All right, well. listen, Brendan, if you do get your hands on the money, maybe throw a party but maybe donate a little to charity. Still throw a party, little to charity, do the right thing.A lot of respect for you guys. It's good to know that there's some patriotic young men out there supporting the flag still out there. Thank you so much. Good luck out there.ROSENBLUM: Thank you so much. Appreciate it, Jesse.WATTERS: Johnny talks to voters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Trump or Biden?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Trump because he gave us stimulus checks.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Fox News Alert: Bloomberg reporting Trump has narrowed down his VP list to four candidates. You ready?Ohio Senator JD Vance, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.A lot of people missing from the list -- Kristi Noem, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Vivek, Tulsi -- but this just could be a smokescreen planted by the Trump team so they shock everybody when he announces in July and picks DeSantis. Kidding, maybe I'm not. We'll keep you updated.Trump and Biden were both on the move today. Biden was in North Carolina talking about lead pipes and chemicals.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: We are detecting and removing so-called forever chemicals referred to as P-FAS. P-dash-F-A-S-dash.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Trump's in New York delivering pizza to firefighters.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)(PEOPLE cheering and applauding)WATTERS: Trump shook some hands, signed some autographs and talked with the guys.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Good looking group, huh?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sir, please save us. Save us.TRUMP: You guys are so respected, you don't even know. You don't even know.We've got to give them the good signature now, right?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, yes. The whole thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Now Trump is in New York because it's Day 10 of the trial where they won't tell us what the crime is. He said: "Contrary to the fake news media, I don't fall asleep during the crooked DA's witch hunt, especially not today. I simply close my beautiful blue eyes sometimes, listen intensely, and take it all in."Tulsi Gabbard was a former presidential candidate and author of "For the Love of Country." I should have used that excuse in math class.TULSI GABBARD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.WATTERS: All right, it's just --GABBARD: Close those beautiful eyes, Jesse.WATTERS: Taking it all in.The images of Trump, the pizza delivery man.GABBARD: Yes.WATTERS: There's nothing like Trump holding pizza. It's like he thinks it's gold, but people love it.GABBARD: It is New York pizza.WATTERS: It's different. It is New York pizza. These play well. You've got the bodega. You've got the pizza man.GABBARD: Yes.WATTERS: You've got the construction site. It is just getting traction.GABBARD: I mean, the images I think speak for themselves that Trump is out here and he is with the people and the other clip that you played of the P- dash-F-A-S-dash speech. You know, they're getting exactly what they wanted.President Biden and the Democratic league, they can't compete on the issues, so they are trying to essentially keep President Trump locked up in a courtroom wherever and for however long they can, drain him of his time and his resources.President Biden is no less blatant than dictators we see like Putin and others and other pseudo democracies, where they weaponize these public institutions to go after their political opponent, whether it's the Department of Justice, law enforcement, all of these different agencies to try to save us, the American people, from making the "wrong choice."And this is what I talk about in the book, is that they are destroying our democracy in order to save it and they really believe that they are justified in doing this.WATTERS: Yes, we're going to get to the book in a second. So Trump has pizza and he is with firefighters and he is telling the federal government, can you stop prosecuting me? Because we have Hamas lovers out there coordinating with Iranians, possibly, screaming in the streets "kill the Jews" and the DOJ is out to lunch.GABBARD: The DOJ is out to lunch. President Biden gave a very, very weak statement today refusing to speak the truth about calling out these pro- Hamas terrorist apologists for exactly who they are, and the danger that this poses, the greater danger that this poses, obviously, they're disturbing the peace and undermining the rule of law in our cities and communities.What we're seeing is a symptom of the radical Islamist ideology, ideological warfare.WATTERS: So Tulsi has got a new book. It's called "For the Love of Country: Leave the Democratic Party Behind." I just started it. I absolutely love it. Tell us why we need to get this book.GABBARD: Our country is under threat. Our freedom is under attack. The Democrats and the Biden administration are responsible. We need to defeat them in this election to save our country.WATTERS: All right, Tulsi Gabbard, that's good. That's good. It's good.Tulsi, thank you so much.GABBARD: Thanks, Jesse. Great seeing you.WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Another Boeing whistleblower dead after contracting a mysterious infection. Senior national correspondent, Kevin Corke has details.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Jesse, it has happened again.Joshua Dean, a former quality auditor who sounded the alarm about a supplier who'd been ignoring defects in the production of Boeing's 737 Max jets is dead and what's more, he is now the second whistleblower to die not long after disclosing problems involving Boeing.Dean's aunt says he went to a hospital in Wichita after experiencing breathing difficulties, and during his stay, he allegedly developed MRSA, pneumonia, needed to be intubated. Shortly thereafter, he died suddenly.Now, you may recall, it was just a couple of months ago back in March, another Boeing whistleblower, John Barnett took his own life in the midst of a legal battle with Boeing. His team manufactured the door plug that blew out midair on an Alaska Airlines flight back in January.Shortly thereafter, he told "The Wall Street Journal" he was fired, because he simply pointed out that the holes were drilled in the wrong spot on the fuselage, something his employer vigorously denied.In February, he also told NPR he thought Boeing was sending a message that if you're too loud, we will simply silence you. And to add to the growing number of very interesting questions about this case, both deceased whistleblowers are represented by the very same South Carolina law firm. I don't know what to make of that -- Jesse.WATTERS: Very mysterious Kevin.CORKE: Yes.WATTERS: We'll continue to follow it. Thank you so much.CORKE: You bet.WATTERS: Since the 1920s, Los Angeles has been the film and television capital of the world, a magnet for beautiful and talented women looking to hit it big.Audrey Hepburn came all the way from Belgium. Elizabeth Taylor made the voyage from Great Britain. Lucille Ball came from Brooklyn.But now actresses and cover girls can't seem to get out of Hollywood fast enough, as "Sports Illustrated" models scared to go to the store.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Is there going to be a model exodus?KRISTEN LOUELLE GAFFNEY, SPORTS ILLUSTRATED MODEL: You know, you come to California to -- it is the City of Dreams, the state of dreams, right? You think this is where I can accomplish anything, but it does not feel safe anymore. I don't feel safe going to the grocery store.I don't go anywhere outside, especially in metropolitan areas without my husband with me. And I certainly don't take my kids into city limits.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: First, it was the homeless, then it was crime, then migrants, and now, Arab Spring Breakers are taking over campus.Even Hollywood lifers are leaving. Actress Candace Cameron Bure was born and raised in LA, but she just hightailed it out of there.Candace Cameron Bure, star of the new movie "Unsung Hero" joins me now.Candace, why did you leave?BURE: Hi, Jesse.WATTERS: Hey.BURE: Well, my family and I didn't feel safe anymore. We didn't live behind closed gates and I feel like that's part of the protection you know, that you can feel and being someone that's in the public eye, a lot of people would show up at our door and it was quite unnerving and paparazzi and all kinds of things.So we moved out of Los Angeles.WATTERS: You're not allowed to have a gun. You can't have a guard dog. You just said, I'm out.BURE: Oh, no, we have both of those.WATTERS: Really? It's that crazy.BURE: Yes. Yes. Yes, to the point where it just -- yes, it wasn't worth it for us anymore. We're also in a different stage of life.I have three grown children and they're not living in LA anymore, either and I want to be where they are.WATTERS: Was it like, "Mommy, mommy, who's that homeless junkie with a mace?"BURE: You'd be surprised.WATTERS: Okay, maybe I'm overdoing it a little bit. Tell us about this movie, "Unsung Hero."BURE: Well, we are the number two movie in America right now and the number one faith-based movie and it is a beautiful story that celebrates moms, the unsung hero. It's about miracles. It's about hope.It is based on the real-life story of the Smallbone family, you might know them from the band, For King and Country or the singer Rebecca St. James.And this story is about how they emigrated from Australia to America, lost absolutely everything and their mom made life an adventure. They slept on beds made of clothes. They started a lawn mowing business so they could put food on the table.And it is full of adventure and miracles and tears, but happy ones. It's a strong story of faith. And I'm so proud to be a part of it. I'm in the movie, but also executive produced it.WATTERS: Oh, you big show off. Candace Cameron Bure, thanks for joining JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME, and off to greener pastures.BURE: Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: Good luck.BURE: Yes.WATTERS: Who's RFK, Jr. taking votes from?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: The polls say he's taking more from Biden?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Polls also said that Hillary would win.BELISARIO: That didn't work out.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, absolutely not.BELISARIO: Were you sad?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I don't like Hillary.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Who does RFK, Jr hurt?

We're bringing you the best stories about diversity, equity, and inclusion.First up, Kamala Harris went on "The Drew Barrymore Show" the other day. Remember?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DREW BARRYMORE, TALK SHOW HOST: We all need a mom. I've been thinking that we really all need a tremendous hug in the world right now. But in our country, we need you to be Momala of the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: "New York Times" race baiter Charles Blow didn't like that, not because Drew Barrymore wasn't social distancing, but because he thinks Drew Barrymore is racist.He wrote this in "The New York Times," "It's an illustration of the nanny- fication of Black women that cast them as racialized humans security blankets."Blow thinks calling Kamala Momala was racist, but Kamala has been calling herself Momala for years.

Suck it up and leave.Well, and you know what? Maybe they should.No DEI Thursday is complete without a PRIMETIME victory. You know, the left has gone too far when Don Lemon is calling DEI a cult.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LEMON: I think a lot of media companies need to do some self-examination about what's happening inside the company. DEI is -- look, there's some great things about DEI, but it's not all, you know, roses. And I think we need to take a look at it and we need to sort of do some rejiggering because it's gone too far, it has become a religion.And if you don't abide by the religion, then you get kicked out of the church.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Oh, Happy DEI Thursday, everybody.
