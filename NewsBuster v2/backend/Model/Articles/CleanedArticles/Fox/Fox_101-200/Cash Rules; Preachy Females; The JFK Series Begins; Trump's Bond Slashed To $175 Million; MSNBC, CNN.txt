NEIL KAYSER, WASHINGTON CATTLE PRODUCER: We are going to continue to work and support the industry and our way of life, and there will be challenges. Yes.LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Neil, I'm going to come hang out there. Awesome to see you. Thanks so much.Up next, Jesse.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's a sad day for this country. But the good day is that the Appellate Division was fair. It could also make me more popular because the people know it's a scam.WATTERS: The left tries to steal Trump's fortune, but they strike out.REPORTER: What's your collateral on the bond?TRUMP: Cash.JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: We might be committing suicide.WATTERS: Democrats worry the Biden campaign is too feminine.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)JOHN F. KENNEDY, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: . before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.WATTERS: PRIMETIME's JFK series begins.Plus --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hey, Jesse.WATTERS: New Year's Eve 1999: The country was counting down until midnight getting ready to pop the champagne, but somewhere in the back of our heads, we thought the whole world would go haywire.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Airlines, banks, Wall Street, the military all are working feverishly to avoid problems with a computer glitch known as Y2K.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They can test and they can test and they can test, but not until the actual event do they really know.It's like sending up a space shuttle. They've got everything down. They think everything's all said, last minute, boom.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Nothing happened, and now it seems silly. But this morning, every reporter tightened their Windsor knots, steamed their pantsuits and started the Trump bankruptcy countdown.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Bank accounts frozen, property seized by the end of today, this could be a reality for Donald Trump.JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR: His assets, including some of these prized properties on the screen right there could be seized if you can't make a nearly half billion dollar bond payment by the end of the day.MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: One more for you, Donald Trump could be forced to declare bankruptcy if he is unable to post his more than $450 million bond.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Just like Y2K, the countdown ended with nothing. Trump's buildings weren't seized. He wasn't bankrupted. He actually made $4 billion today. More on that later.An Appeals Court said Trump doesn't have to put up half a billion dollar cash bond. Sorry, Judge Nudy and Letitia. The court slashed the number to $175 million.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It is a sad day in our country in many respects, but the good day is that the Appellate Division was fair. It's a lot of money still, but the judge is corrupt, in my opinion.Greatly respect the decision of the Appellate Division and we will abide by that. We will put up in cash or bond very quickly.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: This is what it'll look like.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: What's your collateral for the bond?TRUMP: Cash.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The Appellate Court not only cut Judge Nudy's bond demand by more than half, the five-judge panel is signaling that Trump will probably win the case easily on appeal, reversing almost the entire Judge Nudy ruling while the case plays out, allowing Trump to still run his company and apply for loans; same with Eric and Don, Jr.Humiliating Trump, padlocking his properties and stealing his cash before the election, that won't happen. Today, was a good day for America.You can't bankrupt the man just for beating Biden in the polls.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I have a lot of cash. You know I do because you're looking at my statements.But I would also like to be able to use some of my cash to get elected. They don't want me to use my cash to get elected. They don't want that. They don't want me taking cash out to use it for the campaign.REPORTER: Are you going to start putting money into your campaign?TRUMP: Yes.REPORTER: You haven't done that since 2016.TRUMP: Yes. Well, first of all, it's none of your business. I mean, frankly, but I might -- I might do that. I have the option.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Every indictment helps Trump and every court victory helps him even more. We are witnessing a political injustice and every day that he survives, he looks stronger, and Joe Biden looks weaker and the system more corrupt.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: This is all about election interference. This is all Biden run things, meaning Biden and his thugs. They can't win an election because of the borders, because of energy prices, because of inflation, because of Afghanistan, the worst and most embarrassing day in the history of our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: This was too much for MSNBC and CNN who punched the censor button while he was just warming up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Well, I respect the Appellate Division for substantially reducing that ridiculous amount of money that was put on by a corrupt judge named Engoron, he ought to be looked at.MSNBC HOST: And so we'll continue to listen into Donald Trump, but as he continues to make what are provably wrong statements --BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Trump there laying out a plethora of falsehoods. Perhaps the most blatant one that all of these criminal cases were orchestrated by President Biden.As the president is answering questions from reporters, more falsehoods from former President Donald Trump, again, repeating this false claim that President Joe Biden is behind the slew of legal issues that he is facing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That's not false. Letitia, Fani, Lover Boy, Jack Smith's team all visited or coordinated with the White House. White House visitor logs don't lie. Convicting Trump before November is the centerpiece of the Biden re- election campaign, which is why every time cases get calendared or Trump wins on appeal, the media turns suicidal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRISTAN SNELL, FORMER NEW YORK ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Honestly, this is so infuriating, I don't even know what to do. I don't even know if I care what the process is. He basically fashioned himself his own private militia to try to take over the Capitol.You know, now he's getting his own private system of justice. This is an absolute travesty. It would not happen for anybody else. Anybody else, it would be like, sorry, buddy, you lost. Pay up. For him, he gets his own set of rules.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Trump is getting special treatment by the legal system? Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was provided more due process. Trump is facing five cases from four Democrat prosecutors with zero victims and Democrats are furious that he still owns a home.Get ready to get even angrier, because on the same day his bond was slashed in half, Trump's social's parent company, Truth Social, their stock soared 35 percent giving Trump a $4 billion cash injection.Trump's net worth just hit $6.5 billion on paper, making him one of the world's 500 richest people.Over the weekend, Joe Biden nicknamed Trump Broke Don, better find a new nickname.Let's bring in Trump legal spokeswoman, Alina Habba.Alina, what happened today?ALINA HABBA, DONALD TRUMP SPOKESPERSON: We won. You know, no, we didn't win. You know when we will win? When we get this all reversed, which is what's going to happen.So what happened today was that Letitia had to eat every single tweet she has posted since the day the twisted order from Judge Engoron came out with the ridiculous number, with the disgusting injustice on the American people, not just Donald Trump and I would love to see what she tweeted today because she was having fun posting the interest on a man who has done nothing wrong and a family who has done nothing wrong every single day.And then the Appellate Division came in and said, sorry. Due process still exists in America. You still get a right to keep your assets until we get to review what all these lawyers are saying was wrong.Eleven weeks, I have never seen something, Jesse, like I saw in that courtroom. It was a travesty on the justice system. And I am so proud of the Appellate Division for giving us the opportunity.They didn't reverse the case, but they will when they see what we saw. It was a disgrace. And today, there was a little bit of faith in the American system that I've lost over the past few years, I'll be honest with you.WATTERS: Do you think Tish James and Judge Engoron, do they feel ashamed? A little embarrassed? Have they felt -- I don't know, maybe they overreached a little bit after this decision?HABBA: Well, that would mean that they have a moral compass or a conscience and I don't feel that that exists. People that go on TV, censor Donald Trump, shut him off when he's speaking, want to act like he's about to go broke, want to act like he's poor and that is why he couldn't get a bond that no private company has ever been asked to get, with no cash equivalents other than cash, marketable securities.People that get excited for that, they don't have a conscience, Jesse. But you know, I hope she took a little piece of humble pie today, because that's what was served to her, just a little, but we'll be serving a lot more of that in the next couple of years.WATTERS: And she'll be eating humble pie. You'll be having birthday cake. We hear it's your birthday. So happy birthday.HABBA: Thank you, Jesse. Thank you.WATTERS: All right, behave yourself.Let's bring in a real estate investor, Grant Cardone.Grant, today, you had predicted, if they started seizing these things, it was going to be hell on Earth in this country. Today, what's your reaction?GRANT CARDONE, REAL ESTATE INVESTOR: Well, first of all, I want to congratulate the president -- the former President Donald Trump for proving himself as the greatest negotiator of any American president that has ever lived. Sixty-five percent discount on the fines, the punishment, the sanction that was ridiculous, and probably a $3.6 billion rebound with his social stock.Look, people that are investing in real estate should be elated today because this is property seizure at the least and a sanction at the worst. We blew out of New York City five weeks ago after the injunction because I didn't feel like I can invest there on behalf of our investors, not knowing what kind of overreach people could do to me. If they can do that to Trump, they could do it to me, certainly.WATTERS: So you left New York, you're gone. No more business here.CARDONE: We had $500 million to place there this year, and placed it last week in Miami and Texas instead. Most of it in Miami.WATTERS: Are you hearing other people in industry doing similar things?CARDONE: One hundred percent. There's people that won't underwrite deals in New York. And by the way, it's going to be a contagion spread to Illinois, Chicago -- big cities, blue cities -- San Francisco, LA. People are worried about putting their money into these markets and not be able to control the laws.Property taxes are out-of-control. To be able to sanction a man for appraisals that we all do exactly the way Trump did his by the way, that is an industry standard approved method and has been used for 40 years that I've been buying real estate. I assess the value, third parties assess the value and then we bring those values together.WATTERS: Right.Grant, money talks and you're speaking very loudly with that kind of cash. Thank you so much. Good luck.CARDONE: Thank you.WATTERS: Fox News Alert: Homeland Security agents raiding hip-hop mogul, Sean Diddy Combs' LA and Miami Holmes in connection to a Federal sex trafficking investigation. Diddy has been the subject of numerous rape and sexual assault allegations alleging years of wrongdoing.National correspondent Bill Melugin is here with the latest -- Bill.BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jesse, our federal sources tell us these raids at P. Diddy's properties were in connection to a federal sex trafficking probe.You can see here heavily armed federal agents can be seen rating Sean Diddy Combs' home right here in LA in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles. Several people could be seen being escorted from the property, some appearing to be detained or arrested, some in handcuffs.Meanwhile, in Miami, some federal agents arrived at Combs' waterfront property by boat conducting a raid there as well. Sources tell Fox this had to do with a federal sex trafficking investigation, but officially HSI is only saying: "Earlier today, Homeland Security Investigations New York executed law enforcement actions as part of an ongoing investigation with assistance from HSI Los Angeles, HSI Miami, and our local law enforcement partners. We will provide further information as it becomes available."Now, last year, three women accused Combs of abuse in two separate lawsuits. The day after the first lawsuit was filed, Combs and the woman, singer Cassandra Ventura agreed on a settlement. In the second lawsuit filed last November, two women claimed Combs sexually -- forcefully drugged them and sexually assaulted them back in the 1990s.Then two months ago, a male music producer also sued Combs, accusing him of abuse including unsolicited groping and sexual touching.Now a lawyer representing Combs has described that lawsuit as "pure fiction." But Jesse, the big question is, where is P. Diddy tonight?Well, TMZ is reporting they've just tracked his private jet to Antigua in the Caribbean, though it's unclear if Combs himself is onboard that plane.We'll send it back to you.WATTERS: All right, thanks so much. Very interesting.We'll have more on that tomorrow.Johnny talks relationships.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: When you guys would fight, what would happen?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was more of the louder person.BELISARIO: How loud did you get?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just stop it and listen. You're so hardheaded.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Joe Biden had some company this weekend, Barack and Nancy appearing alongside the president where the three of them got a chance to catch up and resuscitate a few old hoaxes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Donald Trump is about the past and serving himself. This is the guy who doesn't care about science and reason.Remember, during the pandemic Donald Trump told us to inject ourselves with bleach. He said there's nothing to worry about if you do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The show of force is disguising a mess behind the scenes.Obama has been meeting privately with Biden, warning him that his campaigns being bottlenecked and he needs to get it together, not a book plug -- or else Trump will win in a landslide.Clinton World sees a landslide coming, too. The raging Cajun, James Carville says every time a new poll drops, it is like seeing his grandmother naked.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARVILLE: I don't think people really appreciate how bad Biden's poll numbers are. When you look at him, it is like walking out on your grandmother naked. You can't unsee it, no matter how hard you try it.And the deeper you dig, the kind of worse it is. I don't think we thought this thing through. I don't think people realize the hunger and appetite for something different in this country. We might be committing suicide.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Carville says the Biden campaign is sleepwalking into a beating. The country is begging for change, but cowardly Democrats would rather just lose with Joe.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARVILLE: We need more than a little bit of change to end this.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a crapshoot whether, you know, Biden is our nominee. If you decide that you're going to blow up where we are now and open up a convention and have a brokered convention, whatever. That could also be dangerous.CARVILLE: It looks like the party has decided that okay, we're just going to go through with this. And I've been a Democrat all my life, but I've been forgetting to think that the defining trait we have is cowardness. I can't unsee my naked grandma.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Then Carville twisted the knife in "The New York Times," saying the Biden campaign is too girly: "A suspicion of mine is that there are too many preachy females. They don't drink beer, don't watch football, don't eat hamburgers. This is not good for you. The message is too feminine. Everything you're doing is destroying the planet, you've got to eat your peas."Now, "The Five" has have been saying this for a while.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL COP-HOST, "THE FIVE": This is a party about abortion and it it's a party for women and men of every color are seeing how they are being abandoned by being branded as the lowest on the totem pole of identity.This is what happens with identity politics. You create a hierarchy, right, of identities and one gets stacked on the other and all this energy is placed on pigment and not people.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: I never thought Gutfeld and Carville would be the ones speaking bravely on behalf of men. Men have been neglected for far too long: "If you listen to Democratic elites, NPR is my go to place for that. The whole talk is about how women and women of color are going to decide this election. I'm like, well, 48 percent of the people that vote are males. Do you mind if they have some consideration?"Carville says preachy females are ruining politics. The squad, Pelosi, Kamala, Binder, "The View," every woman on MSNBC or everyone who identifies as a woman on MSNBC, not my words, Carville said it.AOC is peeved. She says: "Maybe he should start a podcast about it. I hear men are really underrepresented in that space."Where did all the men go in the Democrat Part ? Manchin is leaving. All the male mayors, all they do is blame and complain. Where are the men of action on the left?Whatever happened to Newsom? All they have left is like Fetterman, barely.Trump is at football games, UFC fights. He is not nagging us about what kind of car to drive. He just wants to protect the country, not in the pronouns.Biden is falling off bikes, licking ice cream cones, and sipping through straws, and leaving the gates to the country wide open. He is apologizing to illegal immigrants after they murder our women.The Democrats spend all day in sexual harassment training seminars and DEI inclusion therapy, jockeying to be the biggest victim. Carville continues: "No one wants to live like this." He said, "Whoever thought it was a good idea to tell people you can't hug them or you've got to be careful or you've got to think about names to call them other than the name you know them by. There's nothing wrong with me being White, or you being White, or them being Black or me being male or you being female. It's a giant, stupid argument."Nomiki is the director of Matriarch and she joins us now.You're a Democrat --NOMIKI KONST, DIRECTOR, MATRIARCH: And a woman.WATTERS: And you're a woman.KONST: And a woman.WATTERS: And you are a preachy female, says James Carville,KONST: James Carville, Mister, economy stupid. That's his famous line, it is the economy stupid -- should know and understand that women drive this economy. It is working women who are driving this economy right now.It has been proven that women, there is statistics everywhere that they're the ones controlling the bank accounts in the homes across America.WATTERS: Well that's right everybody has a massive credit card debt, Nomiki, if you guys are in charge of the credit cards.KONST: Whether you're in the suburbs -- no you're spending it. You're spending it.No, no. But --WATTERS: I think you're spending it. You should see the boxes that come to my house, but he is not talking about the economy. He's talking about the way politics.KONST: Yes.WATTERS: He says you are obsessed with gender and race, and it is driving everyone nuts, and it's driving men off of the Democratic Party reservation.KONST: Well, I think James Carville is used to his style of politics back in the day when he was talking to Bubba's in Alabama, which is fine and that was his style.But nowadays, the modern Democratic Party and the country is voting in a multigenerational, multi-ethnic, majority female voting bloc.WATTERS: Right. But there's Bubba's everywhere.KONST: It's a real thing.WATTERS: It's not just about Alabama, and not every man is a Bubba, Nomiki.KONST: I am joking. That's his line. That's his line.WATTERS: Right. A lot of men feel annoyed that no one ever thinks about us, and you know how much we want to be thought of.I mean, you have a border that's wide open. No one asks a man to close it. It's wide open, the country can't protect itself. There's illegals killing everybody. And you guys are obsessed with DEI. Why can't we just focus on half of the country and get it together, not a book plug.KONST: Well, Jesse Watters, who is hosting this show, primetime slot on one of the highest rated networks on TV, I think you have a voice on TV.WATTERS: Yes.KONST: Whereas women are the ones winning the election. If we turn out our voters, James Carville knows that you have to focus on the voters that turn out, not the ones that you're not going to get. Unfortunately, there are going to be some voters who are going to vote for the Republicans, some men who want to listen to Donald Trump all day long.But there are also women across the country who are centrists, you know, progressives in the rural community, in suburbs.WATTERS: Nomiki, he is saying you're preachy?KONST: I'm talking so unfortunately, some people who are used to being in privilege do not like to hear equality and they think that's preachy.WATTERS: But it's not preachy. It's naggy. He is saying, all you guys do is tell everybody what to drive, what not to eat, what not to do.KONST: Well, women are controlling the economy. I don't think that's --WATTERS: And people get annoyed by that and he thinks it's driving men out of your party, and I think he's right. But I would never do that. I would never talk to a woman like that because I have more manners.KONST: Jesse, it's the economy stupid and women drive the economy. And James Carville knows that, he just feels left out right now.WATTERS: You're driving it into a ditch because inflation is killing everybody.KONST: Well, we will see that on 2024. Women got us 2020, we're going to get us 2024. That's how it is.WATTERS: All right, as long as we can get it together. That's all I care about. Thank you, Nomiki.KONST: Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: The JFK series begins tonight.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Hunter Biden's sugar brother, Kevin Morris has been bailing out Hunter and the Biden campaign for years, but who is he? All of a sudden a rich Democrat donor comes along and pays the family's back taxes, alimony, child support, private airfare, legal bills, living expenses, rent, even buys Hunter Biden's stupid paintings for a half a mil?Naturally, prosecutors wanted to interview the sugar brother since he's been the puppet master of the Biden family finances. But they never got a chance.A whistleblower says the CIA stopped prosecutors from talking to Biden donor, Kevin Morris. The whistleblower says two lawyers from Biden's Justice Department were summoned to CIA headquarters and told Hunter's sugar brother was off limits. Langley said Morris could not be a witness in their tax investigation into Hunter.Now this whistleblower report stacks up. The CIA is witness tampering to help President Biden win re-election. The CIA is interfering in another election. This time they're interfering in an active federal investigation into the First Family, and they have a long history of protecting the Biden's and injuring Trump.The agency started the Russia hoax, buried the laptop with the letter and covered up the lab leak. Remember, the CIA even triggered the Trump impeachment. An agent was on that perfect phone call and went straight to Adam Schiff. And now, the CIA is witness tampering in a Hunter Biden investigation.Is Kevin Morris an asset? Or is this just another example of Langley protecting Joe? The deep state has a dirty history reaching back decades, and I've been reading some books about JFK and we'll be starting a new series on PRIMETIME documenting the Kennedy presidency.JFK was on a collision course with the military industrial complex, which his predecessor Eisenhower warned us about.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DWIGHT EISENHOWER, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportion.So is the very structure of our society and the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex, the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist.We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: After Truman dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, he was infatuated with nuclear supremacy. Truman was downright giddy with the power he possessed and as JFK assumed office, he too recognized the power, but also the unspeakable terror of Cold War nuclear brinkmanship.As Kennedy sat across from Khrushchev in Vienna at the beginning of his presidency in '61, he handed the Soviet leader a gift, a model of the USS Constitution, and Kennedy noted that just a few cannon blasts would then kill a few people.But in '61, with both countries aiming their entire nuclear arsenals at each other, 70 million people would die just in the opening exchange.He looked across the table and Khrushchev gave him a blank stare, as if to say, "So what?" Kennedy was shocked, but continued to seek peace.In his inaugural address, he aimed for an off ramp from the Cold War.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KENNEDY: Finally, to those nations, who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge, but a request that both sides begin anew the quest for peace.Before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Fiction writers in the early 60s were writing about possible military coups in America, to which JFK remarked, I know a couple of generals who might wish they could.Now I'm going to be continuing to read some of these books about JFK, and we'll keep you updated every night.Former CIA officer and whistleblower, John Kiriakou joins us.John, now we have the CIA actively witness tampering in the Hunter Biden investigation. What does that tell you?JOHN KIRIAKOU, FORMER CIA AGENT: How crazy is this? Now, you know I thought about this all weekend, Jesse, and I'm just not able to come up with any legitimate reason why the CIA would tamper in this case, tampering this investigation, other than the fact that perhaps Mr. Morris is a source, or as you said, in the intro, the CIA wants Joe Biden to be re-elected.WATTERS: Do you believe that they like Joe Biden, because he is just the establishment guy, he does what the Pentagon wants, and he always has, I mean, he always has.KIRIAKOU: Yes, the CIA loves it when either presidents don't make waves that they are establishment presidents, or if there's an inexperienced president, they sometimes can get their hooks in early.Barack Obama, for example, had no real experience in intelligence or foreign affairs and so, the day after the election in 2008, he began getting a daily CIA briefing, and they hooked him.You know, once they show you a blue border report or black border report that's classified above top secret, and they say, Mr. President-elect, we want to tell you about the cool things that we're doing around the world. They've got their hooks in you, and then you work for them.WATTERS: But Trump was inexperienced as well as Barack Obama was even more so, but he wasn't able to be controlled. He kind of sniffed out some of the rouses they were playing with him, and they've done nothing since then but try to destroy him.KIRIAKOU: That's exactly right. And that's what happens when there's a president that they can't control. I think that maybe there are some parallels we can draw, even with the presidency of John F. Kennedy.WATTERS: Kennedy was actually going around the military officials, speaking directly with Khrushchev. They had private letters exchanged.KIRIAKOU: That's right.WATTERS: Because he wanted peace.KIRIAKOU: Yes, he did.KIRIAKOU: You know, we're going to continue to cover that because that is just one of those things that really breaks your heart.John, thank you.WATTERS: Yes, indeed. Thanks for having me.WATTERS: Well, the media and March Madness, right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: There's an old sports adage that defense wins championships and sometimes the best defense is a good offense. An LSU head women's basketball coach, Kim Mulkey went on offense in a big way during a press conference over the weekend.Before she got into breaking down the X's and O's. She called out "The Washington Post" for working on what she thinks is a hit piece on her. She's giving a masterclass on how to deal with bad faith journalists, threatening to sue "The Washington Post" after she found out the reporter was just trying to dig up dirt on her from like former players and disgruntled coaches.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KIM MULKEY, LSU HEAD COACH: Reporters who give a megaphone to a one-sided embellished version of things aren't trying to tell the truth, they are trying to sell newspapers and feed the click machine. This is exactly why people don't trust journalists and the media anymore.It's these kinds of sleazy tactics and hatchet jobs that people are just tired of. I'm fed up. And I'm not going to let "The Washington Post" attack this university, this awesome team of young women I have or me without a fight.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: She's talking about this reporter, Kent Babb, who is confirmed he's working on a profile of Mulkey. She says he reached out to the university with more than a dozen questions on Tuesday saying his deadline was Thursday. Right before tipoff.Mulkey said the timeline was ridiculous and impossible to meet. And guess what? As of showtime, the story hasn't been printed. It sounds like your defense is working.Fox News contributor Joe Concha joins me now.This is how they roll, Joe.JOE CONCHA, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Kent Babb has been working on this story for two years, Jesse.WATTERS: Come on.CONCHA: And then suddenly has a two-day deadline to get a dozen questions answered?WATTERS: Before the first game of the tournament.CONCHA: Precisely.Kim Mulkey is probably the best coach in the country right now and I'm talking about like all sports. Four national championships, defending national champ after winning last year. She won twice as a player 40 years ago.She has been coaching for probably longer than most of the staff of Jesse Watters' show has been alive, right? I mean, it's incredible.So why is she being targeted? Well, because she's a conservative for starters.WATTERS: Okay.CONCHA: And she actually had the audacity to accept an invitation from President Trump in 2019 when Baylor won and that caused backlash, because you can't go to the White House with your team and celebrate a national championship.But also, in terms of COVID testing, she said before a Final Four either last year or the year before saying they shouldn't do any testing before the Final Four, because if you dreamed your whole life and worked so hard to get there, that if a test comes back positive for a 20-year-old girl, it's not going to matter anyway because I'm pretty sure everybody's going to be a-okay.But this will probably be a hit piece because this reporter for whatever reason, "The Washington Post" has a big interest in LSU athletics did a story on Brian Kelly in 2022. Who is that? He's LSU football coach and shamed him for making the money that he does as an SEC football coach because Baton Rouge is a poor county.WATTERS: So "The Washington Post" reporters hate LSU and that makes us like LSU even more.CONCHA: Maybe. You want to hear one stat before we go?WATTERS: No, I don't have time.CONCHA: Are you sure?WATTERS: I love you, but no more stats.CONCHA: Oh, all right.WATTERS: My brain is full.CONCHA: It's about 10 seconds.WATTERS: Now you've wasted it.CONCHA: Oh. Dammit. Are you sure?WATTERS: Well, now you've -- now you've --CONCHA: I've teased it.WATTERS: God dammit. Just what do you want?CONCHA: All right, it will be fast."The Washington Post" has never endorsed Republican presidential candidate in its history. That means they endorsed Carter twice. Mondale who won one state, Gore, Kerry, Biden -- good track record.WATTERS: Ten seconds, just under the wire.CONCHA: Yay.WATTERS: Thank you very much.CONCHA: 9.9. Bye.WATTERS: PRIMETIME had a hunch.For some time that there was an ulterior motive at the southern border, and last night, "60 Minute" interview with Mexican President Lopez Obrador confirmed what we'd thought.
