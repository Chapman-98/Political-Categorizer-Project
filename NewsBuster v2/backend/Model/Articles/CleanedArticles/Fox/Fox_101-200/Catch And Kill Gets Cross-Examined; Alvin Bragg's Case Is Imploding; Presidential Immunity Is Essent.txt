You can catch me on "America Reports" tomorrow during the 2:00 PM Eastern hour, so be sure to tune in.Remember, it's America now and forever. I'll see on social media.Jesse Watters.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.Tonight --(PEOPLE chanting "USA.")WATTERS: Trump escapes the cage and makes a play.DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to be doing a rally at Madison Square Garden.(PEOPLE screaming)WATTERS: Who is behind the Arab Spring Break? A PRIMETIME investigation.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Show your face. Show your face. Why are you scared to show your face?KERMIT THE FROG: With more on this stormy weather, here is our weather person and bona fide meteorologist , Al Roker.AL ROKER: Thanks a lot, Kermit.Now, here is where the hurricane is right now.WATTERS: Al Roker is getting sued over DEI.Plus --JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: By the way, how do you think Uncle Bosie tasted?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Uncle who?WATTERS: There is an animal loose on the streets of New York City, breaking out of his cage at the crack of dawn this morning, Donald Trump, headed straight into a construction site.(PEOPLE chanting "USA.")WATTERS: Donald Trump amid a sea of hard hats this morning, it wasn't even 6:30. The former president shaking hands, signing hats, and talking to the people who built the city of New York.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think these may be were Democrats, but to me, they were Republicans.(PEOPLE chanting)TRUMP: There is not a Democrat in there. These are people.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).TRUMP: We've built a lot of great buildings in this city with these people, and they've given me great support. They are really amazing.You know what? They are very, very, very talented people. They don't get the credit for it. There are very few people who can do what they do. We used to do three floors a week in concrete. And it was guys like this that did it, so it's very great.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Trump has always loved a good construction site. For a real estate mogul like him, it is home. Judging by the "We love Trump" chants, they love him, too.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was great to see the president coming and engaging with the blue collar worker of New York City. We basically built New York.I put out a poll and my union. President Trump is leading Joe Biden three to one on my presidential poll out of my 9,000 members right now.We are very tired of the situation with groceries, inflation, gas prices, illegal immigration, crime. We are living it every day in New York City.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: These are lifelong Democrat unions wrapping their arms around Trump, a group Joe Biden won by 16 points last time, but Biden can't even put a hard hat on the right way. Remember? When he does talk to them, too, he talks down to them.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are actively trying to amend your Second Amendment right and take away our guns.JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You're full of (bleep).I did not. No, no. Shush. Shush.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Choose your fighter. This is exactly why Democrats need Trump trapped inside of his cage in court. Every time he escapes, whether it's a construction site or a bodega, as MSNBC said, it's a dangerous situation. He earns the hearts and minds of crowds and Biden loses his base.Trump says he is making a play for New York.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Normally, a Democrat will win New York. Biden is the worst president in history and we have some very bad people here. But we have the greatest people and they are right behind me.And they all want us to run and we're going to -- we're going to run very hard in New York.New York, we have a good chance of winning New York in my opinion, but we're going to give it a shot.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But after hanging out with a bunch of hard hats this morning, Animal Control caught the Donald and threw him back in his cage, the freezing cold courtroom in Manhattan, but that didn't break his spirit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Today was breathtaking in this room. You saw what went on, it was breathtaking and amazing testimony. This is a trial that should have never happened. This is a case that should have never been filed and it was really an incredible -- an incredible day.Open your eyes.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The former president hit two holes in one in court today. One in Manhattan, another in the Supreme Court.It was day seven in the case of the crime that Democrats still haven't named. The man who ran the "National Enquirer," Dave Pecker back on the stand. This time, the Trump team got a chance to cross examine him. It turns out, Democrat star witness caught and killed for a lot of people.Pecker admitted to catching and killing a story about Tiger Woods. He said he paid hundreds of thousands to catch and kill for Arnold Schwarzenegger when he ran for California governor, between 30 and 40 women. Oh gosh, Arnold.That's not just Republicans he was killing stories for. Pecker testified that he caught and killed for Obama's former right hand man, Rahm Emanuel. It turns out Rahm's brother, Ari Emanuel reached out to Pecker asking him to catch and kill his brother's affair.The tabloids are always catching and killing for Republicans and Democrats. Are we going to haul Rahm Emanuel and Arnold into court for something that happened years ago? Are we're going to bring the CIA and the Biden campaign in for catching and killing the laptop?Pecker also testified that the whole catch and kill operation was spearheaded by him and Cohen, not Trump. He said: "We didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or embarrass or hurt the campaign." When asked who's "we"? He said not Trump. It's Pecker and Cohen.So it was the star witnesses of the case that wanted to catch and kill to protect Trump. Not Trump, got it.All of this blows their whole case up. Right now, the only case they're trying to make is that Trump should be held in contempt for talking. The Biden donating judge held off from issuing a ruling on that today, but while Alvin Bragg's team is attacking free speech in New York, Jack Smith's team was trying to undo 234 years of presidential precedent in the Supreme Court arguing that presidents should be held criminally liable for actions they take in office.The judges, though, not convinced.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SAMUEL ALITO, US SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: There's the old saw about indicting a ham sandwich.MICHAEL DREEBEN, SPECIAL COUNSEL ATTORNEY: Yes, but I think --ALITO: You have had a lot of experience in the Justice Department, you come across a lot of cases where the US attorney or another federal prosecutor really wanted to indict a case on the grand jury, refused to do so.DREEBEN: There are such cases.ALITO: Like that -- no?DREEBEN: Yes. But I think that the other one --ALITO: Every once in a while there's an eclipse, too.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Justice Kavanaugh asked like, well, why wouldn't this create a vicious cycle of partisan presidential prosecutions and pardons?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRETT KAVANAUGH, US SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: The concern going forward is that the system will -- when former presidents are subject to prosecution in the history of Morrison versus Olson tells us it's not going to stop. It is going to -- it is going to cycle back and be used against the current president or the next president or and the next president and the next president after that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The president not having immunity just opens up a Pandora's Box. If Trump gets charged, does that mean Bill Clinton gets charged for bombing aspirin factories in Africa? Does Obama get charged for drone strike getting a US citizen? Can Biden be charged for human trafficking along the border? Cocaine possession? Or for his windmills murdering whales? I mean, they're endangered species. That's one year per whale.You take away a president's immunity and his free speech and there is no coming back. These are all legal Hail Marys to keep Trump chained inside of a cage away from the campaign trail and away from you, the voter. But good luck keeping him in his cage.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We are going to the South Bronx to go rally. We're going to be doing a rally at Madison Square Garden, we believe. We think we're setting Madison Square Garden to do. We're going to have a big crowd honoring the police and honoring the firemen, and everybody. We are honoring a lot of people, including teachers.We will be honoring the people that make New York work and we will be doing a number of large rallies. It'll be very exciting.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Jason Murray is a graduate apprentice with the steamfitters union.So Jason, you are out there today? What happened with the helmet?JASON MURRAY, GRADUATE APPRENTICE WITH THE STEAMFITTERS UNION: Yes. So I got to see Trump and I was there in the back and I asked, hey, Mr. President, could you please sign my welding helmet. I handed it over, the Service tried to deny it first.WATTERS: Oh yes?MURRAY: And then he was like, no, let me get that. So --WATTERS: You'll never wear that again.MURRAY: I can't. Can't. This one's going to go on the mantle at the home.WATTERS: So you've got to buy a new one.MURRAY: I do have to buy a new one and the funny part about this whole thing, my brothers in the -- he is in the Army. He is in Alaska right now. So it says Armed Forces. So when he got it and held it up, and I was just like, this is, you know, perfect right now.WATTERS: Well, that's great. And thank your brother for his service.MURRAY: Oh, thank you.WATTERS: So you heard the soundbite of your chief, he said that it's three to one, Trump to Biden. Was it always like that? Didn't the unions in Manhattan used to be more liberal?MURRAY: Yes. Just four years ago, you could even see there are union -- they have said to support Biden, and then immediately the week after he got into office and he took over, laid off 10,000 of our workers, some of my brothers.WATTERS: He laid them off.MURRAY: He laid them off, the job was gone.WATTERS: They were out working on the pipeline, shut down the pipeline. Now all of these guys that had jobs out there working, trying to provide for their family, now, they don't have a job anymore.WATTERS: He didn't really mention it. He just laid them off and that was it. No apology, no nothing.What else started to change that shifted your political leanings and the union towards Trump?MURRAY: Well, just the cost of living just going through the roof. Everything that they promised -- they say more work, they say all of this, and then all of a sudden, they turn around, all of these illegal immigrants coming in.I mean, Kathy Hochul, she was trying to give our work away. So it's like you say, the Democrats, you're here for the working man. Yet here, you're trying to give our jobs away to people that don't even have legal status here yet.WATTERS: When you reflect back to the Trump presidency, you've now been able to compare the four of Trump, about four of Biden, are you and your members thinking about that? Just looking at it back-to-back?MURRAY: Yes. I have conversations with guys on the job sites all the time and 2018 was one of the busiest times that any of us can remember in construction and that was during his presidency.WATTERS: So, it hasn't been as active with Joe Biden.MURRAY: No, not at all.WATTERS: When you see Trump, I guess, he is there at 6:30 in the morning, he is shaking hands, and he is getting back to his freezing cage in court. How does that make you guys feel?MURRAY: It's actually -- it is a great feeling and our business manager who is on TV, he reached out to every single presidential candidate, see if they wanted to address our membership and he got a response directly from Trump, directly from RFK and he has not received a single e-mail or memo from Biden or his team.WATTERS: Wow. Do you think President Trump is getting a fair trial here in Manhattan?MURRAY: I think it's a kangaroo court.WATTERS: All right.MURRAY: I think it's Banana Republic and it is a shame.WATTERS: All right, well, I'd sign that for you, but I think it would lower the value. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.MURRAY: I appreciate it.WATTERS: Thanks for your service.MURRAY: Thank you for having me.WATTERS: We'll see you around.MURRAY: Thank you.WATTERS: Hamas professors, gender seasons, and who ate Joe Biden's Uncle Bosie?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Arab Spring Break was lit this week. Radicals at USC swarmed police and blocked their squad cars from leaving the scene after arresting a bunch of wannabe Jihadis.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: These encampments are becoming more hostile by the day. When colleges are no go zones for CNN, that means trouble.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The atmosphere is getting a little rough tonight. People like this who won't show their face, but are trying to intimidate us by filming us.So the atmosphere is getting a little unpleasant now we've got to say.So earlier what happened, protesters started -- the guy is still filming me. I mean --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm just filming you -- what you're doing, dude.WATT: Yes. I mean --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are you scared?WATT: Yes, I mean, show your face. Show your face.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are you scared? Why are you scared?WATT: Why are you scared to show your face?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you support genocide? Is that what you support?WATT: Anyway, anyway, anyway.More than 50 of them were arrested --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you support genocide? Is that what you support?WATT: Anyways, I think we should -- I think -- I think, we should probably go because it's getting a little nasty here.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: But these Hamas influencers are starting to smell like Antifa. Outsiders aren't welcome in their encampments, which is why Ilhan Omar was welcomed to Columbia with open arms today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: What message are you sending today with the visit to the encampment?REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): I just wanted to see and make sure that what you know, that it is being -- that we were hearing from the young people that it is peaceful, that they want the issue to be focused on the demands that they are making. And that, you know, we should not conflate other things that are happening elsewhere to the encampments that are happening on college campuses.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Here's the thing: Those protests are happening on college campuses, whether the colleges want them or not. New York's renowned Fashion Institute of Technology, not traditionally a haven for political activism, tried to shut down a protest that was starting on their grounds, but outside reinforcements showed up and forced their way inside to support the budding encampment.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)WATTERS: Universities shouldn't be surprised by these insurgent cells popping up on their grounds, they've made fostering these anti -American ideas a key point of their curriculum. It's what attracted many of these students in the first place.Here's a clip from an anti-Israel seminar hosted by a Columbia Student group right before these protests kicked off.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On October 7th, we saw the potential of a future for Palestine, liberated from Zionism by the forces of the resistance.How do we get organized and use the organizing that we're doing in order to be a meaningful part of that global front of resistance?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think after October 7th, Palestinians have revived their revolution because they have now engaged in not just defending themselves and their existence, but also we are moving towards the being -- the taking initiatives.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Yes, Hamas was just showing initiative. That's what we like to see. And let's meet one of Columbia's now formerly esteemed professors, Muhammad Abduh. The school describes him as a Muslim anarchist interdisciplinary activist scholar of indigenous Black, Critical Race and Islamic Studies, as well as gender sexuality, abolition, and decolonization with extensive fieldwork experience.Here is one of the seminars Muhammad held before he was hired by Columbia.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MUHAMMAD ABDUH, PROFESSOR: It doesn't take mass mobilizations to change the world. Look what 1,500 warriors were able to do, to whatever extent that we agree or disagree or partially accept or whatever, Hamas or not, I have my own critiques, or whatever of Islamists in general, but ultimately, I support the resistance.But look what 1,500 people were able to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: All right, look what they were able to do? They slaughtered innocent women and raped their corpses. Columbia saw that and said "You're hired." They knew exactly what they were getting when they hired Muhammad, and now they're just trying to save face.Last week, the president of the University told Congress that Muhammad would never work in Columbia again. Okay. But Muhammad was reportedly seen on campus just a day ago, and said that the school's president lied about firing him.Once you let these people take root, it's almost impossible to weed them out. What's it going to take for Columbia to fire this guy? They find out he is unvaxxed.Charlie Hurt, joins me now.Charlie, CNN is broadcast from Afghanistan or Iraq, but they had to wrap things up at Columbia. What does that tell you?CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Actual war zones.WATTERS: War zones.HURT: They might have gotten under the desk, but they keep filming.WATTERS: Right.HURT: But not at Columbia University? No, it's really amazing and the degree to which Joe Biden owns all of this, lots of different reasons, not just because all of these are Democrat supporters. And of course, Joe Biden, you know, he is not condemning these people.What he is saying is, he is still kowtowing to them desperately trying to get their support for the next election. But this is the thing that I think is going to sear through worse than anything else. Because of Joe Biden, the American taxpayer is paying the tuition of these clowns to go to this university and these bills are being paid by people who work hard, who maybe didn't go to college themselves, who maybe couldn't send their own children to college, but they're having to pay for this stuff and it is enraging to a regular person.WATTERS: Right. When you see people wearing the headscarves, now, that could be a legitimate deal that they're doing, I get it, but it looks like they're hiding their faces purposely for disguise in order to cause trouble and not be seen.HURT: So you know, who's not confused about any of this stuff? Are regular Americans, regular taxpayers, they look at this stuff and they're disgusted. And as much as companies try to be woke and try to pretend like they would you sort of endure all of this nonsense, the truth is, companies are not going to hire these people.These clowns are never going to work. They're going to be on welfare the rest of their lives. And so the only smart thing some of these students are doing is putting on masks, hiding behind umbrellas and putting on scarves so that they can't -- so they don't wind up on LinkedIn.com.WATTERS: It's like Halloween.HURT: Right.WATTERS: Oh, I love the guy that says, you know, man, Hamas really showed some potential. Really good initiative.HURT: Yes. Yes, no.WATTERS: They hired that guy.HURT: And course, this guy, Professor Abduh, who's an expert in, among other things, sexuality, hired literally three months to the day after October 7th, which he celebrated and they hired him.I don't care that they fired him. They hired him in the first place.WATTERS: Right.HURT: And that's the problem.WATTERS: And then they lied about firing him.HURT: Yes.WATTERS: You can't fire that guy.HURT: Yes.WATTERS: It is impossible now.All right, Charlie, Thanks so much.HURT: Good to see you.WATTERS: Kamala's Secret Service agent who wigged out, new details. Could be a DEI hire.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: As Democrats hold Donald Trump hostage in a freezing New York show trial, the former president is getting a front row seat to see the liberal policies destroying society.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: He makes Jimmy Carter look great. Jimmy Carter is very happy because his presidency was brilliant by comparison, but this is the worst president we've ever had.He is destroying our country. Close the borders, he can do it in one phone call, he can close the borders. Close up the borders, Joe. Our country is going to hell.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: America agrees. A majority of the country backs mass deportations of illegals, but sanctuary cities like Chicago, doing everything they can to make sure the migrants keep showing up.Chicago City Council approving a massive $70 million pay day for illegal aliens and that is on top of the $150 million already earmarked. Where's the money going? Free hotels and houses.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(NICK SHIRLEY AND UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.)TRANSLATED CONVERSATIONNICK SHIRLEY, INDEPENDENT JOURNALIST: And how long have you been in this hotel?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Seven months.SHIRLEY: How was the service inside?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was good because they help us move forward to get a house.SHIRLEY: Was the baby born here?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.SHIRLEY: Is the government giving you money to go to a house?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.SHIRLEY: How much?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't remember how much, but I have to leave now.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: The Chicago illegal aliens are very thankful and they know they wouldn't be here if it wasn't for one man.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Thanks to the North American President Joe Biden, we are all North American.UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Since we've arrived, he has treated us good. We are thankful for his support and we love him.UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): If I could vote, I would vote for Biden.SHIRLEY (through translator): Are you going to be able to vote in the elections?UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): My dream is to vote. Get my document to vote, that is my dream. They give us the opportunity to vote, Joe Biden is number one.SHIRLEY (through translator): Are the migrants afraid if Donald Trump wins the election?UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Yes, the truth is yes. Yes, there is fear.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Biden might be down in the polls, but he's got a hundred percent approval rating with illegals. The people who grew up in Chicago, the American citizens are getting shafted, and they're not happy about it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are treating them better than real residents, like they are giving give them (bleep) that they don't give us and we are born and raised in Chicago.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Taking care of migrants more than the actual residents of the city. We are trying to get them out of our city to be honest with you.There have been like robbing and stealing phones, they are robbing people and stuff like that.SHIRLEY: There are a lot of crime from the migrants here?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, of course, definitely. You know, they are stealing and robbing. But the difference between the citizens in Chicago is no accountability for the migrants.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: It takes a lot for Chicago to complain about crime. Meanwhile, the migrant crisis is crushing average Americans, big business sees this surge with dollar signs in their eyesThe Bezos' "Washington Post" just came out and admitted what we've known all along. Biden's half-baked jobs claims have really only benefited one group, illegals. They published a handy chart showing that if it weren't for foreign-born workers, there'd be zero job growth since 2020. Zero. Flat.Bezos' paper sees no problem there. In fact, they're celebrating Biden's open borders without mentioning the deadly crime wave that's been ushered in. To them Laken Riley is just the cost of doing business.The migrant home invader who raped two kids in Michigan, still an economic net positive. Democrats have already admitted they want him to pick crops, hold mops, and wipe down tabletops.PRIMETIME is learning more about the Secret Service agent who went on a wild rampage at Fort Base Andrews this week. She was supposed to be protecting Kamala, but other agents ended up needing protection from her.Secret Service Sources tell RealClearPolitics, the agent was acting weird from the get-go, but things took a turn when she snatched a senior agent's phone and starts deleting his apps. He got it back, but things got worse.She reportedly started mumbling to herself and throwing tampons at another agent, while screaming that they're going to burn in hell. They told her she was being removed from the assignment and then it got worse from there.She then chest bumped the commanding officer, tackled him to the ground, and started swinging. She was armed the whole time, by the way.She was taken away in cuffs, and it turns out this wasn't her first issue with a superior. In 2016, she sued the city of Dallas where she was a cop. She felt retaliated against after she blew the whistle over an alleged sexual assault. She wanted a million bucks, but the judge dismissed the case, twice.So how did this woman get on the VP detail? Some agents pointing to DEI. The Secret Service pledged to make women 30 percent of the force by 2030.Let's ask Ronald Kessler, author of "The First Family Detail." What do you think really happened here, Ron?RONALD KESSLER, AUTHOR, "THE FIRST FAMILY DETAIL": I think you laid it out perfectly.The Secret Service namely the Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle decided to embrace this goal put out by a women's police organization to have 30 percent of the agents in the case of the Secret Service be females, and that's roughly doubling the percentage of females in the Secret Service.Well, of course, what does that lead to? That leads to corner cutting, accepting people who are not up to standards, and sure enough, in this case, you had the Secret Service overlooking an obvious problem, which was the loss you imagine, where the judge twice dismissed the charges, wouldn't even bring it to trial because obviously, there was no evidence and that calls into question her judgment and her honesty.So that immediately should have been a red flag. She never should have been hired. And it's so serious, you know, she just could have just as well could have attacked Kamala Harris.WATTERS: I mean, it could have gotten a lot worse. You're right. And this woman, Cheatle, who is running the Secret Service, this is the same woman that hired this woman. This is the same woman that kind of covered up the cocaine in the White House, isn't she?KESSLER: Well, I don't know about that, but you know, I think that's still up for grabs and I don't see an indication there, but you are right that is a problem because she ignored the fact that 24 times, Biden's dog had bitten Secret Service agents over a period of almost a year.Now, I understand that she did talk to Biden about it, Bidens blamed the agents, which is typical Biden. You know, he blames the supermarkets for inflation, but she should have said -- she should have stood up to him and said, you know, we cannot provide protection to you if we're going to be under constant threat. That's what she should have done and she never did.WATTERS: All right, Ronald Kessler, "The First Family Detail," go get the book.Thanks so much, Ron. Have a great weekend.KESSLER: Thank you, Jesse.WATTERS: Fox News Alert: Harvey Weinstein's rape conviction in New York has just been overturned. How? Senior national correspondent, Kevin Corke has the story -- Kevin.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Jesse, as shocking as it sounds, the Weinstein decision actually makes it likely that a brand new trial in New York and the very same charges will come about in the not too distant future. However, and this is important. Mr. Weinstein will remain behind bars, both because of a separate conviction and because of what would likely turn into a lengthy retrial.Meantime, here's what happened today. New York State Court of Appeals overturned Weinstein's 23-year sentence and a four-three decision. The court found that the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against Weinstein, based on allegations that were not a part of the case.#MeToo advocates noted that the ruling was based on legal technicalities and is not an exoneration of Mr. Weinstein's behavior. In a stinging dissent, Judge Madeline Singas wrote that the Court of Appeals was continuing a disturbing trend of overturning juries' guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence, adding that the ruling came at the expense and safety of women.Now Weinstein's lawyers expect today's ruling to have a major impact on his appeal of his LA rape conviction for which he is on the hook for 16 years. Their arguments, Jesse, are set to begin on May the 20th.Back to you.WATTERS: All right, Kevin, thank you so much.CORKE: You bet.WATTERS: Johnny checks in with Biden voters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELISARIO: Do you think Joe Biden is okay up there?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Biden hasn't done a lot, but he doesn't like you know (bleep) anything up yet.BELISARIO: Except for the economy, the border.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Okay, so, okay.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: We'll be doing this on a weekly basis.

I love summer so much I'm thinking of identifying as it. It's called gender season.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you know however there is a gender identity that is linked to the seasons, this is called gender season.Gender season is an individual who explores the gender identity in relation to a season or all the seasons. So this might be somebody whose gender expression and identity is linked to one season. So for example, winter, or this might be somebody whose gender identity and expression changes depending on the season.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: My pronoun, spring, but I might transition to summer.Working in retail is hard.

The rules are supposed to change in August. Boys' and girls' locker rooms, boys in the field hockey team, boys in the girls bathroom. And remember, that can be changing based on the seasons, but not in Florida.Ron DeSantis says no changes will be made to Title 9 in his state for as long as he's governor and you can expect the Biden administration to sue which can take this to the Supreme Court where we may get some clarity on the trans situation.When the President of the United States says his uncle was eaten by cannibals, naturally, you'd think it would be covered everywhere.
