Link to ImageFormer President Donald Trump unveiled his latest message on abortion on Monday  Predictably, it set in motion the left screaming that he was not pro-abortion enough and the right screaming that he was too pro-abortion  It didn't have to be this way, as former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy showed At the start of this, it is important to acknowledge abortion for what it is- the sanctioned murder of an innocent life  Anyone who says differently is coping with past sins or has no regard for the dignity of human life because without abortion, that unborn baby would be alive  WATCH: Trump releases new statement on abortion policy, saying abortion restrictions should be left to states  Do you agree? pic twitter com/hCv13xgt1h - Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) April 8, 2024Trump posted his abortion message on his social media site, Truth Social “My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land in this case, the law of the state,” Trump said  “Many states will be different  Many will have a different number of weeks, or some will have more conservative than others, and that's what they will be  At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people ” (ROOKE: Cry About Abortion All You Want, But Know Conservatives Are To Blame)He made this statement for seemingly no reason at all  While it was pegged to the Alabama legislature's recent bill regarding in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments, he had no obligation to speak about it  He should have just not said anything  Doesn't he understand he is winning in the polls because the economy and illegal immigration are so bad no one cares about social issues?The left wants nothing more than to have voters focused on abortion rather than the failing economy and the open border  They can't win on these issues, but they know how evil our nation has become and want nothing more than to rile up their base with the potential loss of their baby-murdering ways  Whoever told Trump it was a good idea to make a message on abortion wants him to fail in November President Joe Biden has already released a stream of posts on Twitter about Trump being against abortion, and the Democrat base will eat it up with a spoon while they forget about not being able to afford their rent  Trump's message on abortion does nothing but help Democrats kill more innocent lives  This is a painful story that so many families around America now know too well: Amanda was denied the medical care she needed, and it nearly took her life  More than 1 in 3 women in America now lives under an abortion ban, with more on the way  Donald Trump did this  pic twitter com/2vH8EdzIw8 - Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) April 8, 2024There is no sense in making a compromise on which week a baby can be killed by abortion, as Ramaswamy said many times on the campaign trail  His comments on abortion never capitulated to the left by using their language  He spoke freely about being unapologetically pro-life in every sense of the word, demanding more access to crisis pregnancy centers in order to help women who would otherwise turn to abortion because they felt they had no other option  He spoke about creating easier pathways for adoption and ending taxpayer money going to fund abortion mills like Planned Parenthood  (ROOKE: Conservative Men - Focus On Finding A Good Wife, Not A 'Trad Wife')Of course, Trump was right when he said we “must win elections to restore our culture ” If Trump had to say anything at all, it should have been this  Instead, he created a video talking about ending Roe V  Wade, which failed to score him any points with progressives and angered his base  Duh  It was never going to work  He should fire the person who keeps telling him to bow to progressives who hate him  Nothing he says will ever work to appease the left  Trump did this  pic twitter com/ydz1aFxEDD - Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) April 9, 2024Justifying the practice of abortion by whether it's legal or the “will of the people” does nothing to negate the harsh realities behind its brutality  Since the beginning of time, humans have committed horrific crimes against others  Even American indigenous tribes committed demonic human sacrifices wildly supported by their people  If the will of the people is evil, then the people's will needs to be changed The only way to change Americans' views on abortion is by ending the left's chokehold on our nation's institutions  And the only way to do that is by winning elections  It's no shock that every woman walking on the street will scream about their supposed constitutional right to kill their baby when the schools that educated them, the doctors that provide their healthcare, and their favorite celebrities all tell them that without access to abortion, women will become subhuman  Without the ability to end their legacies, women will be destined to be dystopian baby factories that will never climb the corporate ladder or win an award for artistic excellence  They must have abortions, or their lives are at risk  (ROOKE: Biden Looks To Deal Fatal Blow To Girls' Sports)Our nation is without morality  It doesn't understand anymore what our forefathers fought to give us  But we cannot teach these truths and save our country from a death spiral of human sacrifice if we can't win an election as easy as the November 2024 race should be
