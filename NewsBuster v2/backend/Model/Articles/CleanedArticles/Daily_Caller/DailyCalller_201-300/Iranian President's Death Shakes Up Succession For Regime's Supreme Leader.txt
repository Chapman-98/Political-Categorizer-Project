Khamenei's second son, Mojtaba Khamenei - may have a clearer shot at the role Mojtaba, a cleric and theology teacher, does not share the same public notoriety as his father and is not an official within the Iranian regime, according to Iran International and NYT  But he is said to have considerable political influence behind closed doors, aiding senior officials in dictating policy, and has close ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) and its respective Basij paramilitary forces, the latter of which he is believed to be its de facto leader  (RELATED: Princeton Tried To Bridge The US-Iran Gap -
