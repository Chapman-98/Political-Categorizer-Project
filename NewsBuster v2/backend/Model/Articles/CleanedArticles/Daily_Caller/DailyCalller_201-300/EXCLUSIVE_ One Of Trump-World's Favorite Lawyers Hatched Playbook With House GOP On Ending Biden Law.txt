back against President Joe Biden's lawfare against Trump, the Daily Caller has learned Davis, founder and president of the Article III Project, met with lawmakers from the House Conservative Opportunity Society, which is chaired by Republican South Carolina Rep  Ralph Norman  The group does not share how many members it has or when it holds meetings, which are off the record with no staff or media present Davis was asked to speak to the group about Trump's ongoing legal battles and ways House Republicans can help the former President from Congress  Davis told the Caller that there were over a dozen members present for the meeting, which took place the morning of May 1 at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington D C “I want to maintain the privacy of the discussions the members of COS had with Mr  Davis, but I can say it was a productive meeting,” Norman told the Caller  “On the matter of why House Republicans are rallying around President Trump, I see it as a very simple choice  This race is between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, that's an easy decision for me and many of my colleagues  It's a decision between how we've been living under the Biden admin the past 3 years versus the freedoms we had under the Trump admin ”“Between the inflated prices we've seen recently versus four years ago  Between crime-riddled cities and illegal immigrants running rampant versus a secure border and safer cities  Republicans can see the stark difference between what these two administrations provided for the American people and are choosing to side with President Trump,” he added Link

members attended the meeting, but said that the group is eager to fight for Trump “There were quite a few House Republicans and I briefed them in detail about the Biden Democrats' lawfare and election interference  [I] equipped them with information and motivation to fight back  I called them the 'tip of the spear in the House' for the counter offensive in Biden's lawfare against Trump,” Davis said

Rep  Tim Burchett confirmed to the Caller he attended the meeting, and said Davis did a great job explaining how one-sided the cases are against Trump “Mike is a smart guy with solid conservative values  When he spoke to us about these lawfare issues, he laid out a very clear and concise argument for why the justice system is against President Trump and how the cards are stacked against him,” Burchett told the Caller Illinois Republican Rep  Mary Miller was also in the room, the Caller confirmed  She claimed the Biden DOJ is silencing political opponents that Davis is key to fighting back “Mike Davis's passion to fight and to hold corrupt left-wing judges accountable for their unconstitutional actions comes at a critical time when Joe Biden's Department of Justice is attempting to silence Biden's political opponents,” Miller said  “The Left is weaponizing the judicial system, and Mike is fighting to preserve the freedoms our Constitutional Republic guarantees the American taxpayer ”Arizona Republican Rep  Andy Biggs also confirmed he was in the meeting, saying he is grateful for Norman and the Conservative Opportunity Society for hosting Davis and slamming the prosecution of Trump “The hyperpolitical lawfare being waged against President Trump stands opposed to everything that America was founded on  House Republicans should not remain silent in the face of such blatant partisan prosecution  We ought to use the tools the Constitution has given us to check the Biden regime's attack on President Trump and conservatives across the country  I am thankful to Chairman Norman and the Conservative Opportunity Society for hosting Mr  Davis to discuss such a crucial topic,” Biggs told the Caller Davis went on to say that the main goal was to help pressure House leadership to do everything in their power to defend Trump Link to ImageFormer US President Donald Trump, with his lawyer Susan Necheles (R), returns after a break in his trial for allegedly

Committee, including the weaponization subcommittee, and so far it hasn't been,” Davis said  “The point of this meeting with the Conservative Opportunity Society was to get these most bold and fearless House members, to get the House Judiciary Committee, including the weaponization Committee, to step up and do their jobs,” Davis added
