He was talking about the importance about being a country of immigrants, especially as you see the attacks that we have seen very recently in the last couple of years, on those attacks on immigrants in particular  And so it is important for us to remember that we are a country of immigrants,” Jean-Pierre began “I'm explaining what he was talking about and how he was - what he was focusing on in those comments - country of immigrants, it makes us stronger and it is important to be very clear about that  And the president's always going to be really clear on speaking on issues that matter to the American people  We are a country of immigrants  That matters  And we've seen these attacks and so the president is never going to shy away from that ”Through several questions about the president's remarks about Japan, Jean-Pierre maintained that Biden was speaking to the United States' strengths and the fact that America is a “nation of immigrants ”“This election is about freedom, America and democracy  That's why I badly need you  You know, one of the reasons why our economy is growing is because of you and many others  Why? Because we welcome immigrants,” Biden said at the campaign event  (RELATED: Biden Says States Shouldn't Deploy National Guard Against Anti-Israel Protests)“We look to - the reason - look, think about it  Why is China stalling so badly economically? Why is Japan having trouble? Why is Russia? Why is India? Because they're xenophobic  They don't want immigrants  Immigrants is what makes us strong  Not a joke  That's not hyperbole  Because we have an influx of workers who want to be here and want to contribute,” the president continued Jean-Pierre did not answer whether Biden wanted to apologize to Japan over the comments “Was that intentional? And does the president want to apologize to Japan?” a reporter asked “The broader case that he was trying to make, which I think most leaders and allies across the globe understand, is he was saying that when it comes to, when it comes to, when it comes to who we are as a nation, we are a nation of immigrants  That is in our DNA  And you've heard the president say this, and you've heard us say it more as an administration, it makes us better  We are stronger for it  Because of the fact that in our DNA, we are a nation of immigrants, and I think that is probably very important to note as well ”
