Link to ImageA key California congressional primary is heading for a recount after two candidates tied for second place and one Democratic candidate's campaign isn't happy about it, Politico reported Tuesday The jungle primary election - where candidates of all parties compete on the same ballot for the top two spots, to advance to the general election - in California's 16th Congressional District produced a second-place tie between Democratic Assemblyman Evan Low of Campbell and Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Smitian, who each gained 30,249 votes  The race will head to a recount after a former employee of the first-place candidate, former Democratic Mayor Sam Liccardo of San José, filed a request to do so, an act that was blasted by Low's campaign, Politico reported  (RELATED: Two Candidates Tied In California Congressional Primary)“This is a page right out of Trump's political playbook using dirty tricks to attack democracy and subvert the will of the voters,” a spokesperson for Low told Politico  “[Liccardo] did not file a recount himself  Instead, he had his former staffer do it for him  What's he afraid of?”#CD16 Update 21 13% - 38,489 - Sam Liccardo (D) 16 61% - 30,249 - Evan Low (D) pic twitter com/07Q0Et6LT6 - CATargetBot0001 (@CATargetBot0001) April 3, 2024Unlike Low, Smitian did not publicly criticize the recount  “Eventually, this process will work itself out     My job is to stay focused on how I can best represent the folks in our district  And that's what I'm doing,” he wrote in a statement to Politico A recount may change the tally of votes for either Smitian or Low, which would prevent both of them from advancing to the runoff election in November  Liccardo's campaign, which received 8,240 votes more than Low and Smitian, denied to Politico that it was involved in the effort to force a recount but supported the measure “Every vote should be counted, and that's why recounts are part of the state's electoral process to ensure accuracy,” wrote a spokesperson for Liccardo to Politico  “We understand why, under these extraordinary circumstances, there would be an effort to make sure these votes are fully considered ”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience  All republished articles must include our logo, our reporter's byline and their DCNF affiliation  For any questions about our guidelines or partnering with us, please contact licensing@dailycallernewsfoundation org
