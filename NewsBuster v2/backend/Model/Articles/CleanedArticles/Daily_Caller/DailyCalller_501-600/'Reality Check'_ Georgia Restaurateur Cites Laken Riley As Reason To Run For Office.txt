How many people have we welcomed into our community and who are they?”Residents shouted down Girtz at a press conference following Riley's death, during which the Athens mayor tried to deny that his city has sanctuary city policies  Girtz also criticized former President Donald Trump at the press conference despite the surge of illegal migrants entering the United States under the Biden administration  There were over 2 4 million migrant encounters in fiscal year 2023 alone, up from roughly 2 3 million in fiscal year 2022 and 1 7 million in fiscal year 2021, according to federal data
