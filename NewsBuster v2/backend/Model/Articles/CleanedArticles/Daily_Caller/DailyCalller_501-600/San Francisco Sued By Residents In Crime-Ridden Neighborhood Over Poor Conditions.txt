The city currently faces lawsuits on both sides of the issue, with the Coalition on Homelessness, a nonprofit assisting the homeless in the city, arguing the city has been cruel in their application of homeless ordinances, and the University of California (UC) College of the Law, San Francisco, arguing that the city has been too lax.
