I believe there is nothing more pro-life than helping families have children, and I do not support federal restrictions on IVF. - Rep. Michelle Steel (@RepSteel) February 22, 2024The ruling followed a case where three couples attempted to sue a hospital for wrongful death after alleging that a patient at the hospital destroyed their frozen embryos.On Wednesday, the University of Alabama at Birmingham stated they would pause IVF treatment at their Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility as they evaluate the Supreme Court decision due to concerns about potential legal ramificationsSimilar concerns following the ruling have led many other fertility clinics in Alabama to cease their IVF treatments.“We should do everything we can to protect IVF for women everywhere,” Mace told Axio.
