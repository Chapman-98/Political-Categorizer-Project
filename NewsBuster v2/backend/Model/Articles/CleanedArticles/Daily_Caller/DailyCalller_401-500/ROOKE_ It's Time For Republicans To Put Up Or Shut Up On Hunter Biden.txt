he was an enabler, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability,” Bobulinski testified to the House Oversight and Accountability Committee in Feb “The only reason any of these international business transactions took place, with tens of millions of dollars flowing directly to the Biden family, was because Joe Biden was in high office  The Biden family business was Joe Biden, period,” he said Bobulinski even addressed any defense that Hunter Biden only invoked his father's name because he was struggling with a drug addiction  He said in those meetings, the men involved knew Joe Biden was the key to getting the deals done, and when Joe Biden met him in person, he acknowledged the work Bobulinski was doing with the Biden family and the CCP  (ROOKE: Dems Suddenly Decide To Care About Witness Credibility) Joe Biden repeatedly said that his family never made a dime from China, but Hunter, Jim, and the Big Guy himself all received a cut from the deal with CEFC China Energy  It's abundantly clear that the only service the Biden family ever provided was their ability to leverage the    pic twitter com/tEZ1yYA3R1 - Rep  Jake LaTurner (@RepLaTurner) March 21, 2024“And earlier this morning when I read Rob Walker's testimony, and he tries to obfuscate, like, 'Whoa, Hunter Biden was on drugs, that's why he was invoking his father,' or stuff like that, it's just so absurd  I met Joe Biden face-to-face  These guys were talking about having Joe Biden come to New York and sit face-to-face with Chairman Ye while we were formalizing this deal  And for every one of these guys to now have amnesia or, like, you know, claim that, 'Oh, Hunter wasn't really talking about his father' is just absurd  The American people deserve the truth,” Bobulinski stated What will it take for Republicans to see that justice is done here? The American people are watching a two-tiered justice system favor a powerful family while everyday citizens are held to the letter of the law If the president was in business with the CCP, shouldn't Republicans in Congress use their power to act? How many spy balloons get to travel across the American midwest eerily close to sensitive weapons facilities and military bases before someone steps in to protect the country?Apparently, it's too much to ask for Republicans to do anything more than their 5 minutes on primetime television
