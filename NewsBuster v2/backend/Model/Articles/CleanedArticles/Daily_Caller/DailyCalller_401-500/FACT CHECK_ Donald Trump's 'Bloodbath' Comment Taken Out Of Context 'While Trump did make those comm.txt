MAGA2024,” Trump's post partially reads The Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote in a March 17 opinion piece that “The press and Democrats jumped on the remarks as if Mr  Trump was inciting violence if he loses ”“No doubt his words were over the top, as they often are  But his 'bloodbath' context was clearly the U S  car industry, and suggesting more than that plays into Mr  Trump's hands by giving voters one more reason not to trust media reporting about him,” the editorial board wrote Check Your Fact reached out to the Trump campaign for comment  (RELATED: Fact Checking Biden's Recent Claims About Wage Growth, Inflation)
