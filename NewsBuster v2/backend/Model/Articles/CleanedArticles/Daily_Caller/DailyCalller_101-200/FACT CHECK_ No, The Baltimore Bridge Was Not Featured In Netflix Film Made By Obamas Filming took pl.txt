Link to ImageA post shared on Facebook claims the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland was featured in the Netflix film “Leave the World Behind” produced by former First Lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama  Verdict: FalseThe bridge did not appear in this movie  Filming took place in New York, not Baltimore, according to the Netflix website Fact Check:The owners and managers of the cargo ship Dali deny any responsibility after the vessel lost power and struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge, according to New York Post  Six construction workers were killed after the collision sent the bridge tumbling into the water, the outlet reported  A Facebook post claims the bridge was featured in Netflix film “Leave the World Behind ” An image appears to show a person looking out of a window that shows the bridge's destruction “For those of you that don't know     The Francis Scott Key bridge is the same bridge that was shown in the Netflix movie 'Leave the World Behind,'” the caption reads  “The production company is owned by the Obamas  Open your eyes people ” (RELATED: No, Mitch Mcconnell's Sister-In-Law Was Not Ceo Of Shipping Company That Hit Baltimore Bridge)It is true that the Obamas own Higher Ground, one of the movie's production companies, and both are credited as executive producers on the film's IMDB page  There is no evidence the bridge made an appearance in the movie, however  It was filmed in New York, not Baltimore, according to the Netflix website  Additionally, the photo seen in the post appears to originate from stock image website Freepik  Instead of showing a view of the bridge in the window, it shows a city skyline  Conspiracy theories regarding a connection between the bridge collapse and the Obamas are likely due to a scene in the movie in which an oil tanker runs ashore on the Long Island coast, according to BBC journalist Shayan Sardarizadeh  Bizarre conspiracy theories suggest Barack and Michelle Obama may have been involved in the Baltimore Bridge collapse  Why? Because they were executive producers of the 2023 film Leave the World Behind, where in one scene, an oil tanker runs ashore  pic twitter com/4RCBp0M60N - Shayan Sardarizadeh (@Shayan86) March 26, 2024
