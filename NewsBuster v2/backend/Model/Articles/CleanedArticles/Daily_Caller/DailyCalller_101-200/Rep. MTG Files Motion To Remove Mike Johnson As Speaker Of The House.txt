Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion Friday morning for Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to vacate the chair.Greene called on Johnson to not bring the $1.2 trillion spending bill to the floor for a vote, calling it “a Chuck Schumer, Democrat-controlled bill coming from the 'Republican-controlled' House.” She would have to be recognized to try to vacate the speakership, and the House would have to take action within two legislative days. Having not noticed the privilege, the motion cannot be considered until after the recess.WATCH:  No Republican in good conscience can vote for the uniparty minibus. This is not a Republican bill.
