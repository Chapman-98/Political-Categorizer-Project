Link to ImageFormer President Donald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., had an unexpected surprise Monday after he was sent a letter containing white powder and a note with a death threat, causing a hazmat unit and firefighters to arrive at his Florida home.“It's just become a little bit too commonplace that this sort of stuff happens,” Donald Trump Jr. told the Daily Caller. “Clearly, if this happened to a prominent Democrat it wouldn't be tolerated and would drive news coverage for weeks. The media would blame all Republicans and force them to answer for it, But since it's me, radical haters on the left will largely get a free pass and the media will barely flinch.”“It doesn't matter what your politics are, this type of crap is unacceptable,” Donald Trumpl Jr. continued. “This is actually the second white powder substance envelope that's been mailed to me. The last time we had this happen, it was during my father's presidency and my then-wife opened it up with my kids by her side. So, it's just sad that we live in a society where politics and the left's hatred of my father would drive people to do such crazy things, but that's where we are unfortunately. ”EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS OBTAINED BY THE DAILY CALLER HERE: Link to ImageLink to Image(DAILY CALLER OBTAINED/HENRY RODGRS/DONALD TRUMP JR.)Link to Image(DAILY CALLER OBTAINED/DONALD TRUMP JR./HENRY RODGERS)Link to Image(DAILY CALLER OBTAINED/DONALD TRUMP JR./HENRY RODGERS)(RELATED: EXCLUSIVE PREVIEW: Trump To Detail America First Agenda In CPAC Speech)(RELATED: 'Well Received': Trump Details Supreme Court Challenge Over Colorado 14th Amendment Ballot Case In Mar-A-Lago Remarks)(RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Rips RNC, Says They Have To Stop Debates)(THIS IS A DEVELOPING STORY AND WILL BE UPDATED AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.)
