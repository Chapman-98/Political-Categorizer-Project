WASHINGTON — global race make next-generation computer chips reached Nebraska — dozens states, too  coming months, government plans start doling $50 billion semiconductor manufacturing research part CHIPS Science Act signed law last year  prospect much cash sparked scramble among states pitch best place spark semiconductor boom  CHIPS legislation designed help bolster America’s supply chain came production computer chips used everything coffee makers cars pacemakers missiles  measure primarily centered addressing national economic security concerns lack domestic manufacturing, presents windfall opportunity state local governments  dozen states begun pulling together incentive packages tax credits, zoning changes cuts regulatory red tape lure limited number companies looking expand chip production U S  scrambling, according data Semiconductor Industry Association interviews industry leaders officials  “We haven’t kind economic potential since corn,” said Nebraska state Sen  Mike McDonnell, introduced legislation smooth way chip makers looking expand state  “It’s big idea it’s something really help change state Nebraska ” President Joe Biden tours IBM facility Poughkeepsie, N

came stark relief pandemic Covid shutdowns supply chain disruptions caused worldwide shortage chips, leading shortages appliances, cars manufacturing equipment  Adding urgency increased tensions U S  China concerns China could moving toward annexing Taiwan, potentially putting U S  chip supply jeopardy  anticipation federal funds, semiconductor companies already making billions dollars commitments  Since bill introduced spring 2020, companies announced plans $187 billion new expanded semiconductor facilities 16 states would create 30,000 jobs, according Semiconductor Industry Association

hyperbole say it’s unprecedented historic,” said Dan Berglund, head State Science Technology Institute, influx federal state funds expand manufacturing  “Between CHIPS Act bills Congress passed last session, really opportunity completely restructure reshape face American manufacturing ” Competing next big deal, state officials proposing cut taxes ease regulations touting everything electric grid reliable weather effort lure chipmakers  Michigan, officials hoping use auto industry highly skilled manufacturing workforce advantage  state also tried promote weather advantage, since despite cold winters, state largely isolated extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods wildfires  state already seen boom facilities make chip-reliant electric vehicles batteries, driven part separate legislation last year offered incentives electric vehicle production  “This like nothing I’ve ever seen before,” said Quentin Messer, head Michigan Economic Development Corporation  “Once upon time, got $1 billion opportunity, felt like ‘Wow, may ever see ever again ’ pipeline 20-plus projects least $1 billion ” Kansas, officials "locked loaded" series proposals federal dollars soon application process opens, according Paul Hughes, deputy secretary business development Kansas Commerce Department  said state officials talking companies Biden administration months sharpen pitch, focused end-stage chip production aerospace defense-related industries  competition dollars fierce, number states spent years laying groundwork become semiconductor hub  moving Kansas, Hughes worked efforts Arizona convince world's biggest chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, open $40 billion facility there, something company announced last year  said types opportunities slim expectations states may whack  "It gets competitive fast, it'll interesting see states fare," Hughes said  "You definitely get try, good number probably little overzealous, perhaps expectations quite alignment reality " Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co  facility construction Phoenix, Dec  6, 2022  Caitlin O'Hara / Bloomberg via Getty Images New York state officials spent year constant talks semiconductor company Micron selected last October site $20 billion semiconductor campus near Syracuse  Officials hoping project, could grow much $100 billion, transform face region, restoring former cutting-edge manufacturing glory  New York's pitch Micron touted everything large number engineers graduating schools within two-hour radius Syracuse region's power grid, since Micron would access power coming four different regions state, including carbon-free power hydro nuclear plants  "There sentiment Syracuse miss piece second industrial revolution technology wave  missed it, many communities missed pieces goal obviously figure reconnect that," said Rob Simpson, CEO CenterState Corporation Economic Opportunity, represents region's business community  Along competition among other, states also compete global market  Europe working semiconductor program tune 43 billion Euros, China reportedly considering whether offer subsidies worth $100 billion maintain semiconductor industry  scaling U S  semiconductor industry matter years rather decades rife challenges, said industry leaders  country lacks workforce engineers highly specialized manufacturing workers run facilities, paying workers make building operating plant U S  expensive Asia — even government grants tax breaks  time, technology companies seeing slowdown demand past year, causing lay workers look ways cut costs, said Thomas Sonderman, CEO Minnesota-based semiconductor company SkyWater Technology  “There 'made America' premium people going comfortable with, end it’s economics,” Sonderman said  “The bill passed major upswing semiconductor sector  sector going correction time CHIPS going implemented, many ways, certain companies, sense urgency maybe reduced ” SkyWater Technology chose Indiana new $1 8 billion facility access workforce training programs Purdue University ease business state, said Sonderman  Indiana among states aggressively courting chipmakers, Gov  Eric Holcomb state economic development leaders traveling Taiwan last August pitch state computer chip electric vehicle battery makers  Midwest isn’t known semiconductor hot spot doesn’t established workforce, Sonderman says sees states advantage apparent hunger miss next manufacturing boom  “The ones thinking differently, hungry eager nimble able move quickly, think going ones take advantage CHIPS unique way,” said
