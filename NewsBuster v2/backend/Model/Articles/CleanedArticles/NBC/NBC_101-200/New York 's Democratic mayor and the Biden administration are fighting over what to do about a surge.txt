“We’ve saying since last year: need federal government allow asylum-seekers work, provide families,” said Thursday. won’t federal government fast-track work authorization tens thousands asylum-seekers New York City’s shelter system? Two senior Department Homeland Security officials told NBC News administration’s hands tied rule requires asylum-seekers wait 180 days applying work authorization. officials said would take act Congress change law. Adams administration proposed another solution problem: Granting Temporary Protected Status certain nationalities, Venezuelans, would let apply work permits instantly. “We calling White House, United States Department Homeland Security ensure newest Americans work lawfully build stable lives country. leaders Washington must redesignate extend Temporary Protected Status, also known TPS,” Adams said news conference May. “And want included Venezuela, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Sudan, South Sudan, Cameroon nations. Given continuing worsening humanitarian crisis countries, going pursue stability country offer.” two Homeland Security officials said it’s easy. Biden administration previously made Temporary Protected Status available Venezuelans already living March 2021. Venezuelans living streets New York's shelters crossed U.S.-Mexico border recently eligible. former Homeland Security official said agency reluctant grant Temporary Protected Status Venezuelans nationalities unless new crises home countries would justify making recent arrivals U.S. eligible. “There concern granting TPS one nationality spur others country come here,” said one former Homeland Security official. “The concern word get out, even misinformation, others think work live here.” Adams also said U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services, agency within Department Homeland Security, speed processing time approve work permits migrants apply. spokesperson USCIS said agency’s processing time asylum-based work authorizations less two months fiscal year. Another challenge, Homeland Security officials said, many migrants streets New York entered country illegally without detection, actually seeking asylum U.S. immigration courts, making ineligible asylum. Homeland Security allow migrants apply immediately work authorization used number legal pathways seek asylum, including making appointment CBP One app enrolling parole process designated nationals Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela Nicaragua. Adams also called federal government implement “decompression strategies” make sure cities, like New York, aren’t taking disproportionate amount burden shelter newly arrived immigrants. week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced $77 million funding communities receiving migrants, bringing total given cities along border interior, like New York, $770 million. Biden administration also asked Congress approve $600 million cities taking migrants. Adams says city incur $12 billion bill doesn’t get help shelter migrants, called federal state governments support city. Meanwhile, state's governor, also Democrat, accused Adams taking long communicate state take action avoid crisis. 12-page letter Adams last week, Gov. Kathy Hochul said, “The city act proactive collaborative manner state." But, like Adams, Hochul wants federal government, including way migrants find work. Thursday, Hochul sent letter President Joe Biden asking federal government "expedite work authorizations," "provide state city significant financial assistance" let city use federal buildings shelters. "I cannot ask New Yorkers pay fundamentally federal responsibility," wrote, "and urge federal government take prompt significant action today meet obligation New York state."
