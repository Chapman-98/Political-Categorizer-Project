long I’ve covered politics, “hold nose vote” trope staple zeitgeist  Sometimes it’s “lesser two evils” “least two bad options,” point same  “South Park” put twist “choice” October 2004, depicted coincidentally timed “school mascot election” choice “giant douche” “turd sandwich,” complete lecture end importance voting even choice two unappetizing options  Which, course, brings always uplifting joyful campaign Donald Trump Joe Biden — third-ever campaign two presidents first modern age  Unlike elections, voters don’t imagine either presidency going look like — already picture  It’s ultimate choice election, whatever outcome, voters can’t say weren’t warned  uncomfortable truth choice election last slice people deciding way vote don’t love options  hold noses vote one presidents? decide stay home? simply vote third-party skip presidential race altogether ballots? I’ve noted previously, election going decided two kinds “swing” voters: independents truly vacillating Biden Trump disaffected partisans deciding whether vote not  Obviously, knew voters likely answer questions, I’d moving U K  legally betting outcome! question I’ve pondering — many strategist Trump Biden camps trying figure — last undecided voters need hear  What’s best way get fence, whether it’s Biden-or-Trump fence “do bother vote” fence? campaigns easier time trying message disaffected partisans  Essentially, parties trying lure disaffected partisans back fold scaring side cheap “guilt association” tactics — think “Soros-funded progressives” “MAGA conservatives ” Biden’s team also believes issue abortion way get voters aren’t thrilled Biden show behalf, especially younger voters  Trump’s folks believe border economy enough get Nikki Haley Republicans others GOP don’t like Trump’s character hold noses “come home ” there’s final chunk voters think looking one candidates something else: admit failure tenures express regret decisions didn’t make  Ultimately, voters want know candidates support actually listening responding concerns, even concerns change  We’ve presidents acknowledged voter disappointment following rebukes polls (usually midterms)  Bill Clinton 1994 elections  Two years later, set re-election campaign used State Union address declare, “The era big government over ” way virtue-signaling middle he’d back trying tackle health care another big-government idea  Clinton would eventually clean middle-of-the-road voter 1996  Barack Obama called 2010 midterm results “shellacking” curtailed ambitions beyond health care elections, prominently stopping drive cap-and-trade law curtail carbon emissions  Even George W  Bush made gesture responding voter rebuke Iraq 2006 midterms firing Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld bringing Bob Gates  mea culpas current presidents facing owe voters? I’m sure many fairly long list, especially candidate dislike most  I’d argue there’s plenty presidents acknowledge didn’t get quite right  question this: either candidate capable admitting failure showing kind humility? comes major failure candidates, there’s one obvious place start: inability bring country together  believe it’s fact kept either gentleman taking anything margin-of-error lead polls  common refrain “double hater” voters I’ve talked exhaustion political divide  either candidate could somehow conjure elixir ease feeling, would go long way voters  Right now, it’s hard argue voters think country won’t much better place regardless wins  There’s doom gloom feeling among voters palpable  Now, Donald Trump mea culpas aren’t something go together like peanut butter jelly  Peanut butter tuna fish, maybe  fact, presidents don’t like admit wrong — colleagues joke, presidents always seem “communication challenges” poll numbers go down  Rarely presidents want admit idea bad  presidents supremely confident ability persuade, easier time admitting communication failures actual policy mistakes  also idea running minds many political strategists admitting failure shows weakness weakness erodes confidence time  That’s Trump would tell you: Never say you’re sorry  Never admit mistake  Find somebody else blame  that’s campaign candidacy Joe Biden presented country 2019 2020  can’t help wonder whether Biden’s problems part electorate stem failure fulfill lofty promise made first day presidency  inaugural address, days Jan  6 riot, Biden said: “Today, January day, whole soul this: Bringing America together  Uniting people  uniting nation  ask every American join cause  Uniting fight common foes face: anger, resentment, hatred  Extremism, lawlessness, violence  Disease, joblessness, hopelessness  unity great things  Important things ” paragraph something perhaps new president would say want believe  Biden took promise step speech: “I know speaking unity sound like foolish fantasy  know forces divide us deep real  also know new  history constant struggle American ideal created equal harsh, ugly reality racism, nativism, fear demonization long torn us apart  battle perennial  Victory never assured  “Through Civil War, Great Depression, world war, 9/11, struggle, sacrifice setbacks, ‘better angels’ always prevailed  moments, enough us came together carry us forward  now  History, faith reason show way, way unity  see adversaries neighbors  treat dignity respect  join forces, stop shouting lower temperature  “For without unity, peace, bitterness fury  progress, exhausting outrage  nation, state chaos  historic moment crisis challenge, unity path forward  must meet moment United States America ” Nearly four years later, I’m sure many Americans would agree we’ve made much progress we’ve gotten less exhausting outrage  aren’t unified — anything, country feels divided, parties seem divided ever, well  One reasons 70% country believes wrong track lack faith ability come together or, specifically, political leaders’ ability go extra mile bring us together  Presidents go 80% way unity, whether that’s fair not  Hoping meet party power “halfway” tad naive  Many folks don’t believe side (whichever them) serious unity beyond looking like is  I’m convinced Biden going mea culpa inability bring country together inability turn page Trump, even though think central premise campaign, least last slice voters put top  doubt people around president Biden believe prevented bringing country together elements outside control, including media fragmentation, partisans GOP, “stolen election” narrative pushed Trump amplified forces outside borders intentionally trying divide us  there’s part rings true  I’m sitting saying needs find someone entity left throw bus  honest inability fulfill promise inaugural address  What’s plan bring country together second term? What’s plan heal soul nation? introduce tolerance differing political opinions party don’t like hear populist right? There’s growing perception among many centrists Democratic Party — perhaps among Nikki Haley Republicans, well — Biden doesn’t speak centrist-sounding president fear alienating base  It’s similar argument Trump’s orbit make trying placate centrists GOP  Trump insurgent leader, insurgents can’t lead troops successfully compromise much alienate them  last days 2016 election, Trump form mea culpa  finally acknowledged Obama born U S  course, watch video Trump rare mea culpa, trappings hostage tape  important moment end campaign  advisers convinced Trump needed show humility something, birther issue obvious place start  Ironically, doubt 2024 Trump would 2016 Trump birther business, given much clung stolen election fantasy  point may worked 2016  Voters didn’t like Hillary Clinton looking hope hang Trump, tiny mea culpa might it  brings back Biden current polling predicament  Compared last two Democratic presidents re-election, yet mea culpa public humble pie moment  basically rebuked midterms, look exit poll voters asked job doing  Biden’s party much better expected, White House ditched “we hear you” messaging favor “we successful first midterm Democratic incumbent decades” narrative  hindsight, I’m sure choice  Biden’s Democratic Party overperformed 2022 despite reservations leadership, it  now, Biden hasn’t yet moment able acknowledge public heard disappointment voters  White House still believes communications problem communicator problem, policy problem culture problem  bottom line this: think little humility still goes long way American voter  doesn’t, we’re doomed horrible presidential choices next decades  I’m right, first one two unpopular presidents credibly looks voters eye says, “Here’s I’m gonna differently, mistakes made correct” — person likely president gets serve second four years  Challenge accepted Last week, asked whether anyone could come example major American campaign featuring deeply unpopular incumbent still succeeded  noted closest parallel Biden’s current situation probably overseas, French President Emmanuel Macon re-election far-right candidate Marine Le Pen despite sporting lower job rating Biden  Well, longtime reader Southern California political analyst, Howard Cohen, reminded example closer home: then-California Gov  Gray Davis successful re-election 2002 despite underwater job rating  Davis great parallel: modern pioneer using campaign cash try “help” Republicans decide nominee  state’s all-party, top-two primary system enacted, California conventional primaries like states  Davis’ campaign didn’t want face former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan general election, Democrats “helped” another Republican candidate, Bill Simon, make conservative case Riordan  primary interference worked, Davis able make idea Simon governor unpopular choice re-electing Davis  course, Davis’ campaign worked well inspired recall less year later, giving Arnold Schwarzenegger opening make California history  Thanks, Howard, California history lesson! week Chuck ToddCast NBC News, Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg explores strongest potential re-election messages President Biden  Sign get new episodes Chuck ToddCast, every Wednesday Friday, Apple Podcasts, Spotify wherever get podcasts
