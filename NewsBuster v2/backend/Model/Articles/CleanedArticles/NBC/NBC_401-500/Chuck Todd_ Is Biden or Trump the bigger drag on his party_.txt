Democratic candidates battleground states running governing moderates? Folks like Shapiro Sen  Bob Casey, fellow Pennsylvanian, spent lot money years straddling middle ideological spectrum, efforts paid off  Conversely, GOP spent lot time effort trying rebrand Biden Democrat can’t say left, opposed moderate, it’s image that’s starting stick voters  Political campaigns are, constantly like remind folks, binary choices  There’s rarely perfect candidate support, many voters make picks based options available — though year, voting third party skipping vote president also viable “choices ” let’s bottom-line this: Democratic Party Biden problem  arguably concern ever since Biden took oath office 2021  Six months ago, hand-wringing among Democrats concerned Biden’s viability age — proxy larger issue struggles: perception weakness  explain podcast week, perception weakness unique Biden — Democratic Party brand whole — right now  State Union performance enough quiet age arguments, Biden hasn’t improved subtler “strong versus weak” arguments  include may biggest problem electorate: idea either he’s interested changing status quo he’s weak make changes status quo  Whatever one thinks Trump, voters clearly believe fulfill promise continue shake Washington status quo  long electorate wants change — especially among remaining undecided voters — that’s powerful advantage Trump  Biden campaign fix image issue? Given short-attention-span information ecosystem, one always assume there’s time change perception, it’s getting difficult  obvious way try improve Biden’s weakness perception put Biden often places aren’t controlled  more, he’s still limited unscripted public appearances  Biden campaign publicly likes blame legacy media Biden’s perception problems — somehow New York Times’ coverage hurt him  NBC News’ recent national polling showed, Biden’s image voters consume high level legacy media quite good  Biden’s image problems rest America, 40% 60% country consumes information via ecosystems — places Biden rarely trekked  Going Howard Stern’s radio show start, Biden needs widen aperture even more  always odd presidential candidates named Trump tried borrow Trump’s “all above” media strategy 2016  Even now, Trump likely show liberal show Biden conservative show  course, campaign White House confidence principal, perhaps Biden would showing unusual places media ecosystem  now, still seem using cautiously  way see it, caution getting translated weakness voters, that’s never good place presidential candidate be  Bill Clinton Barack Obama pulled comebacks sitting presidents least partially force personalities, despite it  Biden ends winning race re-election, it’ll likely tactics, personality  Biden isn’t situation figure win despite inability speak every part electorate  presents Biden campaign quite dilemma  try fix problems simply go scorched-earth opponent? problem going even negative Trump this: much information voters need him? Perhaps abortion one area electorate could move information Trump’s role tipping makeup Supreme Court overturned Roe v  Wade gave states free rein set abortion policy  (As aside, needed proof live fragmented media climate, check number voters, anywhere 15% 20% polls I’ve seen, think Biden somehow responsible Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision happened president ) beyond Trump’s role abortion, new information Biden introduce move voter? Ultimately, convince remaining winnable voters three things: First, trying change things plans make changes second term  Second, wrote last week, also needs accept voter blame situation country right credibly promise course correction  third, convince voters he’s conventional Democrat  One Trump’s strengths moment unpopularity parties he’s almost critical Republicans Democrats  rhetoric gives credibility “I don’t like politician” voters  Paradoxically, think one reasons many battleground-state Democrats out-poll Biden seen willing buck party Biden is  certainly showcase time buck party  current environment, voters remain gettable, think I’d rather candidate seen critical political parties  biggest reason I’m sure negative attacks Trump work voters Biden needs right voters flooded Trump attacks eight years  Even think voters don’t know negatives Trump know, certainly believe they’ve got information need  Biden still win election? think so, Trump certainly knows lose election  Biden win campaign change conversation swing voters come October?
