Though comments separate Jan. 6 investigation, Justice Department officials said apply broadly. Holt prefaced question saying “the indictment former president, perhaps candidate president, would arguably tear country apart. concern, make decision road here, think things like that?” Garland answered, “We pursue justice without fear favor.” Holt asked whether Trump becoming candidate would affect decision-making, Garland simply repeated Justice Department intended hold anyone guilty crimes accountable. Experts say public evidence Mar-a-Lago case seems unambiguous. “If Trump anyone else, would already faced likely indictment,” said Bradley Moss, lawyer often represents intelligence agency employees cases involving classified information. “It would entirely outside rule law indict him,” said former federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann, NBC News contributor played key role special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe. “The whole point treat people similarly. look past cases, compels bring case.” Former prosecutors experience cases involving classified information say based public information alone, Justice Department enough evidence charge Trump mishandling national defense information. Less clear whether aggravating factors — whether Justice Department prove Trump obstructed justice failing turn documents despite grand jury subpoena. addition Raskin, experienced former terrorism prosecutor, David Rody, another veteran prosecutor left law firm partnership join investigation, widely seen effort beef prosecution team event case goes trial. “The National Security Division doesn’t try lot cases like — would want bring trial lawyers,” said Joyce Vance, former U.S. Attorney NBC News contributor. “It looks like building trial team.” Amid reports Justice Department officials considering whether name special prosecutor Trump declares candidacy president, observers say would bad idea. “To seems idiotic,” said David Laufman, led Justice Department’s Counterintelligence Export Control Section, position held Jay Bratt, key figure investigation Mar-a-Lago case. “It’s precisely cases like much line Department Justice it’s critical DOJ leaders participate discussions whether approve charges,” Laufman said. “They opportunities kick tires hard often possible, ultimately decision approve disapprove first time American history potential criminal charges former president.” added, “It’s already baked criticism … idea relegating special counsel somehow mitigate neutralize criticism far-right ludicrous. it. That’s you’re jobs.” Moss agreed, adding, “I really don’t think special counsel helps anything here. think delay things bogs things down. nobody could take job dragged mud.” everyone believes prosecution Trump warranted, based known facts. One former U.S. attorney, Trump critic, said mere documents mishandling case serious enough merit charging former president, unless prosecutors prove aggravating factors intent share material, obstruction justice. “I think it’s relatively minor case, don’t think bring minor case former president,” person said. Yet currently people serving long prison sentences exactly Trump appears done — taken highly classified information home, allegation gave adversary.

Unluckily Pho, using anti-virus product made Russian cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky, copied highly classified material home computer without knowledge. U.S. officials determined files handed Russian government, leading one worst intelligence losses modern U.S. history. Kaspersky firm denied giving files Russian government. Pho “compromised country’s closely held types intelligence forced NSA abandon important initiatives protect operational capabilities great economic operational cost,” Maryland U.S. Attorney Robert Hur said time. Pho got five years prison. former NSA contractor, Harold Martin, sentenced 2019 prosecutors said took home least 50 terabytes data — equivalent 500 million pages mostly highly classified material — 20 years.

Legal experts say it’s difficult compare two cases former president. closer analogy, say, would prosecution David Petraeus, retired Army general former CIA director, pleaded guilty misdemeanor admitting giving classified material biographer, affair, lied FBI agents questioned it. sentenced two years probation fined $100,000. somewhat similar case, former CIA Director John Deutch pardoned President Bill Clinton 2001 poised plead guilty misdemeanor keeping top secret codeword information computers homes Maryland Massachusetts. envision Trump agreeing admit guilt, men did. Among factors Justice Department weighs whether pursue classified-document mishandling cases, former prosecutors say, whether person knew material included state secrets; whether planned profit information; whether told truth investigators; volume importance classified material. Prosecutors put evidence public record suggesting Trump nefarious intent keeping classified documents, court filings suggest case meets three criteria. FBI headquarters Washington Aug. 15.

FBI seized 11,000 documents Mar-a-Lago, including several hundred marked classified. “The reason almost certainly indicted, view, efforts obstruct conceal documents prevent government recovering them," said Moss. Trump spokesman respond request comment. Trump called investigation illegitimate, lawyers likened document dispute akin late return overdue library book. Even Justice Department decides charges Trump Mar-a-Lago case warranted, prosecutors clear another hurdle: securing agreement intelligence agencies using classified information found Trump’s home open court. It’s uncommon government decide moving forward otherwise winnable case officials conclude can’t risk exposing intelligence information court, according Laufman. NBC News confirmed among documents found Mar-a-Lago highly classified materials related China Iran — information unlikely deemed suitable public airing. “They need get intelligence community play ball,” Laufman said, “and means getting whatever agency owns information agree use classified documents furtherance government prosecution.” broader social political implications indicting Trump, Moss said Justice Department doesn’t consider them, someone Biden administration should. “I would surprised level political ramifications don’t get considered addressed,” said. “It former president, likely opponent incumbent president 2024, never indictment context before. trivial considerations.”
