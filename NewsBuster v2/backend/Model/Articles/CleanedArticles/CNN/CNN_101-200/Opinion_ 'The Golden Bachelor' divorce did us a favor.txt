             (CNN) &#8212; Now that we know the fairy tale didn't happen, what can we learn from "The Golden Bachelor" divorce?The show inspired viewers young and old to believe that everlasting love is possible, even in later life, More than 5 million people tuned in to watch the televised January 4, 2024 wedding of 72-year-old widower and retired restaurateur Gerry Turner and his love, 70-year-old widow and financial services professional Theresa Nist  The ceremony featured heartfelt toasts from the bride and groom's grown daughters from their prior marriages, teen grandchildren as junior bridesmaids and groomsmen and a six-year-old grandson ambling down the aisle as an adorable ringbearer Imagine the shock and sadness of "Bachelor Nation" - just three months later - when the couple called it quits  In an April 12 appearance on Good Morning America, the newlyweds announced that they were divorcing  As Gerry explained to viewers, "Theresa and I have     come to the conclusion mutually that it's probably time for us to - dissolve our marriage  We just feel like it's best for the happiness of each of us to, to live apart "While romantics and Bachelor devotees were crestfallen by the quick collapse of the marriage, Today Show personality Al Roker had a simpler, if unkind, assessment: "It just goes to show that old people can be just as stupid" - presumably as younger people - when it comes to love and marriage I watched "The Golden Bachelor" series religiously, my interest piqued by my professional background as a researcher of older adults' romantic relationships  But I'm also a sucker for a happy ending - especially for two seemingly kind and thoughtful people who found new love years after the devastating deaths of their former spouses  My gut reaction to the golden divorce wasn't surprise or snark or sadness  Rather, my first thought was "I told you so     "In an essay I wrote last year about "The Golden Bachelor," I cautioned that Gerry's final rose ceremony "[didn't] require a Neil Lane engagement ring " And I stand by that assessment  Marriage didn't have to be the end-all and be-all for Gerry and Theresa  Rather, there are many ways to enjoy love, companionship and intimacy without legally marrying - especially the second time around Here are three lessons we can all learn from the "golden" divorce For older couples, marriage may not be the best courseMore and more older adults today are eschewing marriage and cohabitation for "living apart together (LAT)" - which essentially means "going steady," with each keeping their own separate home  Some older adults want love, intimacy, support and companionship from a committed romantic partner, but they want to keep their home and remain in their own community where they have friends, family and routines  LAT arrangements also help older adults simplify finances and inheritance for their children, maintain their independence, keep their routines and schedules and avoid the strain of round-the-clock spousal caregiving Gerry and Theresa mentioned these very concerns when explaining why they called it quits  Gerry was retired and living in his dream lake house in Indiana, while Theresa was still working as a financial services professional in New Jersey  They had talked about buying a home together in South Carolina, but those plans never became a reality As Theresa explained, "we just looked at homes after home, but we never got to the point where we made that decision " Like many other older adults, Gerry and Theresa were happy in their separate lives, and the prospect of togetherness didn't strike them as an improvement  Would a long-distance dating or LAT relationship have been a better choice? I think so, but the truth is, we'll never know Late-life marriage is about more than love: It's the merging of two multi-generational familiesThe public spin that Gerry and Theresa put on their divorce announcement was that they were splitting, in part, for the sake of their families  As Gerry shared on Good Morning America, "The thing that strikes me the most in our conversations     [is] how dedicated both of us are to our families     We just feel like it's best for the happiness of each of us to, to live apart "Whether it's spin or the truth, the merging of two families is a challenge facing nearly all older adults as they form new romantic relationships  Older couples often need to make complex decisions as an extended family, about mundane matters like where to host family holidays or a grandchild's birthday party as well as more serious issues, like caregiving responsibilities, nursing home moves, inheritance, end-of-life medical decisions and more  These challenges often are easier when parents, children and grandchildren live in proximity to each otherand are all on the same page about major life decisions At any age, romantic partners need to respect and support each other's personal goals and prioritiesSome of the most talked about moments of "The Golden Bachelor" were the minor spats between women in the house, and the spirited pickleball matches  But for me, another scene stood out Very late in the season, on their "Fantasy Suite" final date, Gerry asked Theresa for the first time about her work life  Theresa lit up, and spoke proudly about her transition from a wife and mother to a highly successful stock trader  She explained that once her children got older, she developed a passion for the stock market and read every book she could find on stocks and the markets  In her late 40s, Theresa got an entry-level position and then ascended the ranks at a financial services firm - where she continues to work today According to some media reports, Theresa's commitment to her career was the death knell for the marriage  Her desire to keep working was at odds with Gerry's retirement plan  "I still work, so that's the hurdle," Theresa shared on a podcast  Gerry, however, told listeners, "I've been retired for a long time  I wanted fun [and] adventure     So that is the crux of it "Regardless of the specifics of this case, couples need more than just one another to be happy  If a partner cannot support and cheer on one another's passions (even if they don't share those passions themselves), the relationship may sputter and die  While shared interests - whether for board games, gardening, Broadway musicals or politics, also are a key to a happy relationship, it's respect for differences that can sustain a couple in the longer haul                       Opinion by Deborah Carr         TM & Â© 2024 Cable News Network, Inc , a Time Warner Company  All rights reserved
