             (CNN) &#8212; Russia is holding a presidential election that is all but certain to extend Vladimir Putin's rule throughout this decade and into the 2030s Most votes will be cast over three days from Friday, though early and postal voting started earlier, including in occupied parts of Ukraine where Russian forces are attempting to exert authority But this is not a normal election; the poll is essentially a constitutional box-ticking exercise that carries no prospect of removing Putin from power The president's dominance over the Russian electoral system has already been reinforced as the election looms  The country's only anti-war candidate has been barred from standing, and Alexey Navalny, the poisoned and jailed former opposition leader who was the most prominent anti-Putin voice in Russia, died last month Here's what you need to know about the election When and where is the election taking place?Voting takes place from Friday March 15 until Sunday March 17, the first Russian presidential election to take place over three days; voting was underway earlier, including among Russia's ex-pat population around the world Voting has also been organized in the four Ukrainian regions Russia said it would annex in September 2022, in violation of international law  Russia has already held regional votes and referenda in those occupied territories, an effort dismissed by the international community as a sham but which the Kremlin sees as central to its campaign of Russification A second round of voting would take place three weeks after this weekend if no candidate gets more than half the vote, though it would be a major surprise if that were required  Russians are electing the position of president alone; the next legislative elections, which form the make-up of the Duma, are scheduled for 2026 How long has Putin been in power?Putin signed a law in 2021 that allowed him to run for two more presidential terms, potentially extending his rule until 2036, after a referendum the previous year allowed him to reset the clock on his term limits This election will mark the start of the first of those two extra terms He has essentially been the country's head of state for the entirety of the 21st century, rewriting the rules and conventions of Russia's political system to extend and expand his powers That already makes him Russia's longest-serving ruler since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin Putin's previous efforts to stay in control included a 2008 constitutional amendment that extended presidential terms from four years to six, and a temporary job swap with his then Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev the same year, that preceded a swift return to the presidency in 2012 Is Putin popular in Russia?Truly gauging popular opinion is notoriously difficult in Russia, where the few independent think tanks operate under strict surveillance and where, even in a legitimate survey, many Russians are fearful of criticizing the Kremlin But Putin undoubtedly has reaped the rewards of a political landscape tilted dramatically in his favor  The Levada Center, a non-governmental polling organization, consistently reports Putin's approval rating at over 80% - an eye-popping figure virtually unknown among Western politicians, and a substantial increase on the three-year period before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine The invasion gave Putin a nationalist message around which to rally Russians, boosting his own image, and even as Russia's campaign stuttered over the course of 2023, the war retained widespread support National security is top of mind for Russians as the election approaches; Ukrainian strikes on Russian border regions have brought the war home to many people inside the country, but support for the invasion - euphemistically termed a "special military operation" by Russia's leaders - remains high The Levada Center found at the end of 2023 that "increased inflation and rising food prices may have a lasting impact on the mood of Russians," with the proportion of Russians cutting back on spending increasing But that is not to say Russians expect the election to change the direction of the country  Putin benefits heavily from apathy; most Russians have never witnessed a democratic transfer of power between rival political parties in a traditional presidential election, and expressions of anger at the Kremlin are rare enough to keep much of the population disengaged from politics Putin's former speechwriter, Abbas Gallyamov, told CNN last month that discontent against the president was increasing in Russia  Gallyamov said Putin is attempting to eliminate opposition leaders from society to at least ensure such discontent remains "unstructured," "disorganized" and "leaderless" ahead of future elections Who else is running?Candidates in Russian elections are tightly controlled by the Central Election Commission (CEC), enabling Putin to run against a favorable field and reducing the potential for an opposition candidate to gain momentum The same is true this year  "Each candidate fields juxtaposing ideologies and domestic policies, but collectively they feed into Putin's aim of tightening his grip on Russia during his next presidential term," wrote Callum Fraser of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank Nikolay Kharitonov will represent the Communist Party, which has been allowed to run a candidate in each election this century, but has not gained as much as a fifth of the vote share since Putin's first presidential election Two other Duma politicians, Leonid Slutsky and Vladislav Davankov, are also running  Davankov is deputy chair of the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, while Slutsky represents the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the party previously led by ultra-nationalist firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who died in 2022  All are considered to be reliably pro-Kremlin But there is notably no candidate who opposes Putin's war in Ukraine; Boris Nadezhdin, previously the only anti-war figure in the field, was barred from standing by the CEC in February after the body claimed he had not received enough legitimate signatures nominating his candidacy In December, another independent candidate who openly spoke out against the war in Ukraine, Yekaterina Duntsova, was rejected by the CEC, citing alleged errors in her campaign group's registration documents  Duntsova later called on people to support Nadezhdin's candidacy Writing on social media in February, opposition activist and Navalny's former aide, Leonid Volkov, dismissed the elections as a "circus," saying they were meant to signal Putin's overwhelming mass support  "You need to understand what the March 'elections' mean for Putin  They are a propaganda effort to spread hopelessness" among the electorate, Volkov said Volkov was attacked outside his house on Tuesday in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius  Lithuania's intelligence agency has said it believes the attack on former Navalny aide Leonid Volkov was likely "Russian organized "The Kremlin on Thursday declined to comment on the assault on Volkov Are the elections fair?Russia's elections are neither free nor fair, and serve essentially as a formality to extend Putin's term in power, according to independent bodies and observers both in and outside the country Putin's successful campaigns have been in part the result of "preferential media treatment, numerous abuses of incumbency, and procedural irregularities during the vote count," according to Freedom House, a global democracy watchdog Outside of election cycles, the Kremlin's propaganda machine targets voters with occasionally hysterical pro-Putin material, and many news websites based outside Russia were blocked following the invasion of Ukraine, though more tech-savvy younger voters have grown accustomed to using VPNs to access them Protests are also tightly restricted, making the public expression of opposition a perilous and rare occurrence Then, as elections come into view, genuine opposition candidates almost inevitably see their candidacies removed or find themselves prevented from seeking office, as Nadezhdin and Duntsova discovered during this cycle "Opposition politicians and activists are frequently targeted with fabricated criminal cases and other forms of administrative harassment designed to prevent their participation in the political process," Freedom House noted in its most recent global report How did Navalny's death affect the runup to the election?The timing of the death of Alexey Navalny - Putin's most prominent critic - served to emphasize the control Russia's leader exerts over his country's politics In one of Navalny's final court appearances before his death, he urged prison service workers to "vote against Putin ""I have a suggestion: to vote for any candidate other than Putin  In order to vote against Putin, you just need to vote for any other candidate," he said on February 8 His death cast an ominous shadow over the campaign  Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, urged the European Union to "not recognize the elections" in a passionate address to its Foreign Affairs Council a few days after she was widowed "Putin killed my husband exactly a month before the so-called elections  These elections are fake, but Putin still needs them  For propaganda  He wants the whole world to believe that everyone in Russia supports and admires him  Don't believe this propaganda," she said Thousands then gathered for Navalny's funeral in Moscow despite the threat of detention by Russian authorities Navalnaya has urged Russian people to turn out at noon on the final day of the elections, March 17, as a show of protest  In a video posted on social media, Navalnaya told Russians they could "vote for any candidate besides Putin, you can ruin your ballot, you can write Navalny on it "She added that Russians did not have to vote, but could "stand at a polling station and then go home    the most important thing is to come "This story has been updated                       CNN's Anna Chernova, Pauline Lockwood and Mariya Knight contributed reporting          TM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc , a Time Warner Company  All rights reserved
