It's 9 00 a m  on a Sunday morning in early Spring, and we are waiting for the kids to come out onto the soccer field  Some of us are holding coffee cups  We have all gotten up early to take our fourth and fifth graders to this south-eastern district of Berlin, where they will be playing the Kopenicker FC in just a bit The conversation revolves around school and recent vacations, as I ask my fellow soccer moms and dads about the US election, explaining that I am working on a piece for CNN opinion  Do they follow US politics? And what do they think about it?"I'm very worried," says Jorg, who has been with our club forever and whose 18-year-old son Miguel is our kid's coach  Jorg works service shifts for a local train company and whenever his hours allow, he tells me, he watches the late-night political talk shows which frequently discuss the possibility of a second Donald Trump presidency "To me," he goes on, "Trump seems like the leader of a sect  His supporters would follow him whatever he does  That's scary " If Trump is elected, Jorg is convinced, he would withdraw American troops from Europe and stop aid to Ukraine "I'm scared, too," says Eda, who teaches politics at a Berlin middle school, and Piero agrees  Piero is an urban researcher and lecturer from Italy and has been living in Berlin for many years now  Both Piero and Eda follow US news closely, like Jorg Piero says many things about this election remain incomprehensible to him  He is startled by the Biden-Trump rematch  "The Democrats have failed to build a successor when there was still time," he says  "That I just don't understand "Six months ahead of the vote, this soccer field conversation reflects the German view of the US elections quite well  Conversations do not necessarily circle around it naturally outside the Berlin politics bubble  After all, there are enough things to worry about: the war in Gaza, the war in Ukraine, finding a plumber in an economy increasingly marked by labor shortage and making ends meet after a period of high inflation But when I ask about it, I often find that American politics is there at the back of people's minds  The election is like a thunderstorm in the distance that might or might not come down on us, and many people monitor its path The war on Europe's doorstepUS elections have always been intensely reported on in Germany, but this time, there's an added sense of tension  Since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Germany and Europe's long-time security dependence on the United States is at the heart of the political debate European countries have started to step up  Germany has increased its defense spending, is building its defense industry and has spent billions on military and financial aid to Ukraine Still, without US support, Ukraine's situation - and therefore, Europe's - would be dire  The US is both our lifeline and a vulnerability  And people sense it At a campaign rally earlier this year, Donald Trump recalled how he once told a European leader he would "encourage" Russia "to do whatever the hell they want" to any NATO member country that didn't pay their "bills" - meaning, if they didn't live up to their NATO spending pledges Despite the obvious, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has recently taken to publicly playing down the importance of the US elections to Germany and Europe  Asked about the future of NATO if Trump wins, at a press conference in late April, he said he was "fairly confident" that NATO would remain stable "in the next decades ""There will be new presidents all the time," Scholz said casually, referring to the United States It was a rather obvious attempt to soothe the worries of German citizens such as my fellow soccer mums and dads, but if you ask me, it's futile  I also find it unlikely that the Chancellor's exaggerated composure reflects his true thinking When I speak to officials within the German administration, I pick up a rather different mood  Many are busy bracing for the known - and unknown Bracing for the Trump thunderstormIt's a Monday night, in an office somewhere in a vast labyrinth of uniform corridors in a large government building in Berlin  A somewhat tired looking senior government official sits down in an armchair to discuss how Germany is preparing for the outcome of the US elections, for both possible outcomes, as he stresses several times  He asks not to be named, to discuss sensitive matters First, he says, there are efforts to try to get to know and build relations with people close to Trump, Republican senators, representatives and governors  In September last year, Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock herself went on a long tour, touching down, amongst other places, in Texas, where she met with Governor Greg Abbott  Many other German diplomats and officials are touring the US, too, particularly the south and center, to connect Second, he says, the administration is trying to build awareness in Germany's business world that things might get rough, especially in case Trump wins  German US-watchers and diplomats widely expect Trump would slap new tariffs on European goods imported to the US and think he might try to force European companies to cooperate more closely with the US on containing China  But even during a second Biden administration, things might get tougher, the official says  He also expects Congress to stay volatile even if Biden wins Third, Germany is raising the question of what happens if Trump is elected, in meetings with its close European allies, such as Poland and France, the official says  "If Donald Trump is reelected, we have to try to stick together in the European Union, and Poland, France and Germany would have to lead the way," he says  If Europe manages to "stick together," its chances to extract concessions from Trump might be better than many doomsday analysts currently think, he adds  After all, the US depends on the European market, too It's an optimistic view, based on the assumption that Trump will act rationally, as a deal-maker, if elected  But what if this assumption is wrong? What if Trump tries to take America out of NATO or creates a "dormant NATO," a NATO existent only in name?Even if Biden is re-elected, or Trump proves to be more rational than feared, America's democratic backsliding in the past decade has already deeply impacted how German society views America - and will likely continue to do so, no matter what the outcome of the elections is The American dream no moreBack on the soccer field, my conversation with Eda turns to sports  Eda is wearing a Dallas Mavericks shirt  Later that day, the Mavericks will play the LA Clippers, and Eda is a huge NBA fan  She has never been to the US but says she has vowed to go if the Mavericks ever get to the finals, no matter how expensive the tickets Like many in our generation - on the cusp of Generation X and Millennial - Eda and I are very much into American culture  Through all the ups and downs in US-German political relations, we agree, America has stayed a big dream We were politically socialized during George H  Bush's presidency, in fact the first time I ever went to a demonstration as a girl was to protest the first Gulf war But we also remember the euphoria when America elected Barack Obama to be its first Black president  Obama was venerated like a star in Germany, and many of the other parents on the soccer field remember vividly when he came to Berlin in 2008, how traffic came to a standstill because 200,000 flocked to the Siegessaule, the Victory Column, to see him US-German relations have never been just about trade, military cooperation, or the nuclear umbrella  It is also America's soft power, its cultural-political allure, that has brought generations of Germans to view it as natural partner Europe's hard right is watching America closelyIn the past decade, however, that sentiment has shifted  For many younger generation Germans, America has become something of a dark force that fuels anti-democratic movements, rather than the light that emanates from the beacon of freedom On a Friday afternoon, Schahina Gambir gives me a call  She is a representative for the Green party at the Bundestag  Gambir was born in Kabul in 1991 and has grown up in a rural area in northern Germany  She is a member of the committee for foreign affairs but also works on human rights issues The US elections, she says, will of course have an impact on Europe's security  But they will also be felt in German society  "Debates in the US resonate here and could shift Europe further to the right," she says  "Right-wing networks in Europe have connections to right-wing networks in the US  US conspiracy theories spread here and have fueled, for example, the anti-vaxxer-scene here in Germany "As a young woman, she says, she is also worried the US debate on abortion rights could influence Europe  "The United States were one of the first countries to legalize abortion in 1973, they were a model for others  Now, they are moving backwards," she says of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v  Wade "I am worried that the rights we have thought of as established, as a given, might be questioned, here, too, like they are in the United States," says Gambir  Not just abortion rights, she adds, but also the rights of queer communities and people of color As a 32-year-old, Gambir does remember the Obama years  She has travelled to the US, her sister lives in New York and loves it  Many of today's German teenagers and college students, however, only know the US as Trump country, a once great democracy on a slippery slope  Another Trump presidency would not only put Germany's security at risk, but also manifest this view of the US for another four years On the soccer field that day, our kids easily win their game  Eda and her son leave rather content  Later, she sends me a message: The Dallas Mavericks have lost  She adds a crying emoji
