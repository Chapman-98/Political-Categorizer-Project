Moreno added on the radio show  "   where hatred is stoked and fears are what drive our decision making?"During a local forum on race relations in February 2016, Moreno criticized the rise of populism in the election cycle, subtly alluding to candidates such as Vermont Sen  Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, and implied that their support stemmed from a deficiency in education "We're living in an interesting year of populism on both sides of the aisle," Moreno said at the forum, comparing it to politics in South America  "And the best defense against that populism is education  Really being aware, because people do take advantage of ignorance in our society all the time "Moreno's spokesman told CNN, "It's no secret that Bernie, like many others, was initially skeptical of President Trump, but he has never been so happy to be proven wrong about something ""By the time the 2020 election came around, he was an avid supporter and is proud to have been the first candidate for US Senate to endorse President Trump in the 2024 race," the spokesman said In an interview with local news in Cleveland in April 2019, Moreno disputed that he supported the Trump campaign when asked "My daughter works on the Trump campaign," Moreno said  "That doesn't mean I support the Trump campaign  Different story  You can interview my daughter if you like "In response to a request by CNN for evidence of his support for Trump in 2020, Moreno's campaign provided a picture of the back of a man's head they purported to show Moreno attending a speech in October 2020 by then-Trump campaign surrogate Richard Grenell at a Trump Victory Committee event in Cleveland Election acceptance, then election denialismRight after the 2020 election, Moreno repeatedly criticized election deniers, urged Republicans to accept the results and even debunked fraud allegations  But these days, Moreno says the 2020 election was stolen - a conversion that appears tied to his Senate campaigns In December 2021, Moreno's campaign released an ad in which Moreno embraced election denialism "President Trump says the election was stolen, and he's right," Moreno said directly looking into the camera In early February 2022, Moreno dropped out of the Senate race at Trump's urging; Trump eventually endorsed Vance for the Senate seat  In this race, Moreno has continued to embrace false election claims "Anybody who had eyes and ears knows what happened in 2020," Moreno said at an October forum Moreno deleted tweets he posted before the 2020 presidential election urging Americans to "accept the results," and deletedtweets praising mail-in voting - which Trump has falsely claimed is rife with fraud  Moreno removed a post saying he would accept the results himself In one removed tweet from November 29, 2020, more than three weeks after the election, Moreno attacked Trump directly "For @realDonaldTrump  to make claims of a fraudulent election without proof  Potentially irreparable harm to US," he said Also among Moreno's deleted posts is a November 7, 2020 tweet, where he acknowledged Biden's win and called for unity  He purged tweets where he urged conservatives to accept the outcome and debunked fraud allegations by highlighting Republican gains in the House  He also said that he himself voted by mail in 2020, calling it "safe" and "convenient "As rioters poured into the Capitol on January 6, 2021 and in its aftermath - Moreno again broke with Trump  He praised Republican South Carolina Sen  Lindsey Graham, a prominent Trump supporter in the Senate, who declared "count me out" in an impassioned speech on the Senate floor the night of the riot "Lindsay [sic] brought the heat! Nicely said," wrote Moreno In another since-removed tweet from January 7, 2021, Moreno wrote that the rioters "made a "quite a horrific embarrassment for our country "McGuinness, Moreno's spokesman, said he did not see contradiction in Moreno's past comments "Bernie has also been tremendously clear that January 6th has exposed a two-tiered justice system in this country," he said  "People who burned down buildings in June of 2020 faced minimal retribution; grandmothers who walked down the wrong hallway on January 6th are still sitting in federal prison  That is appalling "                      By Andrew Kaczynski and Em Steck, CNN         TM & Â© 2024 Cable News Network, Inc , a Time Warner Company  All rights reserved
