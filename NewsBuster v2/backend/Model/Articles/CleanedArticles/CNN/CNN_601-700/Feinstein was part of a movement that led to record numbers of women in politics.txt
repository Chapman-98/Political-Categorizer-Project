             (CNN) &#8212; Sen  Dianne Feinstein died Thursday, but her trailblazing legacy for women in politics has never been clearer  When the California Democrat first began her political career, she was an outlier  Women were simply hard to find in elected office  Today, they're more common than ever and acceptance of them is higher than it has ever been  Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992, the "Year of the Woman" that saw a record number of female senators elected  Maryland Democrat Barbara Mikulski won a second term, and Feinstein and fellow Democrats Barbara Boxer of California, Patty Murray of Washington and Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois were newly elected  Including the previously elected Kansas Republican Nancy Kassebaum, there were six female senators in early 1993  Feinstein and Boxer were the first two women elected to the US Senate from California  They were the first elected pair of female senators from any state  Take a step back, though, to when Feinstein was first elected to any political office: 1969, when she won a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors  There was a grand total of one woman in the Senate at the time (Maine Republican Margaret Chase Smith)  After Smith lost in 1972, there were no female senators for another five years  At the beginning of this year, there were a record 25 women serving in the Senate  There are also four states where both senators are women - something that might have been unthinkable back in 1969  The election of women in record numbers is a bipartisan affair  While more female senators at the beginning of the year were Democrats or caucused with them (16), nine were Republicans  That's also a record  There was just one Republican female senator when Feinstein started in the Senate  The shift in women in elected office during Feinstein's time in politics came as Americans also shifted on their willingness to vote for them  Consider a question that Gallup has been asking for over 80 years: Would a respondent vote a generally well-qualified person who was a member of their party for president, if they happened to be a woman? In 1969, just 53% of Americans said they would, while 40% said that they would not  When Feinstein was 4 years old in 1937, the numbers were even worse: 64% of Americans said they would not vote for a qualified woman to be president  By 2020, 93% of Americans were saying they'd vote for a woman to be president if they were qualified  Now, obviously, a woman hasn't been elected president yet  We have, however, seen women from both parties run for president with regularity  You'd have to go back to the 2008 GOP presidential primary when there wasn't a high-profile woman running for a party's nomination in an open race  In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton became the first woman to win a major-party nomination for the presidency  More Americans voted for her than eventual winner Republican Donald Trump, who emerged victorious in the Electoral College  In the last presidential cycle, Democrat Kamala Harris became the first woman to win the vice presidency  This cycle, former South Carolina Gov  Nikki Haley is in second or third place in many of the early-state and national polls of the Republican primary  The fact is, it's probably no longer a matter of if a woman will be elected president, but when  This is certainly what the American people believe  When Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992, a plurality (49%) said a woman would be elected president during their lifetime, according to Gallup  By 2021, 71% of Americans said a woman would be elected president in their lifetime, an SSRS survey found  Feinstein was part of a movement that allows hope like that to blossom                        Analysis by Harry Enten, CNN         TM & Â© 2023 Cable News Network, Inc , a Time Warner Company  All rights reserved
