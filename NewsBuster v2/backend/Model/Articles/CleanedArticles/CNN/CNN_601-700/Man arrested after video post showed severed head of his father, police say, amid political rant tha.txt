CNN has reached out to the Bucks County public defender for comment  He was arraigned early Wednesday via video, according to WPVI  A judge ordered him held without bond, court records show  His next hearing is set for February 8 The victim's employer is "deeply saddened about the tragic death of our teammate Michael Mohn," the Army Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District said in a written statement  "He served with our Geo-Environmental Section  Our thoughts and prayers are with the Mohn family and we are focused on supporting our grieving employees at this time "Ex-roommate: Mohn thought the government was after him years agoAs far back as 2016, JustinMohn had shown signs of paranoia and believed the government had been "out to get him," his former roommate Davis Rebhan told CNN Mohn and Rebhan met in 2016 when they were assigned to be roommates at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs, Rebhan said "Even back then he had very clear issues  He would always talk about how the government was out to get him, and it was always like these vague stories about it  He would never give specific examples," Rebhan said  "He would tell me these stories that always seemed exaggerated, so it was hard to take anything he was saying seriously or know what he was saying the truth about ""I thought he was just a weird kid who had some issues," Rebhan said  "But I obviously (wasn't) thinking he would do this or was dangerous "Rebhan said they first lived in student housing for a few months before moving into an apartment off-campus for six months "At one point he had a hysterical fit and smashed the apartment," Rebhan said  "I wasn't home when he did it, so I don't know what triggered it  But we had a long conversation after that, and he told me had undiagnosed PTSD "Rebhan reported the incident to property management and moved out in November 2016, he said 'Deeply politicized, extreme rhetoric'As authorities work to understand the motive behind the alleged crimes, "you can make some assumptions based on his claims in the video that he's been motivated by politics," said McCabe, the former FBI deputy director "The bigger picture here is that this is another example of the fact that the kind of overheated, deeply politicized, extreme rhetoric that you hear sometimes in this country from politically elected officials and leaders actually has an impact on these marginalized people with extremist views who might be     driven to embark in acts of violence," he said "Some of the things that he has said on the video - allegedly referring to woke mobs and things like that - that's not dissimilar from rhetoric that you hear from some politicians that we've heard recently in the primary season," McCabe said "So this kind of language has an effect on the     most vulnerable, most potentially dangerous part of our population  And I think it's something that most security officials are really concerned about "This story has been updated with additional information CNN's Zenebou Sylla and Amanda Jackson contributed to this report                        By Melissa Alonso, Holly Yan, Caroll Alvarado, Danny Freeman, Chris Boyette and Paul P  Murphy, CNN         TM & Â© 2024 Cable News Network, Inc , a Time Warner Company  All rights reserved
