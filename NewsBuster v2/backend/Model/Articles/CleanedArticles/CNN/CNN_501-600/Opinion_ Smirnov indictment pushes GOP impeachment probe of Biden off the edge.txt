             (CNN) &#8212; On Thursday, the Justice Department indicted Alexander Smirnov, a former FBI informant, for lying about President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's involvement in negotiations with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings  Smirnov is a central witness in the House Republicans' Biden impeachment inquiry, which was already circling the drain as committee leaders have persisted in pursuing baseless allegations for political gain According to the indictment, Smirnov lied to the FBI by claiming that officials at Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board years ago, bribed then-Vice President Biden and his son so the vice president would interfere with a criminal investigation into the company  Smirnov now faces charges for making false statements to the FBI and creating false records Smirnov's testimony has been the "heart" of House Oversight Committee Republicans' stumbling "investigation" into impeaching President Biden  News of Smirnov's indictment had Oversight Committee Chair James Comer of Kentucky beating a strategic retreat: "The impeachment inquiry," he said on Thursday, "is not reliant on the FBI's [interview of Smirnov]  It is based on a large record of evidence "That's to be expected from politicians trying to salvage an investigation whose key witness has been exposed  With Smirnov's indictment for fabricating claims, the air is out of the House inquiry's tires  For those in the fact-based world, the oversight committee's impeachment car, driven by Comer, is stuck on the edge of a cliff with two wheels hanging in thin air The Smirnov episode is Exhibit A in what happens when politicians grinding partisan axes make serious public charges without evidence against elected officials  That shameless behavior erodes citizens' precious trust in government Prosecutors learn early that, in white-collar crimes, you'd better have indisputable documents or witnesses whose testimony is thoroughly corroborated before seeking an indictment  Otherwise, you can get seriously burned in the backfire As Hannah Arendt, the dean of 20th century political theorists, wrote in 1971 about years of government lies revealed in the Pentagon Papers amidst the Vietnam War, "There always comes the point beyond which lying becomes counterproductive "Politicians like Comer and GOP Ohio Rep  Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, could learn something from Arendt and from capable prosecutors about tossing aside facts and truth  Unfortunately, the MAGA committee chairs seem to have neither time nor interest in thought, care, competence or real evidence  All that seems to matter to them is repeating the charges enough times for them to sink into the public consciousness In 2016, there was no there there with House Republicans' Benghazi investigation, but the smear looked like it had an adverse effect on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign  So Republicans have apparently decided, "Let's do it again "But don't expect it to work this time  The very smart Democrats now on the House Oversight Committee learned from experience and are onto Comer's political stunts  His claims have been called out by New York Rep  Dan Goldman, a former prosecutor who worked on the first impeachment of former President Donald Trump, and ranking member Rep  Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a constitutional scholar who served on the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol As Yale professor Timothy Snyder, the eminent historian of 20th century totalitarianism, has written, "Students of democracy have argued since ancient times     that the truth matters, and that truth needs defenses " We are lucky to have capable defenders of truth whose counter-punches have been stronger than Comer's feckless jabs  They don't carry the power of reliable facts With Smirnov, Comer has led with his jaw  When you are dealing with a shaky witness whose testimony is the key to your fight plan, you need to muscle up with corroboration  Comer has none Indeed, Comer and Jordan have overhyped Smirnov's testimony so many times, according to the progressive watchdog Congressional Integrity Project, that it's hard to keep count  To cite just one example, last June, Comer told Fox News' Sean Hannity, "This is one of the highest paid, most respected, most trusted, most effective human informants  So what we learned is what the whistleblowers told Sen  Grassley all along  The FBI never investigated this "That last claim is yet another falsehood  This whole investigation into Burisma goes back five years  In early 2020, Rudy Giuliani, Trump's disgraced lawyer who was trying to dig up dirt on Hunter's father, handed documents over to Trump administration Attorney General Bill Barr  According to CNN reporting, Barr told reporters at the time, "'We can't take anything we receive from Ukraine at face value ' Former Pittsburgh US Attorney Scott Brady oversaw the FBI investigation of the Giuliani claims  The 1023 document [memorializing Smirnov's interview] demanded by Comer is among the products of that investigation      The FBI and prosecutors who reviewed the information couldn't corroborate the claims "There's the rub  And Comer's face plant by relying on Smirnov's alleged lies is just the latest in a long string of leaning on witnesses who have provided no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden  They include the president's bookkeeper, Hunter Biden's business associates, his art dealer and a host of others who've said that President Biden is a loving father but was not involved in his son's business deals  Comer seems to have gone to the ends of the Earth to find dirt on the president  But the congressman has ended up with an empty dustbin Impeachment is the most serious non-criminal charge that Congress can bring against a federal official  It is no place to be inflating allegations and to be relying on witnesses whose testimony is not corroborated  Doing so drains public confidence in impeachment as a guardrail on executive abuses of power  Wild charges without basis in reliable evidence insult fact and truth, the foundations of democracy New York University professor Ruth Ben-Ghiat put it this way in her seminal book "Strong Men": "The decay of truth and democratic dissolution proceed hand in hand " Snyder makes the same point: "Once factual truth is no defense in politics, all that remains is spectacle and force "From Comer and Jordan, we've seen plenty of spectacle but an absence of light  These point men for Trump and truthlessness are dangers to democracy                       Opinion by Dennis Aftergut         TM & Â© 2024 Cable News
