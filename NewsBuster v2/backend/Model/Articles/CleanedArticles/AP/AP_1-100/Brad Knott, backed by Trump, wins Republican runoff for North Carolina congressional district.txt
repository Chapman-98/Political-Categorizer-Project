RALEIGH, N C  — Brad Knott, a candidate backed by former President Donald Trump, won the Republican primary runoff for North Carolina’s 13th Congressional District on Tuesday over a rival who suspended her campaign two weeks ago in response to the endorsement The former assistant U S  attorney defeated Kelly Daughtry, a local lawyer and the daughter of a former longtime Republican legislative leader  Daughtry had finished first among 14 candidates in the March 5 primary  But she failed to exceed the 30% necessary to avoid a runoff, which Knott had a right to seek as the second-place finisher Voters on Tuesday were also choosing GOP candidates for the statewide offices of lieutenant governor and state auditor Trump backed Knott in early April  It wasn’t until weeks later, on May 2, that Daughtry, who was also the top fundraiser in the primary, suspended her campaign and threw her support to her rival  But by then, early voting was well underway, and it was too late to take her name off the ballot Daughtry said Trump’s endorsement of Knott made clear to her “that a pathway to victory is no longer feasible ”Knott’s victory once again highlights Trump’s history of successful interventions in North Carolina GOP politics Knott now advances to the November general election, where he’ll take on Democrat Frank Pierce in November  The GOP-dominated General Assembly reconfigured the 13th District last year so that it is more rightward leaning  The new district covers all or parts of eight counties in or close to the capital of Raleigh Current 13th District Democratic Rep  Wiley Nickel chose not to run for reelection, citing the boundary changes  The seat is one of three the GOP expects to add to the U S  House from North Carolina this fall, thanks to redistricting Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, won North Carolina, the country’s ninth-largest state, in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, and the state is expected to be a presidential battleground this fall Trump’s social media post endorsing Knott called him a “Strong Patriot” who would support law enforcement, secure the U S -Mexico border and protect gun rights As for Daughtry, the daughter of a former longtime Republican legislative leader, Trump called her a “RINO” — Republican in Name Only — and someone who “is no friend to MAGA,” a reference to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan This year marks the second time Trump has endorsed a Daughtry opponent; in a 2022 primary for the 13th District, he backed her challenger and then-political newcomer Bo Hines, the ultimate primary winner Trump also endorsed then-U S  Rep  Ted Budd in the 2022 GOP primary for U S  Senate  Budd easily defeated former Gov  Pat McCrory, then went on to win the general election  In the recent March primary, Trump backed first-time candidate Addison McDowell, who ended up winning the 6th Congressional District race In statewide races for Republican nominations Tuesday, the runoff for lieutenant governor was between Hal Weatherman, a former chief of staff to then-Lt  Gov  Dan Forest, and Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O’Neill  The winner will take on Democratic state Sen  Rachel Hunt, daughter of former four-term Gov  Jim Hunt The GOP auditor’s runoff featured candidates Jack Clark and Dave Boliek  The winner will take on Democratic State Auditor Jessica Holmes  Libertarian Party candidates also are running for auditor and lieutenant governor GOP runoff voting was open to registered Republicans and unaffiliated voters who either voted in the March Republican primaries or didn’t vote at all
