It’s ridiculous ”While an AP-NORC poll conducted in October 2022 found that more than 4 in 10 Americans overall trust Democrats to do a better job of handling the issue of abortion, while only 2 in 10 have more trust in Republicans, the poll released Thursday shows that the trust gap between the parties is wider for AAPI adults  Fifty-five percent of AAPI adults trust Democrats on abortion policy, while only 12% trust Republicans More than half of AAPI adults were born outside the U S , according to the survey  For many of those immigrants and their first-generation American children, abortion isn't just viewed as health care — it can also be seen as a right that was not afforded to them in their countries of origin, said Varun Nikore, executive director of AAPI Victory Alliance, a progressive political advocacy organization “I think it has to do with some sort of home country attitudes that are sort of pervasive, but also the strong feeling we’ve had rights and we’ve had access to health care, and now we don’t want to lose something that we had  And it could be that we also came to this country to have better access to health care than we did before,” Nikore said Nearly 6 in 10 AAPI adults don’t want Congress to pass a law preserving states’ ability to set their own laws allowing or restricting abortion, and only 14% support the passage of a law banning access to abortions nationwide Joie Meyer, 24, is a health care consultant in Florida, where abortions are prohibited after 15 weeks of pregnancy  She said that given that other nearby states like Alabama and Georgia have even more restrictive abortion laws, she would have to travel far to receive the procedure “I’m 24 and maybe some people my age are having children, but if I were to get in that position to be pregnant, I don’t think I would feel ready,” she said  “So, that would be something that I would have to think about ”Meyer, who was born in China but has lived in the U S  since an infant, has made plans with a friend in California in case she does need an abortion  Flying across the country might be more time-consuming than driving to the nearest state that provides abortion, but she said she wants to know that she’ll be with someone who can take care of her during the recovery “Even if there’s a closer state, would I want to do that alone and have to really navigate that physical and emotional pain alone? Not really,” Meyer said ___The poll of 1,172 U S  adults who are Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders was conducted from Feb  5-14, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based Amplify AAPI Panel, designed to be representative of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population  The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3 9 percentage points ___Graham Lee Brewer is an Oklahoma City-based member of AP's Race & Ethnicity team  Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux is AP's polling editor
