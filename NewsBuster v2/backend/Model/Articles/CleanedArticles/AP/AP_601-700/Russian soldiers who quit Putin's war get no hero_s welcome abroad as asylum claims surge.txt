War criminals? Or heroes?Overall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection  Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security Andrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West  Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army “Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,” Kubilius said  “To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake ”All but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families  The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail Independent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year Record numbers of people seeking to desert – more than 500 in the first two months of this year – are contacting Idite Lesom, or “Get Lost,” a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia  Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group’s head, Grigory Sverdlin  The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale “Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war," Sverdlin said  "But that’s not true ”The question now is, where can they go?German officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status  In practice, however, it’s proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say Fewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U S  in fiscal year 2022  Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U S  borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021 In France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests  And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany’s Interior Ministry told AP in an email  None of the data specifies how many were soldiers As they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny – and the others – have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain “There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,” Yevgeny said  He urges Western policymakers to reconsider  “After all, it’s much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons ”YEVGENYSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save “It’s like a woman’s handbag, there’s so much stuff,” he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills He can’t find his military medals  He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine Yevgeny seems suddenly ashamed  “I don’t care about them,” he said, shoving everything back in the box The son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free  He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives  The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service The night of Feb  23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept  Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine  Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next On Yevgeny’s second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said  Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him  People got lost and never came back In the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades  One soldier shot another square in the chest  What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered  But Yevgeny wasn’t in that world anymore The deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got “We didn’t want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,” explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men  “The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military  What would you do?”He said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn’t get them back to Russia and didn’t want to build detention centers “Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,” he said  “People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners ”There are things Yevgeny can’t forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed  A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers Yevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat  In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said  The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column Pop, pop, pop go the fireballs  Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game  Shells crash a bit off to the left  Then, a hit  The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it “Very cool,” wrote someone in the comments “The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,” wrote another Yevgeny was in that column  He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire  His face is flat  He doesn’t want to see it again “Many of my friends have died  And these were really good guys who didn’t want to fight,” he said  “But there was no way out for them ”He is crying If he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school  He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems He wants them to understand three words: “You will die ”It took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg “You can only leave wounded or dead,” Yevgeny explained  “No one wants to leave dead ”He made a pact with three other soldiers  They called it their Plan B  Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper  The machine gunner said he didn’t want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he’d stand by their story One chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B  They’d already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission When the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh  Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh  After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out Blood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn’t walk  His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods  He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening Yevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023  But after Putin’s announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said  Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war He knew he had to leave  He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom  Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him  His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched Since then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear  He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat  They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around  They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle He worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food  But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people’s names He doesn’t know what he’ll do when his savings run out  He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States – obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said  He'd like to serve in a U N  mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive of a path from here to there He wakes at 10 o’clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day  That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy At the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia’s September 2022 mobilization  Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine  Tens of thousands of them are now dead The table went quiet  Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it In the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace FARHADWithin hours of Putin’s September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin’s phone  A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad  He’d tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said Panicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight  They’d try to make it look like a fun family vacation  The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin’s draft “Hurrah!” shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia Farhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, where he’d been promised work as a singer  He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted Life was good, but uncertain  Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe  In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted  In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison That same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer  But he was blocked from boarding his flight  “Are you on the wanted list?” a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad’s passport  Farhad went pale  Cold sweat prickled over his body He was led to a room for questioning  A man in civilian clothes sat across from him “You are my Muslim brother,” he told Farhad  “I’m also against the war  Tell me everything ”Farhad confessed Farhad tried to brace himself for what was to come  He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book – Dostoevsky’s “Crime and Punishment” — into a transparent bag  His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet Farhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I’d kill myself first The morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists  “I lay down and thought that’s the end,” Farhad said  “Kaput ” Why would he need all this stuff if he weren’t in for a long incarceration?Two hours later, a police officer appeared  “Take your things and get out,” he ordered Farhad was free Farhad’s lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can’t be extradited  Farhad was safe, at least for the moment “We don’t know what tomorrow will bring,” said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana  “In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law      Everything can change ”In July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad’s application for asylum  What actually happened was that Farhad’s application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said Without an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan  Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case  Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile “It’s not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,” he said  “I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere  We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass ”He changes his SIM card every few months, doesn’t live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions  After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny  His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor  It was impossible to sleep  His back was killing him He thought of the life he’d left behind in Russia  “In Kazan, I had a completely different life  I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,” he said  “Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don’t know what  And without any money in my pocket  It’s very depressing,” Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed Farhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn’t ask for documents  Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing” to his co-workers After work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours  He dreamed of starting a family but couldn’t afford to take a woman out to the movies  “I can’t fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,” he said  “So I just walk around and sing songs ”But he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice “I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,” he said  “If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution ”Six months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead  He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments  He’s been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end  He doesn’t know what to do next SPARROWSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death  The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money  His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village Later, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle The company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds  They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks  As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow Sparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept  23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources  They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe “They said, ‘You're fired,’” Sparrow recalled  “You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point  If you don’t, you’ll have a criminal case against you ”Sparrow obeyed  At 6 a m  the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital The thought of war did not cross Sparrow’s mind  All he could think about was his job  Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks  Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road  Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe  Why had they fired him?When he arrived, the military base was chaos  Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders  Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink  He couldn’t find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor The next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge  But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers  “I saw this photo – what is all this?” he thought  “I’m not going anywhere to kill people – never!”Sparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent  He would serve in a different way  He could pay The commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn’t fight with the Russian armed forces, he’d end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin’s then-powerful Wagner Group  “You still have just one path,” his commander told him  “Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner ”He was 30 years old  He called his mother for help Sparrow’s guts couldn’t take it  He ran to the bathroom  He paced in anxious circles  Then ran to the bathroom again  And again “What’s wrong with you?” his commander demanded “I just have some stomach problems,” Sparrow said While the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall  His mother was waiting on the other side The next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town  Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan Astana felt fresh and warm  He realized he’d been cold his entire life “I am free,” he told himself Freedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage Two weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him  Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back  The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia’s criminal code  Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia Security agents interrogated his mother back in Russia  Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was  In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting  He said he’d wait for a summons  None ever came Sparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment  Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites He was going to bed at 4 a m  and waking at noon  He couldn’t even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather Sparrow’s eyes went red with tears “I don’t want anything in life  I have no interest in my own affairs,” he said  “Sometimes I don’t understand myself  I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what’s going on in Ukraine, and that’s it ”He doesn’t know the status of his own asylum applications  Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn’t  Why try?Outside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have “There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,” he said  “I’d rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia’s fault  I don’t regret it ”SPORTSMASTERAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run  His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs  She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school  The family wouldn’t have to pay a cent  It looked like a ticket to a better life At the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician  But his real passion was sports  He wanted to run faster than anyone else Now known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat  He stayed in service even after he’d fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn’t want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?The night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a m  and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief  By dawn, all hope had drained from his body  He knew he would be ordered to fight “At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,” he said  “I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine ”Sportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base  In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming His coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they’d find something easy for him to do and he’d get paid again  It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor His commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero  As he entered the room, they began to speak  It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation  Order  Luhansk He realized they were reading out his combat orders  He’d been tricked  They told him to sign He refused to touch the pen The brigade’s chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia’s Criminal Code  “You either go to jail or you go there," he said  "You have only two options "Seized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave  He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside  His division’s chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run He pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint  He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2 5 meters tall, without a scratch “What I felt was only disgust,” he said Idite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia  AP is withholding details of the route Before he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship “They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,” he said to the camera  “Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days ”And he did what he could to make a grand gesture “Putin wanted me to be in a bag,” he said  “But it’s his uniform that will be in a bag ”He shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster Near midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping  As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile The bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier “I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,” he said By that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming  He was optimistic  At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war “The worst thing that could have happened has happened,” he said  “Now only good things are coming ”Sportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana Six months later, like the other deserters, he’s hiding in plain sight  No SIM card of his own  No clear path to citizenship or asylum  The gnawing peril of a knock at the door “There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia’s wing,” he said  “I can’t say it’s as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn "He doesn’t have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he’d likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia While he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work in Astana “I am for people to not get stuck,” he said, bursting into an incandescent smile When he runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace  His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease — if only for a moment — with his place in the world He wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity “Something new is starting,” he said  “I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me ”___AP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in
