nominationCHARLESTON, S C  — Donald Trump won South Carolina’s Republican primary on Saturday, easily beating former U N  Ambassador Nikki Haley in her home state and further consolidating his path to a third straight GOP nomination Trump has now swept every contest that counted for Republican delegates, adding to previous wins in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and the U S  Virgin Islands  Haley is facing growing pressure to leave the race but says she's not going anywhere despite losing the state where she was governor from 2011 to 2017 A 2020 rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden is becoming increasingly inevitable  Haley has vowed to stay in the race through at least the batch of primaries on March 5, known as Super Tuesday, but was unable to dent Trump’s momentum in her home state despite holding far more campaign events and arguing that the indictments against Trump will hamstring him against Biden The Associated Press declared Trump the winner as polls closed statewide at 7 p m  That race call was based on an analysis of AP VoteCast, a comprehensive survey of Republican South Carolina primary voters  The survey confirmed the findings of pre-Election Day polls showing Trump far outpacing Haley statewide “I have never seen the Republican Party so unified as it is right now,” Trump declared, taking the stage for his victory speech mere moments after polls closed  He added, “You can celebrate for about 15 minutes, but then we have to get back to work ”___Takeaways from South Carolina primary: Donald Trump's Republican home field advantage is everywhereNEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump trounced Nikki Haley on Saturday in the South Carolina primary, a victory that emphatically punctuated the depth and breadth of his support among Republican primary voters as he vanquished his lone remaining major opponent in her home state Trump did not even have to mount a vigorous campaign, making few appearances and spending relatively little money  Haley has vowed to stay in the race and planned to visit Michigan, the site of the next primary, on Sunday  But the loss further eroded the rationale for her candidacy, barring something unforeseen that would derail the former president Here are some takeaways from the South Carolina leg of the campaign:Haley talked up her chances in “my sweet state of South Carolina” for months  Twice elected governor, initially as a tea party candidate in 2010, she was universally known in her state, and mostly for positive reasons  She had even served as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations  Her conservative record was clear And yet her credentials were no match for Trump's hold on the party ___Israeli officials to meet on a proposed pause in Gaza while the Cabinet is set to OK a Rafah planDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli officials will meet Saturday night on the next steps after the latest talks with the United States, Egypt and Qatar in search of a deal on pausing the fighting in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said But Netanyahu announced that he'll convene the Cabinet early next week to “approve the operational plans for action in Rafah,” including the evacuation of civilians, despite widespread warnings from the international community about a military ground operation in the southern city where more than half of Gaza's population shelters  "Only a combination of military pressure and firm negotiations” would achieve Israel's aims in the war, he said A senior official from Egypt, which along with Qatar is a mediator between Israel and the Hamas militant group, said mediators were waiting for Israel's official response to a draft deal that includes the release of up to 40 women and older hostages held in Gaza in return for up to 300 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, mostly women, minors and older people The Egyptian official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations, said the proposed six-week pause in fighting would include allowing hundreds of aid trucks to enter Gaza every day, including the northern half of the besieged territory  He said that both sides agreed to continue negotiations during the pause for further releases and a permanent cease-fire Negotiators face an unofficial deadline of the start of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan around March 10 ___US and
