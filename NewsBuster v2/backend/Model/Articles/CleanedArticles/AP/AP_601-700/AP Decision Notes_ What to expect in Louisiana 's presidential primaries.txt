dominated this year by new Republican Gov  Jeff Landry’s special legislative sessions to address crime and adopt new congressional maps  On Saturday, the focus will shift to the state’s presidential primaries There’s little doubt who will win Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, the former president, unofficially sewed up their parties’ nominations last week  But the process of selecting the nominees has long depended on voters in places such as Louisiana and about two dozen other states and territories where people will vote in primaries and caucuses long after the presumptive nominees have been determined Louisiana also did not play a decisive role in the 2020 primaries It had planned to hold a contest on April 4 of that year, but instead became the first state to postpone its primary in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic  After a second delay, Louisiana held its primary on July 11, followed only by a Democratic primary in Puerto Rico the next day  Biden and Trump, who had already unofficially clinched the 2020 nominations by then, easily won in Louisiana The Louisiana primaries were more competitive in 2016, when they were held in early March, just after that year’s Super Tuesday  Trump narrowly edged Sen  Ted Cruz of Texas in a four-way contest that also included Sen  Marco Rubio of Florida and former Ohio Gov  John Kasich  On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton trounced Sen  Bernie Sanders of Vermont Republicans control the levers of government in Louisiana today, and most of the state’s prominent elected officials have endorsed Trump  That includes Landry, who had Trump’s backing last fall in his race for governor, along with House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Sen  John Kennedy Trump carried Louisiana in the 2016 and 2020 general elections with 58% of the vote  Biden’s statewide showing of about 40% in 2020 slightly improved upon the 38% that Clinton received there four years earlier A look at what to expect on election night:PRIMARY DAYPolls close at 8 p m  CDT, which is 9 p m  EDT WHAT’S ON THE BALLOTThe Democratic ballot lists Biden, Marianne Williamson, former candidate Dean Phillips and five others  On the Republican ballot are Trump, former candidates Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Asa Hutchinson, Vivek Ramaswamy, and three others WHO GETS TO VOTEOnly voters registered with a party may participate in that party’s presidential primary  Democrats can’t vote in the Republican primary and vice versa DELEGATE ALLOCATION RULESThere are 48 pledged Democratic delegates at stake  Ten at-large delegates are allocated in proportion to the statewide vote, as are six PLEO delegates, or “party leaders and elected officials ” The state’s six congressional districts have a combined 32 delegates at stake, which are allocated in proportion to the vote results in each district  Candidates must receive at least 15% of the statewide vote to qualify for any statewide delegates and 15% of the vote in a congressional district to qualify for delegates in that district  Delegates will be awarded using the old 2022 congressional district boundaries, not the new map passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Landry in January There are 47 pledged Republican delegates at stake  They are awarded on a “winner-take-all” basis to the top statewide vote-getter DECISION NOTESLouisiana’s presidential primaries once again are not competitive because Biden and Trump have unofficially clinched their nominations and face no major candidates on the ballot  The release of vote results tends to begin shortly after polls close  The first indications that the two are winning statewide on a level consistent with the overwhelming margins seen in most other contests held this year may be sufficient to determine the statewide winners The Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap  If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory  In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why WHAT DO TURNOUT AND ADVANCE VOTE LOOK LIKEAs of March 1, there were 2,977,408 voters registered in Louisiana  Of those, 38% were registered as Democrats and 34% were registered as Republicans  Turnout for last October’s gubernatorial primary was about 36% of registered voters  Turnout for the twice postponed presidential primaries in 2020 was 9% of registered voters for the Democratic contest and 7% for the Republican  In 2016, Democratic primary turnout was 11% of registered voters, and for Republicans it was 10% The amount of pre-Election Day voting in Louisiana’s presidential primaries jumped significantly from 2016 to 2020 because of the pandemic  In 2016, about 17% of Democratic primary voters and 16% of Republican primary voters cast ballots before primary day  In 2020, after the state expanded early voting and mail-in balloting options, the level rose to 42% for Democrats and 36% for Republicans  In the 2023 gubernatorial primary, pre-Election Day voting was at about 34% of total votes cast As of March 15, a total of 130,549 voters had cast ballots before Election Day  About 46% of those came from Democrats and about 48% came from Republicans HOW LONG DOES VOTE-COUNTING USUALLY TAKE?In the 2023
