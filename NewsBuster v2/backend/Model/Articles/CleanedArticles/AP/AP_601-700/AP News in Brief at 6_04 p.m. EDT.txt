What is going on???"State election officials soon found themselves forced to respond  They said the user, who pledges to fight, expose and mock “wokeness,” was wrong and had distorted Social Security Administration data  Actual voter registrations during the time period cited were much lower than the numbers being shared online ___Israel says its strike that killed aid workers was a mistake  Rights groups say it was no anomalyCAIRO (AP) — Two basic mistakes, according to the Israeli military  First, officers overlooked a message detailing the vehicles in the convoy  Second, a spotter saw someone boarding one car, carrying something – possibly a bag – that he thought was a weapon  Officials say the result was the series of Israeli drone strikes that killed seven aid workers on a dark Gaza road The Israeli military has described the deadly strike on the World Central Kitchen convoy as a tragic error  Its explanation raises the question: If that's the case, how often has Israel made such mistakes in its 6-month-old offensive in Gaza?Rights groups and aid workers say Monday night’s mistake was hardly an anomaly  They say the wider problem is not violations of the military’s rules of engagement but the rules themselves In Israel’s drive to destroy Hamas after its Oct  7 attacks, the rights groups and aid workers say, the military seems to have given itself wide leeway to determine what is a target and how many civilian deaths it allows as “collateral damage ”More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, around two-thirds of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry  Its count doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants ___For families of hostages, it's a race against time as Israel's war reaches six-month markJERUSALEM (AP) — It’s the last wish of a dying mother, to be with her daughter once more  But six months into Israel's war against Hamas, time is running out for Liora Argamani, who hopes to stay alive long enough to see her kidnapped daughter come home “I want to see her one more time  Talk to her one more time,” said Argamani, 61, who has stage four brain cancer  “I don’t have a lot of time left in this world ”Noa Argamani was abducted from a music festival Oct  7 when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage  The video of her abduction was among the first to surface, images of her horrified face widely shared — Noa detained between two men on a motorcycle, one arm outstretched and the other held down as she screams “Don't kill me!”There's been little news about Noa, 26  But in mid-January, Hamas released a video of her in captivity  She appears gaunt and under duress, speaking about other hostages killed in airstrikes and frantically calling on Israel to bring her and others home Half a year into Israel’s war, agonized families such as the Argamanis are in a race against time  In November, a weeklong cease-fire deal saw the release of more than 100 hostages  But the war is dragging on, with no end in sight and no serious hostage deal on the table  Israel says more than 130 hostages remain, with about a quarter of those believed dead, and divisions are deepening in the country over the best way to bring them home ___Iranian commander renews vow to avenge Syria strike attributed to Israel that killed 2 generalsISFAHAN, Iran (AP) — A top military commander Saturday renewed Iran's promise to retaliate after an airstrike earlier this week widely blamed on Israel destroyed Iran’s consulate in Syria, killing 12 people, including two elite Iranian generals Gen  Mohammad Bagheri, Iran’s joint chief of staff, told mourners gathered for the funeral of Gen  Mohammad Reza Zahdi that Iran will decide when and how to stage an “operation” to take revenge  Zahdi was the highest ranking commander slain in Monday’s attack “The time, type, plan of the operation will be decided by us, in a way that makes Israel regret what it did," he said  "This will definitely be done ”The attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound was a significant escalation in a long-running shadow war between the two archenemies, and Israel has been bracing for an Iranian response In all, 12 people were killed in the strike: Seven Iranian Revolutionary Guard members, four Syrians and a Hezbollah militia member ___Some states are seeking to restrict TikTok  That doesn't mean their governors aren't using itHARRISBURG, Pa  (AP) — POV: You’re on TikTok, and so is your governor — even as your Legislature considers banning the app from state-owned devices and networks Efforts to ban TikTok over security concerns about China's influence through the platform have picked up steam in the past year in state legislatures, with an expansive ban even proposed by Congress  In Pennsylvania, forward movement on a bill that first unanimously passed the state Senate last year could send legislation to the Democratic governor’s desk imminently But even as the app faces scrutiny and bans, governors and state agencies — and even President Joe Biden — are still using the app to promote their initiatives and expand their voting pool  Their target is the youth vote, or the people who largely make up the app's U S  user base of 170 million Pennsylvania Gov  Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, is a prolific poster, with his efforts beginning on the campaign trail through a personal account  The first-termer is a rising star in the Democratic Party and is among governors building national profiles and possibly positioning themselves for a 2028 run for the White House His careful messaging extends to his official governor account on TikTok  All colored with his priorities and stances, videos have him participating in viral trends, breaking down aspects of his budget proposal, and even taking a dig at Texas via a Beyoncé song ___New York City's skyscrapers are built to withstand most earthquakesNEW YORK (AP) — The ground rumbled Friday beneath New York City, home to famous skyscrapers like the Empire State Building and One World Trade Center  Though buildings that can reach above 100 stories might seem especially vulnerable to earthquakes, engineering experts say skyscrapers are built with enough flexibility to withstand moderate shaking The 4 8 magnitude quake on Friday morning was centered about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of the city in New Jersey  New York Gov  Kathy Hochul said Saturday there had since been at least 25 aftershocks, some of which were felt in New York City  But no major damage had been reported to the city's roads, mass transit system or its 1 1 million buildings Operators of the iconic 103-floor Empire State Building posted “I AM FINE” on Friday on the building's X account New York’s skyscrapers have been generally built to withstand winds and other impacts far greater than the earthquakes generally seen on the East Coast, said Elisabeth Malsch, a managing principal at Thornton Tomasetti, a New York engineering firm that’s done major work on the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building and the Brooklyn Bridge, among other major city landmarks “The earthquake that we design for is one that’s unlikely to happen  It’s a thousand-year event,” she explained  “So we don’t expect it to happen more than once in a thousand years ”___State Republicans killed an Indiana city's lawsuit to stop illegal gun sales  Why?INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Almost 25 years after suing the firearms industry for failing to prevent illegal gun sales, the northwestern Indiana city of Gary won a critical victory last fall when a judge ordered gun manufacturers to hand over years of production and sales records But in March, Gov  Eric Holcomb signed a new law retroactively banning cities from bringing such lawsuits, effectively halting the case  Republicans said the gun industry is not responsible for illegal sales  Critics say the legislation shows lawmakers don’t consider ending gun crime a priority and reflects their apathy for Gary's majority Black residents “There’s gun violence everywhere you turn in America,” longtime Gary resident Rev  Dena Holland-Neal said  “And someone has to be accountable ”Gary is more racially diverse than the rest of Indiana and, sitting just east of Chicago, is one of its few Democratic strongholds  Most of its estimated 67,970 population is Black in contrast to 10% of people statewide, according to the U S  Census Bureau Hospital chaplain Carmen McKee, who counsels victims of gun violence and their families, said racism underscores the actions of policymakers who dismiss Gary’s needs as, “‘It’s just Gary’ or ’It’s just another area of people of color ’”___Small town businesses embrace total solar eclipse crowd, come rain or shine on MondayWAXAHACHIE, Texas (AP) — The last time a total solar eclipse passed through this Texas town, horses and buggies filled the streets and cotton fetched 9 cents a pound  Nearly 150 years later, one thing hasn’t changed: the threat of clouds blocking the view Overcast skies are forecast for Monday’s cosmic wonder across Texas, already packing in eclipse chasers to the delight of small town businesses As the moon covers the sun, daytime darkness will follow a narrow corridor — from Mexico’s Pacific coast to Texas and 14 other states all the way to Maine and the eastern fringes of Canada  The best U S  forecast: northern New England Like other communities along the path of totality, Waxahachie, a half-hour’s drive south of Dallas, is pulling out all the stops with a weekend full of concerts and other festivities It’s the region’s first total solar eclipse since 1878  The next one won’t be for almost another 300 years
