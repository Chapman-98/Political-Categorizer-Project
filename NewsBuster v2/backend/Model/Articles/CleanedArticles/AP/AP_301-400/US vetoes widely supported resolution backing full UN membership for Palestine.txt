What will you do?”Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have been stalled for years, and Israel’s right-wing government is dominated by hard-liners who oppose Palestinian statehood Israeli U N  Ambassador Gilad Erdan called the resolution “disconnected to the reality on the ground” and warned that it “will cause only destruction for years to come and harm any chance for future dialogue ”Six months after the Oct  7 attack by the Hamas militant group, which controlled Gaza, and the killing of 1,200 people in “the most brutal massacre of Jews since the Holocaust,” he accused the Security Council of seeking “to reward the perpetrators of these atrocities with statehood ”Israel’s military offensive in response has killed over 32,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, and destroyed much of the territory, which speaker after speaker denounced Thursday After the vote, Erdan thanked the United States and particularly President Joe Biden “for standing up for truth and morality in the face of hypocrisy and politics ”He called the Palestinian Authority — which controls the West Bank and the U S  wants to see take over Gaza where Hamas still has sway — “a terror supporting entity ”The Israeli U N  ambassador referred to the requirements for U N  membership – accepting the obligations in the U N  Charter and being a “peace-loving” state “How can you say seriously that the Palestinians are peace loving? How?” Erdan asked  “The Palestinians are paying terrorists, paying them to slaughter us  None of their leaders condemns terrorism, nor the Oct  7 massacre  They call Hamas their brothers ”Despite the Palestinian failure to meet the criteria for U N  membership, Erdan said most council members supported it “It’s very sad because your vote will only embolden Palestinian rejectionism every more and make peace almost impossible,” he said
