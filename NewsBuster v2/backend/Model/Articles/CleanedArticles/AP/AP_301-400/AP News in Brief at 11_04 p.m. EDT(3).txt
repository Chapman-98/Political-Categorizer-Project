attacksJERUSALEM — Hamas said Monday it accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal, but Israel said the deal did not meet its core demands and it was pushing ahead with an assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah  Still, Israel said it would continue negotiations The high-stakes diplomatic moves and military brinkmanship left a glimmer of hope alive — but only barely — for an accord that could bring at least a pause in the 7-month-old war that has devastated the Gaza Strip  Hanging over the wrangling was the threat of an all-out Israeli assault on Rafah, a move the United States strongly opposes and that aid groups warn will be disastrous for some 1 4 million Palestinians taking refuge there Hamas's abrupt acceptance of the cease-fire deal came hours after Israel ordered an evacuation of some 100,000 Palestinians from eastern neighborhoods of Rafah, signaling an invasion was imminent The Israeli military said it was conducting “targeted strikes” against Hamas in eastern Rafah  Soon after, Israeli tanks entered Rafah, reaching as close as 200 meters (yards) from Rafah’s crossing with neighboring Egypt, a Palestinian security official and an Egyptian official said  Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media  The reported incursion came a day after Hamas militants killed four Israeli soldiers in a mortar attack that Israel said originated near the Rafah crossing The Egyptian official said the operation appeared to be limited  The Associated Press could not independently verify the scope of the operation ___Trump fined $1,000 for gag order violation in hush money case as ex-employee recounts reimbursementsNEW YORK (AP) — The judge in Donald Trump’s hush money trial fined him $1,000 on Monday and, in his sternest warning yet, told the former president that future gag order violations could send him to jail  The reprimand opened a revelatory day of testimony, as jurors for the first time heard the details of the financial transactions at the center of the case and saw payment checks bearing Trump’s signature The testimony from former Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney provided a mechanical but vital recitation of how the company reimbursed payments that were allegedly meant to suppress embarrassing stories from surfacing during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and then logged them as legal expenses in a manner that Manhattan prosecutors say broke the law McConney's appearance on the witness stand came as the first criminal trial of a former U S  president entered its third week of testimony  His account lacked the human drama offered Friday by longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks, but it nonetheless yielded an important building block for prosecutors trying to pull back the curtain on what they say was a corporate records cover-up of transactions designed to protect Trump's presidential bid during a pivotal stretch of the race At the center of the testimony was a $130,000 payment Trump’s then-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in October 2016 to stifle her claims of an extramarital sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier The 34 felony counts of falsifying business records accuse Trump of labeling the money paid to Cohen in his company’s records as legal fees  Prosecutors contend that by paying him income and giving him extra to account for taxes in monthly installments for a year, the Trump executives were able to conceal the reimbursement ___Pro-Palestinian protesters break through barricades to retake MIT encampmentNEW YORK (AP) — Pro-Palestinian protesters that had been blocked by police from accessing an encampment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Monday broke through fencing, linked arms and encircled tents that remained there, as Columbia University canceled its university-wide commencement ceremony following weeks of demonstrations Sam Ihns, a graduate student at MIT studying mechanical engineering and a member of MIT Jews for a Ceasefire, said the group has been at the encampment for the past two weeks and that they were calling for an end to the killing of thousands of people in Gaza “Specifically, our encampment is protesting MIT’s direct research ties to the Israeli Ministry of Defense,” he said Protesters also sat in the middle of Massachusetts Avenue, blocking the street temporarily during rush hour in the Boston area  By evening the atmosphere around the MIT protest grew less tense with protesters listening to speeches and joining chants before taking a pizza dinner break Police in large part had pulled back from the encampment after offering a more robust presence earlier in the day  An MIT spokesperson said the fencing was breached after the arrival of demonstrators from outside the university and that no arrests had been made by Monday night ___Tornadoes spotted in Oklahoma as hail pelts Kansas  Forecasts warn more is to comeOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Tornadoes touched down Monday evening in rural Oklahoma and large hail pelted parts of Kansas as an outbreak of dangerous storms brought the possibility of strong twisters staying on the ground for many miles Forecasters have issued a rare high-risk weather warning for the two states “You can’t rely on waiting to see tornadoes before sheltering tonight,” the National Weather Service said At least four tornadoes had been spotted in north central Oklahoma, including one about a 45-minute drive north of Tulsa  The National Weather Service office there issued a tornado emergency alert Monday night for the nearby towns of Bartlesville, Dewey and Barnsdall The Weather Service warned "a large and life-threatening tornado” was headed toward those towns, with wind gusts up to 70 mph ___Pulitzer Prizes in journalism awarded to The New York Times, The Washington Post, AP and othersNEW YORK (AP) — The New York Times and The Washington Post were awarded three Pulitzer Prizes apiece on Monday for work in 2023 that dealt with everything from the war in Gaza to gun violence, and The Associated Press won in the feature photography category for coverage of global migration to the U S Hamas’ Oct  7 attack on Israel and its aftermath produced work that resulted in two Pulitzers and a special citation  The Times won for text coverage that the Pulitzer board described as “wide-ranging and revelatory,” while the Reuters news service won for its photography  The citation went to journalists and other writers covering the war in Gaza The prestigious public service award went to ProPublica for reporting that “pierced the thick wall of secrecy” around the U S  Supreme Court to show how billionaires gave expensive gifts to justices and paid for luxury travel  Reporters

Ugarte and Eduardo Verdugo, and longtime AP freelancers Christian Chavez, Felix Marquez and Ivan Valencia ___The FAA investigates after Boeing says workers in South Carolina falsified 787 inspection recordsSEATTLE (AP) — The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it has opened an investigation into Boeing after the beleaguered company reported that workers at a South Carolina plant falsified inspection records on certain 787 planes  Boeing said its engineers have determined that misconduct did not create “an immediate safety of flight issue ”In an email to Boeing's South Carolina employees on April 29, Scott Stocker, who leads the 787 program, said a worker observed an “irregularity” in a required test of the wing-to-body join and reported it to his manager “After receiving the report, we quickly reviewed the matter and learned that several people had been violating Company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed,” Stocker wrote Boeing notified the FAA and is taking “swift and serious corrective action with multiple teammates,” Stocker said No planes have been taken out of service, but having to perform the test out of order on planes will slow the delivery of jets still being built at the final assembly plant in North Charleston, South Carolina ___Donald Trump calls Joe Biden weak on antisemitism, ignoring his own rhetoricNEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump is accusing Joe Biden of offering a weak response to antisemitism, wielding the clashes on colleges campuses over the war in Gaza as a campaign issue  But Trump's attacks ignore his own long history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews and politics The latest example came over the weekend, when Trump — accusing the White House of having a role in his multiple state and federal criminal prosecutions — told Republican donors gathered for a private retreat at his Florida resort that Biden is running a “Gestapo administration,” referring to the secret police force of Nazi Germany Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, called it a “deliberate tactic” to attack Biden and distract from his own track record “It’s wholly aligned with his long history of offensive and irresponsible comments when it comes to the Jewish community, including the normalization of antisemitism,” Spitalnick said Biden’s campaign called it “despicable” and an attack on law enforcement ___How a beach trip in Mexico's Baja California turned deadly for surfers from Australia and the USMEXICO CITY (AP) — Two Australians and an American were doing what they loved on the stunning, largely isolated stretch of Baja California's Pacific coast  Their last images on social media showed them sitting and gazing at the waves, contemplating the breaks What happened to end their lives may have been as random as a passing pickup truck full of people with ill intent  The surfers were shot in the head, their bodies dumped in a covered well miles away  How it unfolded was the stuff of nightmares Brothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad had apparently stopped to surf the breaks between Punta San José, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Ensenada, and La Bocana, further north on the coast  They were attacked there on April 28 or 29 As soon as police arrived at their last known camp site, it was clear that something had gone violently wrong There were bloodstains and marks “as if heavy objects had been dragged," leading to suspicions of an attack, the Baja California state prosecutor's office said in an attempt to reconstruct the scene ___American soldier was arrested in Russia and accused of stealing from a girlfriend, US officials sayWASHINGTON (AP) — An American soldier visiting a girlfriend in Russia's port city of Vladivostok was arrested on charges of stealing from her and remains in custody, according to several U S  officials U S  officials said Monday the soldier, Staff Sgt  Gordon Black, 34, was stationed in South Korea and was in the process of returning home to Fort Cavazos in Texas  Instead, officials said that Black, who is married, traveled to Russia to see a longtime girlfriend  His arrest only further complicates U S  relations with Russia, which have grown increasingly tense as the war in Ukraine drags on The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel details Cynthia Smith, Army spokeswoman, confirmed that a soldier was detained on Thursday in Vladivostok, a major military and commercial Pacific port, on charges of criminal misconduct  She said Russia notified the U S  and the Army told the soldier's family  “The U S  Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the soldier in Russia,” Smith said ___The Met Gala was in full bloom with Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Mindy Kaling among the standout starsNEW YORK (AP) — The Met Gala and
