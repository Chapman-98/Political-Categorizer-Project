One-fifty?”Trump can be heard suggesting that the payment be made with cash, prompting Cohen to object by saying “no” four times  Trump can then be heard saying “check" before the recording cuts off Trump’s lawyers sought earlier in the day to blunt the potential harm of Davidson’s testimony by getting him to acknowledge that he never had any interactions with Trump — only Cohen  In fact, Davidson said, he had never been in the same room as Trump until his testimony He also said he was unfamiliar with the Trump Organization's record-keeping practices and that any impressions he had of Trump himself came through others “I had no personal interactions with Donald Trump  It either came from my clients, Mr  Cohen or some other source, but certainly not him,” Davidson said The line of questioning from Trump attorney Emil Bove appeared intended to cast Trump as removed from the negotiations and to suggest that Cohen was handling the hush-money matters on his own Bove also noted that Davidson had been involved in similar payments for clients that had nothing to do with presidential politics, grilling him about previous instances in which he solicited money to suppress embarrassing stories, including one involving wrestler Hulk Hogan By the time Davidson negotiated hush money payments for McDougal and Daniels, Bove asked Davidson whether he was “pretty well versed in coming right up to the line without committing extortion, right?”“I had familiarized myself with the law,” Davidson replied Earlier Thursday, jurors viewed a confidential agreement requiring Daniels to keep quiet about her claims that she had a tryst with the married Trump a decade earlier  The agreement, dated less than two weeks before the 2016 presidential election, called for her to receive $130,000 in exchange for her silence The money was paid by Cohen, and the agreement referred to both Trump and Daniels with pseudonyms: David Dennison and Peggy Peterson “It is understood and agreed that the true name and identity of the person referred to as ‘DAVID DENNISON’ in the Settlement Agreement is Donald Trump,” the document stated, with Trump’s name written in by hand After the payment was made, Trump’s company reimbursed Cohen and logged the payments to him as legal expenses, prosecutors have said in charging the former president with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records — a charge punishable by up to four years in prison While testifying Thursday, Davidson also recalled Cohen ranting to him about Trump in a phone conversation about a month after the 2016 election, complaining that he had been passed over for a job in the new administration and that Trump had yet to reimburse him for the Daniels payment He also recalled Cohen telling him that he and Trump were “very upset” when The Wall Street Journal published an article that exposed a separate $150,000 National Enquirer arrangement with McDougal, who has said she and Trump had an affair, just days before the election “He wanted to know who the source of the article was, why someone would be the source of this type of article  He was upset by the timing," Davidson said of Cohen  "He stated his boss was very upset, and he threatened to sue Karen McDougal ”Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied relationships with either woman, as well as any wrongdoing in the case Before the start of testimony, prosecutors requested $1,000 fines for each of four comments by Trump that they say violated a judge's gag order barring him from attacking witnesses, jurors and others closely connected to the case  Such a penalty would be on top of a $9,000 fine that Judge Juan M  Merchan imposed Tuesday related to nine separate violations that he found Merchan did not immediately rule on the request for fresh sanctions, though he indicated he was not particularly concerned about one of the four statements flagged by prosecutors The prospect of further punishment underscores the challenges Trump the presidential candidate faces in adjusting to the role of criminal defendant subject to rigid courtroom protocol that he does not control  It also remains to be seen whether any rebuke from the court will lead Trump to adjust his behavior given the campaign trail benefit he believes he derives from painting the case as politically motivated
