unclearWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday appeared likely to reject former President Donald Trump’s claim of absolute immunity from prosecution over election interference, but several justices signaled reservations about the charges that could cause a lengthy delay, possibly beyond November’s election A majority of the justices did not appear to embrace the claim of absolute immunity that would stop special counsel Jack Smith's prosecution of Trump on charges he conspired to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden  But in arguments lasting more than 2 1/2 hours in the court’s first consideration of criminal charges against a former president, several conservative justices indicated they could limit when former presidents might be prosecuted, suggesting that the case might have to be sent back to lower courts before any trial could begin Justice Samuel Alito said that “whatever we decide is going to apply to all future presidents ”The timing of the Supreme Court’s decision could be as important as the outcome  Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has been pushing to delay the trial until after the election, and the later the justices issue their decision, the more likely he is to succeed  If Trump regains the presidency, he could order the Justice Department to dismiss the case, or possibly, as two justices suggested, pardon himself if convicted Since conservatives on the court gained a supermajority with the confirmation of three Trump appointees, they have cast aside decades-old long precedent on abortion and affirmation action  Now Trump is asking them to rule that one of the fundamental tenets of the American system of government — that no person is above the law -- should be rejected as well, at least as it applies to him ___The National Enquirer was the go-to American tabloid for many years  Donald Trump helped change thatNEW YORK (AP) — Catch and kill  Checkbook journalism  Secret deals  Friends helping friends Even by National Enquirer standards, testimony by its former publisher David Pecker at Donald Trump's hush money trial this week has revealed an astonishing level of corruption at America's best-known tabloid and may one day be seen as the moment it effectively died “It just has zero credibility,” said Lachlan Cartwright, executive editor of the Enquirer from 2014 to 2017  “Whatever sort of credibility it had was totally damaged by what happened in court this week ”On Thursday, Pecker was back on the witness stand to tell more about the arrangement he made to boost Trump's presidential candidacy in 2016, tear down his rivals and silence any revelations that may have damaged him However its stories danced on the edge of credulity, the Enquirer was a cultural fixture, in large part because of genius marketing  As many Americans moved to the suburbs in the 1960s, the tabloid staked its place on racks at supermarket checkout lines, where people could see headlines about UFO abductions or medical miracles while waiting for their milk and bread to be bagged ___Harvey Weinstein’s rape conviction is overturned by New York's top courtNEW YORK (AP) — New York’s highest court on Thursday threw out Harvey Weinstein ’s 2020 rape conviction with a ruling that shocked and disappointed women who celebrated historic gains during the #MeToo era and left those who testified in the case bracing for a retrial against the ex-movie mogul The court found the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren’t part of the case Weinstein, 72, will remain in prison because he was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape  But the New York ruling reopens a painful chapter in America’s reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures — an era that began in 2017 with a flood of allegations against Weinstein #MeToo advocates noted that Thursday's ruling was based on legal technicalities and not an exoneration of Weinstein's behavior, saying the original trial irrevocably moved the cultural needle on attitudes about sexual assault The Manhattan district attorney’s office said it intends to retry Weinstein, and at least one of his accusers said through her lawyer that she would testify again ___These people were charged with interfering in the 2020 election  Some are still in politics todayATLANTA (AP) — As Donald Trump seeks a return to the White House, criminal charges are piling up for the people who tried to help him stay there in 2020 by promoting false theories of voter fraud At least five states won in 2020 by President Joe Biden have investigated efforts to install slates of electors who would cast Electoral College votes for Trump despite his loss  Those slates were to be used by Trump allies in the House and Senate to justify delaying or blocking the certification of the election during the joint session of Congress on Jan  6, 2021, which was disrupted by pro-Trump rioters storming the Capitol Several of those charged or accused of involvement in election interference across the states are still involved in Republican politics today — including the lawyer overseeing “election integrity” for the Republican National Committee  And Trump, who faces federal charges in Washington and state charges in Georgia for his efforts to overturn Biden's win, frequently still claims the 2020 election was stolen, a falsehood echoed by many of his supporters Here's a look at the sprawling web of allegations, criminal charges and references to people in Trump’s orbit as unindicted co-conspirators The former president faces state charges in Georgia and federal charges in Washington over efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and has been identified as an unindicted co-conspirator by investigators in Arizona and Michigan ___USC cancels graduation ceremony and dozens are arrested on other campuses as anti-war protests growThe University of Southern California canceled its main graduation ceremony Thursday and dozens of students were arrested on other campuses as protests against the Israel-Hamas war continued to spread College officials across the U S  are worried the ongoing protests could disrupt their plans for commencement ceremonies next month  Some universities called in police to break up the demonstrations, resulting in ugly scuffles and arrests, while others appeared content to wait out student protests as the final days of the semester ticked down Other approaches taken by schools included rewriting their rules to ban encampments and moving final exams to new locations USC announced the cancellation of the May 10 ceremony a day after more than 90 protesters were arrested on campus  The university said it will still host dozens of commencement events, including all the traditional individual school commencement ceremonies, during which students cross a stage and receive their diplomas Tensions were already high after the university canceled a planned commencement speech by the school’s pro-Palestinian valedictorian, citing safety concerns ___Hamas again raises the possibility of a 2-state compromise  Israel and its allies aren't convincedThe Palestinian militant group Hamas has said for more than 15 years that it could accept a two-state compromise with Israel — at least, a temporary one  But Hamas has also refused to say that it would recognize Israel or renounce its armed fight against it For Israel and many others, especially in the wake of Hamas' Oct  7 attack that spurred the latest war in Gaza, that’s proof that Hamas is still irrevocably bent on destroying Israel  The United States and European countries have joined Israel in shunning the militant group they have labeled a terrorist organization For some observers, Hamas has signaled a potential pragmatism that could open a path to a solution  But the group’s vagueness as it tries to square the circle of its own positions has fueled suspicion Hamas offers long-term “truces” instead of outright peace  It has dropped open pledges to destroy Israel but endorses “armed resistance” — and says it will fight for liberation of all “the land of Palestine ”In the latest iteration of its stance, senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday the group would lay down its weapons and convert into a political party if an independent Palestinian state is established in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip along the pre-1967-borders ___A US-led effort to bring aid to Gaza by sea is moving forward  But big concerns remainJERUSALEM (AP) — The construction of a new port in Gaza and an accompanying U S  military-built pier offshore are underway, but the complex plan to bring more desperately needed food to Palestinian civilians is still mired in fears over security and how the humanitarian aid will be delivered The Israeli-developed port, for example, has already been attacked by mortar fire, sending high-ranking U N  officials scrambling for shelter this week, and there is still no solid decision on when the aid deliveries will actually begin While satellite photos show major port construction along the shore near Gaza City, aid groups are making it clear that they have broad concerns about their safety and reservations about how Israeli forces will handle security Sonali Korde, an official with the U S  Agency for International Development, said key agreements for security and handling the aid deliveries are still being negotiated  Those include how Israeli forces will operate in Gaza to ensure that aid workers are not harmed “We need to see steps implemented  And the humanitarian community and IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) continue to talk and engage and iterate and improve the system so that everyone feels safe and secure in this very difficult operating environment,” Korde said ___Tennessee lawmakers OK bill criminalizing adults who help minors receive gender-affirming careNASHVILLE, Tenn  (AP) — Tennessee's GOP-controlled Statehouse on Thursday gave their final approval to legislation criminalizing adults who help minors receive gender-affirming care without parental consent, clearing the way for the first-in-the-nation proposal to be sent to Gov  Bill Lee's desk for his signature The bill mirrors almost the same language from a so-called “anti-abortion trafficking” proposal Tennessee Republican lawmakers approved just a day prior  In that version, supporters are hoping to stop adults from helping young people obtain abortions without permission from their parents or guardians Lee, a Republican, hasn't publicly commented on either bill but supporters are confident the governor will sign them into law  Lee eagerly approved both the state's sweeping abortion ban and the state's ban on gender-affirming care for children  He has also never issued a veto during his time as governor While the Republican supermajority touted the proposed statutes necessary to protect parental rights, critics warned about the possible broad application  Violations could range from talking to an adolescent about a website on where to find care to helping that young person travel to another state with looser restrictions on gender-affirming care services According to the Human Rights Campaign, Tennessee has enacted more anti-LGBTQ+ laws more than any other state since 2015, identifying more than 20 bills that advanced out of the Legislature over the past few months ___Ariel Henry resigns as prime minister of Haiti, paving the way for a new government to take powerPORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Haiti opened a new political chapter Thursday with the installation of a transitional council tasked to pick a new prime minister and prepare for eventual presidential elections, in hopes of quelling spiraling gang violence that has killed thousands in the Caribbean country Ariel Henry, the prime minister who had been locked out of the country for the past couple of months due to the violence, cleared the way for the transition by presenting his resignation in a letter signed in Los Angeles The document was released Thursday in Haiti on the same day as the new transitional council was sworn in to choose a new prime minister and Cabinet  Henry's outgoing Cabinet chose Eonomy and Finance Minister Michel Patrick Boisvert as interim prime minister in the meantime  It was not immediately clear when the transitional council would name its own choice for interim prime minister Addressing a crowded and sweaty room in the prime minister's office, Boisvert said that Haiti's crisis had gone on too long and that the country now found itself at a crossroads  The members of the transitional council stood behind him, and before him, the country's top police and military officials as well as ambassadors and well-known politicians “After long months of debate     a solution has been found,” Boisvert said  “Today is an important day in the life of our dear republic ”___What do weight loss drugs mean for a diet industry built on eating less and exercising more?NEW YORK (AP) — Ever since college, Brad Jobling struggled with his weight, fluctuating between a low of 155 pounds when he was in his 30s to as high as 220  He spent a decade tracking calories on WeightWatchers, but the pounds he dropped always crept back onto his 5-foot-5-inch frame A little over a year ago, the 58-year-old Manhattan resident went on a new weight loss drug called Wegovy  He's lost 30 pounds, and has started eating healthier food and exercising — the habits behind many commercial diet plans and decades of conventional wisdom on sustainable weight loss Yet Jobling's experience also has altered his perspective on dieting  He now sees obesity as a disease that requires medical intervention, not just behavioral changes  In fact, he thinks he will need to stay on a drug like Wegovy for the rest of his life even though it has taken some of the joy out of eating “I don't see how you can maintain (the weight) without medication,” Jobling said  “Obviously, it’s all about self-control  But I think it’s less of a struggle to really maintain healthy eating when you got that assistance ”Like the lives of the people taking them, recent injected drugs like Wegovy and its predecessor, the diabetes medication Ozempic, are reshaping the U S  health and fitness industries  They have proven successful in eliminating unwanted pounds more quickly and easily than consuming fewer and burning more calories alone  Such is their disruptive power that even established diet companies like WeightWatchers and brands like Lean Cuisine are getting makeovers
