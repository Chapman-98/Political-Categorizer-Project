Symone Sanders?” he asked, citing two former Biden administration officials working at MSNBC Yet McDaniel's role in supporting Trump and some of his comments about the 2020 election, and the speed of her switch to a media job after being forced out of the RNC by Trump, attracted particular attention  The phrase #BoycottNBCNews was trending on X Sunday McDaniel's interview on Sunday's “Meet the Press” had been booked prior to the announcement that she'd been hired by the network During the interview, McDaniel acknowledged that Biden won the 2020 election “fair and square ” That was a reversal from a comment she made on CNN last summer, when she said “I don't think he won it fair  I don't ”On Sunday, she said, “the reality is Joe Biden won  He's the president  He's the legitimate president  I have always said, and I continue to say, there were issues in 2020  I believe that both can be true ”Under questioning from Welker, McDaniel said Sunday that she disagreed with Trump's contention that people jailed for their part in the Jan  6, 2021, attack on the Capitol should be freed “Why not speak out earlier?” Welker asked “When you're the RNC chair you kind of take one for the whole team, right?” McDaniel said  “Now I get to be a little bit more myself, right? This is what I believe ”___Associated Press writer Jonathan J  Cooper in Phoenix contributed to this report ___David Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press  Follow him at http://twitter com/dbauder
