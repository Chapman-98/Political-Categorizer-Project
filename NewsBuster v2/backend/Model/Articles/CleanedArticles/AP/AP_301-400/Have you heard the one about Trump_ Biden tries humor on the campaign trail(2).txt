He suggested: Inject a little bleach in your vein,” Biden said Wednesday to a labor union, describing Trump's guidance from the White House during the pandemic  “He missed  It all went to his hair ”In Tampa, Florida, the day before, he assailed Trump for the Supreme Court's ruling that overturned abortion protections — with three justices nominated by Trump voting in the majority of Dobbs v  Jackson Women’s Health Organization — and then pivoted to the former president's hawking of a $60 “God Bless the USA” Bible “He described the Dobbs decision as a ‘miracle,’” Biden said of Trump  “Maybe it’s coming from that Bible he’s trying to sell  Whoa  I almost wanted to buy one just to see what the hell is in it ”Biden rarely references Trump's court cases, but jokes about financial problems that began soon after the former president was ordered to pay $454 million in a civil case in New York "Just the other day," Biden said at a fundraiser in Dallas last month, “a defeated-looking guy came up to me and said, ‘Mr  President, I need your help  I’m being crushed with debt  I’m completely wiped out ’ I had to say, 'Donald, I can’t help you '”Even when Biden tries his hand at humor, he rarely strays far from talking about policies  He likes to note that he signed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law — after his opponent failed to do so despite repeatedly holding White House events to drum up support for an idea that never materialized “He promised ‘Infrastructure Week’ every week for four years and never built a damn thing,” Biden said this month to a group of laughing union members The dilemma is that Trump, who tells voters the whole American political system is hopelessly corrupt, can get away with name-calling that would backfire on other candidates  During his rallies, Trump imitates Biden as a feeble old man who cannot find the stairs after giving a brief speech, and he calls the president “crooked” and “a demented tyrant ”The Republican's campaign said the insults will only intensify as Biden tries to give them a taste of their own medicine Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, said Biden is “shuffling his feet like a short-circuited Roomba,” referring to the robot vacuum, while failing to address the “out-of-control border” and “runaway inflation ”Rick Tyler, who worked on the presidential campaign of Sen  Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2016, said voters have a double standard because expectations are different for Trump, who first became famous as a real estate developer and the star of the reality TV show “The Apprentice ”“Celebrities don’t really have standards, and Trump is in that lane,“ Tyler said  For a politician going up against Trump, "it’s like trying to play a sport with the wrong equipment ”Sen  Marco Rubio, R-Fla , found that out the hard way in the Republican primary in 2016  After Rubio joked about Trump having “small hands” — suggesting that another part of him was small, too — Trump swung back by saying, “I guarantee you there’s no problem ”“Nobody has ever beaten Trump by getting in the ring with him,” said Alex Conant, communications director for Rubio's campaign Karen Finney, who advised Democrat Hillary Clinton in her 2016 White House run, said Trump can bait opponents into "communicating on his terms, not your terms ”“It’s the kind of thing where you have to have a balance," she said  "You could spend all day just responding ”But if Trump's humor is blunt, Biden sometimes tries to get the most mileage by staying subtle  During a Pittsburgh stop earlier this month, Biden spoke elliptically about Trump's trial, betting his audience was already in on the joke Trump, he said, is “a little busy right now ”
