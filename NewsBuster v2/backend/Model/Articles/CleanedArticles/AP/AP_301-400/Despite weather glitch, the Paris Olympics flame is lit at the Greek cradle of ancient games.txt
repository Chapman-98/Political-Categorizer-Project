something that is unifying; something that gives us hope ”Thousands of spectators from all over the world packed Olympia for Tuesday's event amid the ruined temples and sports grounds where the ancient games were held from 776 B C -393 A D The sprawling site, in a lush valley by the confluence of two rivers, is at its prettiest in the spring, teeming with pink-flowering Judas trees, small blue irises and the occasional red anemone Greek authorities maintained high security around Olympia on Tuesday, after protests by rights activists disrupted the lighting ceremonies for the Beijing summer and winter games  Armed police stopped incoming vehicles and checked for explosives, while sniffer dogs combed the grounds The first torchbearer was Greek rower Stefanos Douskos, a gold medalist in 2021 in Tokyo  He ran to a nearby monument that contains the heart of French Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the driving force behind the modern revival of the games The next runner was Laure Manaudou, a French swimmer who won three medals at Athens in 2004  She handed over to senior European Union official Margaritis Schinas, a Greek The IOC's Bach praised Paris organizers for doing “an outstanding job” with preparations for the July 26-August 11 games He also highlighted their environmental impact, saying that cleanup efforts will make it possible to swim in the River Seine, which traverses Paris, “for the first time in a hundred years ”IOC politics briefly reared their head in Olympia as well, with the heads of two sports federations criticizing track and field leader Sebastian Coe for breaking with Olympic tradition last week by promising prize money of $50,000 to each of its gold medalists in Paris  The money will be paid from the share of Olympic games revenues that the IOC pays governing bodies of Olympic sports International Cycling Union President David Lappartient complained that Coe did not consult with other sports before announcing his move “We really believe that that’s not the Olympic spirit,” Lappartient said  “If we concentrate the money     on only top athletes, only gold, then of course a lot of opportunities will disappear for athletes all over the world ”Coe has been widely expected to run for the IOC presidency, which should become vacant in 2025  Lappartient is close to Bach and is increasingly seen as a potential successor From Greece, the Olympic flame will travel from Athens' port of Piraeus on the Belem, a French three-masted sailing ship built in 1896 — the year of the first modern games in Athens According to Captain Aymeric Gibet, it's due on May 8 in the southern French port of Marseille, a city founded by Greek colonists some 2,600 years ago The Belem arrived in Katakolo, near Olympia, on Monday  Lookers-on included a small, enthusiastic group of tourists from the northwestern French region of Brittany, where the ship's homeport of Nantes is, waving French and Breton flags “We thought it would be a unique opportunity to see the flame lighting at the historic site of Olympia,” said Jean-Michel Pasquet from Lorient, near Nantes  “And when we also learnt the Belem would carry the flame     we said we must do this ”But Pasquet said he'd have to watch the Paris Games from home “For us, it would be really very expensive, unaffordable,” to go to the venues, he said  “So we'll watch them on television     from our armchairs ”___Graham Dunbar in Geneva, Switzerland, and Theodora Tongas in Ancient Olympia contributed ___AP Olympics https://apnews com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games
