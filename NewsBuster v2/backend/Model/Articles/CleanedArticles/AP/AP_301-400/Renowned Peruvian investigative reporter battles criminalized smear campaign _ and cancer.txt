$29 million went to Peruvian officials from 2005-2014, according to the U S  Justice Department To unearth its machinations outside Brazil, Gorriti recruited reporters from multiple countries and personally traveled there  Ensuing prosecutions have varied by country  If not for pressure from Gorriti’s team and other journalists, the Peruvian cases might have faltered, said Pérez, the anti-corruption prosecutor “In 2017, the chief prosecutor's office didn't want to investigate Keiko Fujimori,” he added Gorriti won hero status, standing ovations at book fairs and hugs in the street But with Lava Jato cases now coming to a head – every elected 21st-century Peruvian president is implicated – gatherings outside Gorriti’s home and IDL Reporteros offices have taken on a different, sinister tone: Street toughs hurling insults and even bagged excrement The probe of Gorriti was solicited by an unusual alliance of the party of Keiko Fujimori and its longtime nemesis, that of former President Alan García Ensnared in the Odebrecht scandal over rail projects, García shot himself in the head in 2019 rather than surrender to police after Uruguay's embassy denied him refuge  His loyalists claim Gorriti and the anti-corruption prosecutors "criminally entrapped” him That's absurd, says Gorriti  After the suicide, reporters determined that García told friends and family he would take his life to avoid the public humiliation The frenzy of demands for Gorriti’s head flow from unsubstantiated tales slung by Jaime Villanueva, a former adviser to a suspended chief national prosecutor Villanueva unleashed the accusations after coming under investigation for alleged crimes including bribery and influence-trafficking and agreed to testify against his former boss in exchange for favorable treatment  Neither he nor the prosecutor who launched the investigation against Gorriti, Alcides Chanchay, responded to AP interview requests After working with then-chief prosecutor Patricia Benavides to try to choke anti-corruption efforts, Villanueva counseled lawmakers on crippling judicial independence, Gorriti says  “The guy had a trajectory Judas Iscariot would have envied ”Gorriti has a knack for stirring hornet's nests While exiled in Panama, then-President Ernesto Balladares tried to expel Gorriti in 1997 after investigations he led at the local newspaper La Prensa uncovered high-level corruption including trafficking in Chinese workers “Generally, Latin politicians don’t care if you call them thieves, tyrants, shameless, God’s punishment, whatever," Gorriti told the AP at the time  "What matters a lot to them is substantive journalism  They’re not accustomed to it ”In the citation for a 1998 press freedom award, the Committee to Protect Journalists called Gorriti “Latin America's top investigative reporter ”International pressure could certainly help now  Gorriti is regaining strength after good results from immunotherapy begun in February  His hair has mostly grown back  But the relative silence of Peruvians worries him They generally despise the president, Dina Boluarte, and Congress  Polls show more than nine in 10 want them gone  But political gridlock has delayed new elections  Pedro Castillo, the last elected president, was impeached in 2022 for trying to dissolve Congress  Troops then killed at least 40 people in ensuing protests Peruvians are demoralized by all the corruption and still addled from the COVID-19 pandemic, Gorriti says  No country suffered a higher per-capital death rate  And they've had six presidents in six years Gorriti, who published a book about the Shining Path insurgency in 1990, believes that just as Peruvians have failed to reckon with the group's rise so have they avoided examining their inadequacies in confronting the pandemic In the late 1990s, they rallied to drive a disgraced and discredited Alberto Fujimori into exile  He and his intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos have since been convicted of multiple felonies – including in the 1992 Gorriti abduction If Gorriti were to wind up jailed, perhaps Peruvians might again be stirred to action Suppressing an intermittent cough, Gorriti expressed hope his case can mark a milestone for freedom of expression and democracy As he told Colombian journalist Maria Jimena Duzan in a recent podcast, “If I need to do battle in my old age, well, so be it  Old folks can fight, too ”___Frank Bajak was AP’s chief of Andean news from 2006-2016 ___Associated Press writer Franklin Briceno contributed to this report
