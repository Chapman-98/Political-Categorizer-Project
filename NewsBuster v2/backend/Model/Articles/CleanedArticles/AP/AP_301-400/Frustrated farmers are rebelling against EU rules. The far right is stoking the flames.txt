Don't Let Up!”FERTILE GROUNDFarming in Europe is about more than just food; it touches on identity  In France, the far right taps into the love of “terroir,” that mythical combination of soil, location, culture and climate “The French realize that the farmers are the roots of our society," said Maréchal Such sentiments echo across Europe  In Ireland, where more than a million people died in the famine of 1845-1852, farming "is deep in our culture, in our psyche,” said Environment Minister Eamon Ryan, a Green Party lawmaker The far right has used farming as a way to attack mainstream parties  In Italy, the far right has mocked the EU's efforts to promote a low-carbon diet, playing on farmers' fears that lab-grown proteins and insects could one day replace meat “Revolt is the language of those who are not listened to  Now, back off,” warned far-right Italian lawmaker Nicola Procaccini in February  In a few months, he said, the European elections "will put people back in place of ideologies ”Such calls fall on fertile ground  According to predictions by the European Council on Foreign Relations, the radical right Identity and Democracy group could become the third biggest overall in the next European Parliament, behind the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, but edging out the Liberals and Greens  The farm protests are providing vital leverage A SPADE IS A SPADEOne farmer sidestepping militant demonstrations is Bart Dochy in western Belgium  As the Christian Democrat mayor of the farming town of Ledegem and a regional parliamentarian in Flanders, he represents the traditional forces in European farming communities: Christianity and conservativism  When Socialism took the big cities, the countryside and its farmers remained staunchly Christian Democrat That's now changed  Once, billboards with the cry, “Save our farmers!” would have come from his party; now, they bear the logo of the far-right Flemish Interest, predicted by polls to become the biggest party in Belgium in June “In a sense it is only logical that the extreme parties have specialized in capturing that discontent  They call a spade a spade  And that is good,” he said  But farming is complicated, he warned: nature, trade, budgets, commodity prices and geopolitics are all involved  Solutions will have to come from common sense, "not from the extremes ”Dochy's Christian Democrats are part of the biggest group in the EU parliament, the European People's Party, once a strong proponent of the EU's Green Deal  Farmers, after all, are among the biggest losers from climate change, affected at different times by flooding, wildfires, drought and extreme temperatures But ever since the demonstrations started, EU politics on agriculture and climate have shifted rightwards, outraging many of the center right’s old allies with whom it set up the Green Deal  Measures to reduce pesticide use and protect biodiversity have been weakened, while the protesters' demands to cut regulation have been heard But as the rhetoric heats up, so too does the climate  Data for early 2024 shows record-breaking temperatures in Europe  In Greece — where an estimated 1,750 square kilometers (675 square miles) burned in 2023, the worst fire in EU records — wildfires are already breaking out, weeks earlier than expected The far right offers no detailed solutions to the climate crisis but it has proved adept at tapping into farmers’ frustrations  In its program for the June elections, the Dutch far-right party, the PVV, is short on details but big on slogans about “climate hysteria” and its “tsunami of rules ” Nature and climate laws, it said, “should not lead to whole sectors being forced into bankruptcy ”Ubels made the case for farmers' realpolitik “The government doesn't listen to us, but the opposition does,” he said
