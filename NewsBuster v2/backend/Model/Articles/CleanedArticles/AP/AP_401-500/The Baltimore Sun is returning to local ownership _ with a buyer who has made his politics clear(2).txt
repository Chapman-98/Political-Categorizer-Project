Rupert Murdoch is only a recent example  What resonates is whether they use their products to push those views “If the owner invests in it and truly cares about local news and how it is reported fairly, it could be a great thing,” said Marty Kaiser, who worked at the Sun decades ago and now runs the Capital News Service for the University of Maryland  “But his background sort of makes you pause ”Alden Capital, the investment firm that took control of the Sun with its purchase of Tribune Publishing in 2021, is notorious for its cost-cutting  Newspapers with local ownership — the Philadelphia Inquirer, Boston Globe and Seattle Times among them — tend to invest more in their product, said Tim Franklin, senior director of the Medill Local News Initiative at Northwestern University But while the Sun has shrunk, it has remained a credible news organization, winning the Pulitzer Prize for local reporting in 2020 for its stories on a book publishing scheme that led to the former mayor’s resignation It is also now competing with The Baltimore Banner, a digital-only news organization started in 2022 by hotel magnate Stewart Bainum Jr , who tried unsuccessfully to buy the Sun before launching his startup  The Banner employs more than 75 journalists — about 20% hired directly from the Sun over the past two years While the region certainly has people with conservative views, turning it into a rigid conservative publication would not seem a wise business decision, said Medill’s Franklin, who was editor-in-chief of the Sun from 2004 to 2009  “One of the most important rules is to know your audience,” Franklin said, “and Baltimore is not a conservative area ”Smith has exhibited a pointed attitude toward the business he’s getting into  In 2018, Smith told New York magazine that he dislikes and fundamentally distrusts print media  He said the industry is so left wing as to be meaningless and that accounts for its decline  “Just no credibility,” he told writer Olivia Nuzzi in 2018 When asked about those comments by a Sun staffer Tuesday during a contentious meeting that left many staff members feeling depleted, Smith said he largely stood by them, according to people in attendance David Simon, a former Sun journalist who later gained fame as creator of television’s “The Wire,” said Tuesday that The Sun was already a “hollow shell” of its former self before the recent sale “There are no great cities without great news organizations,” Simon wrote on X, formerly Twitter, “and absent an entity that truly covers its region independently and without ideological cant, corruption and grift will be unceasing ”Baltimore Sun Media, winner of 16 Pulitzer Prizes, employs more than 150 people and publishes seven other publications aside from the Sun, with more than 230,000 paid subscribers total  The largest newspaper in Maryland, the Sun was founded in 1837 and was locally owned by the Abell family until the 1980s ___Bauder, AP’s media writer, reported from New York  Skene reported from Baltimore
