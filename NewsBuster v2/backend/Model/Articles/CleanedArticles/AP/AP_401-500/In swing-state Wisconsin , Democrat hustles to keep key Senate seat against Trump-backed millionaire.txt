No," Hovde said  “Do I think there were troubling and challenging things? Yeah  So let’s clean them up ”Hovde said that while he agrees with Trump on “most of his policies,” he will not “engage in the politics of personal destruction ”“I’m committed to trying to bring our country together,” Hovde said, striking a different tone from Trump who has referred to Biden as a “lunatic" and labeled the president's supporters as “thugs" at the Green Bay rally “We have become way too divisive as a country," Hovde told AP  "We need to heal  I’m willing to cooperate, reach across the aisle ”Hovde's message is shaped to appeal to the small, but crucial, bloc of independent voters in Wisconsin who typically decide close elections In his 2020 defeat, Trump lost support in the Milwaukee suburbs and other conservative strongholds, like the Fox Valley and Green Bay  Democrats have built their run of 14 victories in the past 17 statewide elections by eating into those Republican areas while driving up turnout in Madison and Milwaukee Hovde knows he must improve on Trump's margins in the suburbs, while also dampening the Democratic advantage in urban areas  He's already advertising on television in Madison and Milwaukee, the state's two largest cities “I think it’s a mistake when Republican candidates don’t compete in Milwaukee and Madison,” Hovde said  “So I’m spending a lot of time on both these markets and will compete hard ”In 2018, Baldwin cruised to an 11-point victory, a whopping margin in a state where four of the past six presidential races have been decided by less than a point  In that same 2018 election, Democrat Tony Evers defeated then-Gov  Scott Walker by just over 1 point Baldwin's strategy that year, seen as a model for Democrats ever since, was to compete everywhere, including rural areas Baldwin said during a tour of New Glarus Brewing Company that it is “critical” for her to show up all over the state  In 2020, Biden carried Green County, where New Glarus is located, by just 662 votes She hit numerous smaller towns and cities during her 19-county, 1,400-mile “Dairyland” launch tour, taking a boat ride in the tourism hub of Wisconsin Dells and meeting with tribal leaders in Ashland Baldwin's attack on Hovde, who is CEO of H Bancorp and its primary subsidiary, Utah-based Sunwest Bank, is that he's trying to buy the Senate seat Hovde has largely cleared the GOP primary field with his deep pockets Another wealthy businessman, Scott Mayer, opted in March against a run  Former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, a staunch Trump supporter who brands himself as “America’s Sheriff” on the conservative speaking circuit, has toyed with a run but not committed Last week Clarke teased a “big announcement,” but it turned out to be a book giveaway Hovde was born and raised in Wisconsin but also owns a $7 million estate in Laguna Beach, California  He has tried to laugh off the accusation that he’s more California than Wisconsin, posting a video of himself shirtless, submerged in a frigid Madison lake in February, challenging Baldwin to prove her Wisconsin bona fides and do the same  She declined Hovde also said he got donations from more than 2,000 Wisconsin residents in the first month after his campaign launch In addition to painting Hovde as an out-of-touch outsider, Baldwin once again hopes abortion fuels Democratic turnout as it did in last year's Wisconsin Supreme Court race, won by the liberal candidate, and the 2022 midterm Vice President Kamala Harris came to the conservative Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha in January to talk about abortion rights, one in a series of stops she and Biden have made in Wisconsin  The president was due back in Madison on Monday for his 10th trip to Wisconsin as president Hovde said he supported the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v  Wade in 2022, but in another break with Trump, told AP that he would not vote for a federal law banning abortion, saying states should decide  Trump has suggested he would support a federal ban  He also said that “there’s a reasonable time in a woman’s pregnancy to make a choice,” but did not specify how late into a pregnancy that should be That is a change of his position from 2012, when he last ran for Senate as someone “totally opposed” to abortion Hovde will have to win on the issues to have a chance, said longtime Republican strategist Bill McCoshen “Her constituent services is what makes her so strong,” McCoshen said  “She and her staff deliver  And she’ll have unconventional endorsements that would normally go to a Republican candidate "Baldwin's constituent work was on display at New Glarus Brewing, where co-owner Deb Carey praised Baldwin for fighting to lower the beer tax, in addition to supporting affordable health care and protecting Social Security “Tammy is a practical person that is from Wisconsin and she works hard for Wisconsin and has for many years,” Carey said  “She absolutely deserves to be reelected "Hovde should look to Baldwin's first Senate victory in 2012 over Tommy Thompson, the popular former four-term governor, for how to run this year's race, McCoshen said “Hovde’s got to give her voters permission to vote against her this time,” McCoshen said
