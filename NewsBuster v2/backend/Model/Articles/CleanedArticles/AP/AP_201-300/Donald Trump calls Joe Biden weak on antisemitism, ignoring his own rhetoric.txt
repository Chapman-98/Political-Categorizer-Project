I hope you’re listening, Israel  Hope you’re getting smart," Trump said Biden has said he condemns “the antisemitic protests” and last week, he broke days of silence and called for “order” after some schools cleared demonstrators by force, leading to clashes James Singer, a spokesperson for Biden’s campaign, said Biden stands against antisemitism but Trump does not “Trump has praised neo-Nazis, dined with neo-Nazis, echoed the rhetoric of neo-Nazis, and reportedly praised the accomplishments of Adolf Hitler,” Singer said in a statement  “He cannot lead us, so he seeks to divide us with the oldest of ideas – hate, anger, revenge, and retribution ”After white nationalists chanting “Jews will not replace us!” rallied in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 and clashed with anti-racism protesters, Trump drew some of his fiercest backlash as president when he said that there “ were very fine people, on both sides  ”Trump last week downplayed Charlottesville, saying the deadly rally was “nothing” compared to ongoing pro-Palestinian campus protests Not long after launching his third White House campaign in 2022, Trump drew widespread condemnation for having dinner at his Mar-a-Lago club with a Holocaust-denying white nationalist and the rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, shortly after he made weeks of antisemitic comments He’s drawn criticism on his third White House campaign for using language echoing that used by Adolf Hitler to argue that immigrants entering the U S  illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country,” and labeled his opponents as “vermin ”Trump has also been accused of promoting antisemitic tropes as he’s suggested that Jewish people who vote for Democrats “ hate Israel” and hate “their religion” are “very disloyal to Israel ” Critics have said the comments evoke the drop of dual loyalty, accusing Jews of being more loyal to their religion than their country After Trump's reference to “Gestapo” over the weekend, Jonathan Sarna, an American Jewish history professor at Brandeis University, said there are “great dangers” in the Nazi comparisons “Not only it’s historically incorrect, it’s morally offensive,” Sarna said  “The problem is looking to associate whatever you don’t like with the most evil forces, ignoring all the crucial differences  At that point, we forget what the Holocaust really was ”___Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in New York contributed to this report
