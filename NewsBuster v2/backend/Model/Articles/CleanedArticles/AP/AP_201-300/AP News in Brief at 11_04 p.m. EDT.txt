future'JERUSALEM — The latest round of Gaza cease-fire talks ended in Cairo after “in-depth and serious discussions,” the Hamas militant group said Sunday, reiterating key demands that Israel again rejected  After earlier signs of progress, the outlook appeared to dim as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to resist international pressure to halt the war Defense Minister Yoav Gallant claimed Hamas wasn't serious about a deal and warned of “a powerful operation in the very near future in Rafah and other places across all of Gaza " after Hamas attacked Israel's main crossing point for delivering badly needed humanitarian aid, killing three soldiers  Israel’s military said it believed Hamas was targeting soldiers massed on the Gaza border in preparation for a possible Rafah invasion  Hamas said it targeted soldiers in the area But Israeli media reported that CIA chief William Burns, a main mediator in the talks, would meet with Netanyahu on Monday  An official familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Burns was traveling to meet the prime minister of Qatar, which along with Egypt has been an intermediary dealing with Hamas  It was not clear whether a subsequent trip to Israel that had been planned would happen  The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations Israel didn’t send a delegation to the latest talks  Egyptian state media reported that the Hamas delegation went for discussions in Qatar, where the group has a political office, and will return to Cairo for further negotiations on Tuesday Another threat to talks came as Israel ordered the local offices of Qatar’s Al Jazeera satellite news network to close, accusing it of broadcasting anti-Israel incitement  The ban did not appear to affect the channel’s operations in Gaza or the West Bank ___Netanyahu uses Holocaust ceremony to brush off international pressure against Gaza offensiveJERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday rejected international pressure to halt the war in Gaza in a fiery speech marking the country’s annual Holocaust memorial day, declaring: “If Israel is forced to stand alone, Israel will stand alone ”The message, delivered in a setting that typically avoids politics, was aimed at the growing chorus of world leaders who have criticized the heavy toll caused by Israel’s military offensive against Hamas militants and have urged the sides to agree to a cease-fire Netanyahu has said he is open to a deal that would pause nearly seven months of fighting and bring home hostages held by Hamas  But he also says he remains committed to an invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, despite widespread international opposition because of the more than 1 million civilians huddled there “I say to the leaders of the world: No amount of pressure, no decision by any international forum will stop Israel from defending itself,” he said, speaking in English  “Never again is now ”Yom Hashoah, the day Israel observes as a memorial for the 6 million Jews killed by Nazi Germany and its allies in the Holocaust, is one of the most solemn dates on the country’s calendar  Speeches at the ceremony generally avoid politics, though Netanyahu in recent years has used the occasion to lash out at Israel's archenemy Iran ___Anti-war protesters leave USC after police arrive, while Northeastern ceremony proceeds calmlyStudents protesting the war in Gaza abandoned their camp at the University of Southern California early Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest, while Northeastern University's commencement ended peacefully at Boston's Fenway Park Developments in both places were being watched closely following scores of arrests last month — more than 90 people at USC in Los Angeles and about 100 at Northeastern in Boston Dozens of Los Angeles Police Department officers arrived about 4 a m  at USC to assist campus safety officers  The university had warned of arrests on social media and in person  Video showed some protesters packing up and leaving, while officers formed lines to push others away from the camp as it emptied out  The university said there were no reports of any arrests USC President Carol Folt said it was time to draw a line because “the occupation was spiraling in a dangerous direction” with areas of campus blocked and people being harassed “The operation was peaceful," Folt wrote in an update  “Campus is opening, students are returning to prepare for finals, and commencement set-up is in full swing ”___Denial and uncertainty are looming over a Biden-Trump rematch 6 months out from Election DayWILMINGTON, N C  (AP) — This North Carolina voter is nervous Will Rikard, a 49-year-old father of two, was among several hundred Democrats who stood and cheered for Joe Biden as the first-term president delivered a fiery speech recently about the billions of dollars he has delivered to protect the state's drinking water But afterward, the Wilmington resident acknowledged he is worried about Biden's political standing in the looming rematch with former Republican President Donald Trump “There's not enough energy,” Rikard said of Biden's coalition  “I think people are gonna need to wake up and get going ”Exactly six months before Election Day, Biden and Trump are locked in the first contest in 112 years with a current and former president competing for the White House  It's a race that is at once deeply entrenched and highly in flux as many voters are only just beginning to embrace the reality of the 2024 campaign ___What a judge's gag order on Trump means in his hush money caseNEW YORK (AP) — Virtually every day of his hush money criminal trial, former President Donald Trump talks about how he can’t talk about the case A gag order bars Trump from commenting publicly on witnesses, jurors and some others connected to the matter  The New York judge already has found that Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, repeatedly violated the order, fined him $9,000 and warning that jail could follow if he doesn't comply But the order doesn't stop Trump from talking about the allegations against him or commenting on the judge or the elected top prosecutor  And despite a recent Trump remark, it doesn't stop him from testifying in court if he chooses As he fights the felony charges against him while running for president, Trump has at times stirred confusion about what he can and can't do in the case  He has pleaded not guilty So what does the order do, what doesn't it and where did it come from?___3 bodies in Mexican well identified as Australian and American surfers killed for truck's tiresMEXICO CITY (AP) — Relatives have positively identified three bodies found in a well as those of two Australian surfers and one American who went missing last weekend, Mexican authorities said Sunday Baja California state prosecutors said the relatives had viewed the corpses recovered from a remote well about 50 feet (15 meters) deep and recognized them as their loved ones Thieves apparently killed the three, who were on a surfing trip to Mexico’s Baja peninsula, to steal their truck because they wanted the tires  They then allegedly got rid of the bodies by dumping them in a well near the coast The well was located some 4 miles (6 kilometers) from where the foreigners were killed, and also contained a fourth cadaver that had been there much longer Three suspects are being held in connection with the case, which locals said was solved far more quickly than the disappearances of thousands of Mexicans ___Last-minute candidate José Raúl Mulino wins Panama's presidential electionPANAMA CITY (AP) — José Raúl Mulino, the stand-in for former

of supporters, adding an expletive for emphasis  ”This is perhaps the most important date of my life, and the greatest responsibility of a Panamanian falls on my shoulders and my family to lead the

area where hundreds of people have been rescued from flooded homes and roads, while to the north in the Fort Worth area, a child died after being swept away when the car he was traveling in got stuck in floodwaters Over the last week, areas near Lake Livingston, located northeast of Houston, have gotten upwards of 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain, National Weather Service meteorologist Jimmy

inches (43 centimeters) of rain in that same period Scattered showers in the Houston area on Sunday brought light to moderate rainfall, he said “With the rainfall that fell overnight plus this morning

spotlights those missing or dead in Native communities, prosecutors work to solve their casesALBUQUERQUE, N M  (AP) — It was a frigid winter morning when authorities found a Native American man dead on a remote gravel road in western New Mexico  He was lying on his side, with only one sock on, his clothes gone and his shoes tossed in the snow There were trails of blood on both sides of his body and it appeared he had been struck in the head Investigators retraced the man's steps, gathering security camera footage that showed him walking near a convenience store miles away in Gallup, an economic hub in an otherwise rural area bordered on one side by the Navajo Nation and Zuni Pueblo on the other Court records said the footage and cell phone records showed the victim — a Navajo man identified only as John Doe — was “on a collision course” with the man who would ultimately be accused of killing him A grand jury has indicted a man from Zuni Pueblo on a charge of second-degree murder in the Jan  18 death, and prosecutors say more charges are likely as he is the prime suspect in a series of crimes targeting Native American men in Gallup, Zuni and Albuquerque  Investigators found several wallets, cell phones and clothing belonging to other men when searching his vehicle and two residences
