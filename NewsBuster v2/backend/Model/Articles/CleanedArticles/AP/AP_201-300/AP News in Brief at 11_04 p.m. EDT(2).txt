increasingly dividedDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli airstrike killed 27 people in central Gaza, mostly women and children, and fighting with Hamas raged across the north on Sunday as Israel's leaders aired divisions over who should govern Gaza after the war, now in its eighth month Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces criticism from the other members of his War Cabinet, with main political rival Benny Gantz threatening to leave the government if a plan is not created by June 8 that includes an international administration for postwar Gaza  His departure would leave Netanyahu more reliant on far-right allies who support full military occupation of Gaza and rebuilding of Jewish settlements there U S  National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with Netanyahu to discuss an ambitious U S  plan for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and help the Palestinian Authority govern Gaza in exchange for a path to eventual statehood  Netanyahu's office in a statement said they focused on Israel's military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, humanitarian aid and hostages held in Gaza Netanyahu opposes Palestinian statehood, saying Israel will maintain

upNEW YORK (AP) — Testimony in the hush money trial of Donald Trump is set to conclude in the coming days, putting the landmark case on track for jury deliberations that will determine whether it ends in a mistrial, an acquittal — or the first-ever felony conviction of a former American president Jurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics  Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt Here's a look at what the two sides have argued, who has been missing from the case, what to listen for in the final days and what prosecutors will have to prove to secure a conviction Through witnesses including a porn actor, a veteran tabloid publisher and longtime Trump aides, the prosecution aimed to link the presumptive Republican nominee for the White House this year to a hush money scheme during the 2016 presidential campaign that resulted in the filing of phony business records to mask the alleged conspiracy Jurors heard testimony that two women and a doorman were paid tens of thousands of dollars to keep quiet during that campaign about stories that, had they emerged, could have embarrassed Trump  Jurors heard claims of sex, saw copies of texts, emails and checks and listened to a secret recording in which Trump and his then-lawyer can be heard discussing a plan to buy the silence of a Playboy model ___Lai Ching-te inaugurated as Taiwan's president in a transition

partnerships with Taiwan’s unofficial allies such as the U S , Japan, South Korea and the Philippines He takes over from Tsai Ing-wen, who led Taiwan through eight years of economic and social

Dominican Republic (AP) — Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader headed to a second term following Sunday's general elections, declaring victory after his top competitors conceded early in the night as he held a strong leader in early vote tallies The outcome reinforced the government's crackdown along its shared border with Haiti and on the hundreds of thousands of people who have fled that violence-stricken nation, something only likely to continue in his next term Abinader, one of the most popular leaders in the Americas, and the early results showed him with nearly 60% of the votes   His competitors, former President Leonel Fernández and Mayor Abel Martínez, conceded early in the night Abinader supporters in his campaign headquarters started celebrating early on, blowing horns and cheering  In his victory speech, Abinader delivered a nationalistic message promising change and anti-corruption measures  He notably spoke little about of the government's harsh measures on Haitian migrants and the crisis in its island neighbor “The message from the results is clear, the changes that we've made are going to be irreversible,” he said  “In the Dominican Republic, the best is yet to come ”___Biden tells Morehouse graduates that scenes in Gaza from the Israel-Hamas war break his heart, tooATLANTA (AP) — President Joe Biden on Sunday offered his most direct recognition of U S  students' anguish over the Israel-Hamas war, telling graduates of historically Black Morehouse College that he heard their voices of protest and that scenes from the conflict in Gaza break his heart, too “I support peaceful nonviolent protest," he told students at the all-male college, some of whom wore Palestinian scarves known as keffiyehs around their shoulders on top of their black

reflected on American democracy and his role in safeguarding it “It’s one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world,” Biden said  “There’s nothing easy about it  I know it angers and frustrates many of you, including my family  But most of all I know it breaks your heart  It breaks mine as well ”To date, Biden had limited his public comments around the protests on U S  college campuses to upholding the right to peaceful protest ___Ed Dwight, America's first Black astronaut candidate, finally goes to space 60 years laterVAN HORN, Texas (AP) — Ed Dwight, America’s first Black

champion brought small reminders that it was never going to be easy It wasn't just Bryson DeChambeau pushing in the PGA Championship until he finally caught Schauffele with a birdie on the last hole at Valhalla It was the mud on Schauffele's golf ball after a good drive on the 16th  It was the tee shot on the 17th that kicked back into a bunker instead of forward into the fairway  Needing birdie on the par-5 18th for the win, he hit what he thought was a good drive until Schauffele walked up and saw it had rolled close enough to a bunker that he couldn't get a clean shot at the green “I just kept telling myself, ‘Man, someone out there is making me earn this right now,’” Schauffele said  “I get up there and just kind of chuckled  I was like, ‘If you want to be a major champion, this is the kind of stuff you have to deal with ’”There was one other message he preached along the back nine
