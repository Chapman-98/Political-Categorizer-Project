in fact, I was with them as the pooler for a trip to the Middle East just months before  You must show that you can do the work, that you won’t get in the way  It helps to show them that if they work with you and trust your instincts, that images of their guy will go around the world I need to travel lightly on State Department trips  I wear all the gear on my body, even on the planes  There’s no time to pack and unpack a camera bag  Traveling compactly comes in handy when you must push through a wall of Qatari official photographers or slip into photo opportunities quickly last minute because you had to sprint up from the back of a very long motorcade I’m not a photographer who covers war and conflict  I cover mainly politics  There was one overnight moment when we were being held outside in the middle of Israel's Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv where alarms went off  Rockets were incoming and the press pool had to seek shelter underground  I felt the booms from the Iron Dome detonation  I hadn’t experienced that previously, and it shook me  As a mother, I will admit to sending messages to my son to say I loved him, just in case  It seems sort of silly looking back, as we were in a safe place and so many people in the region were suffering much worse at that same moment  But it was scary and really brought home the seriousness of what had happened and how the situation could spiral
