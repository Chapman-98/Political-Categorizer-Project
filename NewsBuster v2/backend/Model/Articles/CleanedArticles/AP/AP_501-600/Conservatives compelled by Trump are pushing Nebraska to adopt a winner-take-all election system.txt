the 48 other states award all of their electoral votes to whichever candidate wins statewide “It was probably well-intended, but this whole thing is just the goofiest thing I’ve ever seen,” Kirk said of Nebraska's split system Republican Trump could need every electoral vote he can get to defeat President Joe Biden in a rematch of the 2020 race Kirk said rally stemmed from a map that he and the team that produces his podcast saw last week showing that if Biden were to win the Rust Belt swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, an electoral vote from Nebraska would give him the 270 electoral votes for reelection, even if Trump carries all the other swing states “One of our team members came out and said, 'Yeah, unless Nebraska just goes and fixes it,” Kirk recounted The issue gained national attention when Kirk urged his followers to call Republican Nebraska Gov  Jim Pillen’s office to urge the state to adopt a winner-take-all approach this year  Five hours later, Pillen issued a statement urging the Legislature to pass a bill, currently stalled in committee, that would change Nebraska to a winner-take-all state  Shortly after that, Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, to praise Pillen and urge the switch Republicans, who have long dominated Nebraska politics, have sought unsuccessfully to return the state to winner-take-all since it was adopted more than 30 years ago in 1991  The sticking point this year has been a focus on property tax reduction, school funding and a number of wedge issues  By the time Pillen issued his call last week to pass a winner-take-all bill, only a handful of days remained in the session — not enough time to pull the bill from committee and get it through three rounds of debate ahead of other priority bills Now, Kirk and Nebraska Republicans want the governor to call a special session after the current session's last day on April 18 to pass a winner-take-all measure “I had a very promising phone call with somebody in the governor’s office today, and they are committed to getting into a special session to get this to happen,” Kirk said While it's certainly within Pillen's purview to do so, it's not clear there are enough votes for a winner-take-all bill to pass in the unique one-chamber Nebraska Legislature made up of 49 lawmakers The body is officially nonpartisan, but lawmakers self-identify as Republican, Democrat or independent and tend to vote along party lines  Republicans currently hold 33 of the legislative body’s 49 seats, which is just enough to break a filibuster — as long as all 33 Republicans vote to end debate But Omaha Sen  Mike McDonnell, who switched parties last week from Democrat to Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner that he won't vote for a winner-take-all system Pillen did not attend the rally, nor did any state lawmaker, as the Legislature worked late Tuesday in the last days of this year's session Still, Kirk and others, like Nebraska GOP chairman Eric Underwood, urged the crowd attending the rally to call lawmakers daily until they agree to take up and pass the measure ahead of the November election “If Nov  6 comes and we didn't do everything we can, we're going to lose this country,” Underwood told the crowd  “We're going to pass winner-take-all  We're going to find a way to get it done ”
