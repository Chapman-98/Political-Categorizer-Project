SAN FRANCISCO — Billionaire Elon Musk abruptly canceled “The Don Lemon Show" on his social media network X after the former CNN anchor recorded an interview with the billionaire for its as-yet unaired first episode.Musk owns X, formerly known as Twitter, and frequently proclaims himself a “free speech absolutist.” In a post on X, the San Francisco-based company said only that after careful consideration, it "decided not to enter into a commercial partnership with the show.” It added that Lemon's show “is welcome to publish its content on X, without censorship, as we believe in providing a platform for creators to scale their work and connect with new communities.”In a video posted to X on Wednesday, Lemon declared that “ Elon Musk is mad at me \u2033 and said he will be airing his interview with the Tesla CEO on YouTube and via podcast on Monday.Lemon didn’t go into specifics about the source of Musk’s alleged unhappiness, but wrote, “Throughout our conversation, I kept reiterating to him that although it was tense at times, I thought it was good for people to see and hear our exchange and that they would learn from our conversation.”“But apparently free speech absolutism doesn’t apply when it comes to questions about him from people like me,” Lemon added.X announced in January a “new content partnership” with Lemon for the show, saying it would post 30 minute episodes three times a week on subjects including politics, culture, sports and entertainment. That deal was part of the struggling platform's efforts to bolster its content offerings and attract advertisers. X also announced shows hosted by former member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard and sports radio host Jim Rome.Lemon was fired by CNN last year after a 17-year run with the network. His ouster came a little over two months after he apologized for on-air comments about then-Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley not being in “her prime” that he made during his short run as a morning show host.
