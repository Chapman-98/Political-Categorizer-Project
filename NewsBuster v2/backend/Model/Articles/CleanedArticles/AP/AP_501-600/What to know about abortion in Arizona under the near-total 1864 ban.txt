LEGAL, LEGISLATIVE AND POLITICAL BATTLESThe court gave the parties two weeks to decide whether to file legal claims Gov  Katie Hobbs called on the state Legislature to act immediately to undo the law before it took effect “They could gavel in today and make a motion to repeal this ban,” Hobbs said Wednesday on “CBS Mornings ” "And they should do that  I’m hopeful that they will because this will have devastating consequences for Arizona ”But GOP lawmakers shut down an effort to force a vote on such a measure Wednesday A near-total ban could drastically reduce abortions in Arizona, from about 1,100 monthly as estimated by a survey for the Society of Family Planning And voters could get a say in November  Abortion rights advocates said they already have more than enough signatures to add a ballot question asking voters to approve a constitutional amendment protecting the right to abortion until viability, when a fetus could survive outside the womb  Later abortions would be allowed to save the woman's life or protect her physical or mental health ___Lee reported from Santa Fe, New Mexico  Associated Press reporters Laura Ungar in Louisville, Kentucky, and Geoff Mulvihill in Chicago contributed to this article
