PressDateline: ANNAPOLIS, Md  BodyANNAPOLIS, Md  — Republican voters advanced strong Senate contenders in Maryland and West Virginia on Tuesday, giving the GOP a big boost in its push to claim control of Congress' upper chamber Former Gov  Larry Hogan claimed the Republican nomination in what will be a marquee race in Maryland against Angela Alsobrooks, a top local official who could become the fourth Black woman in U S  history to serve in the Senate Meanwhile, another popular Republican, Gov  Jim Justice, won the Senate nomination in deep-red West Virginia, becoming the overwhelming favorite in the race that represents the GOP's best pickup opportunity in the nation In both states, which share a border but feature antithetical politics, the Republican nominees represent a serious challenge for Democrats in the general election as they cling to a 51-49 Senate majority and defend seats in other states that former President Donald Trump won four years ago At the same time, Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden sought to project strength in low-stakes presidential primaries  And further down the ballot, two people who were on opposite sides of the Jan  6 insurrection lost their U S  House bids — a former Capitol Police officer running in Maryland and a former West Virginia state lawmaker who participated in the riot In all, three states hosted statewide primary elections Tuesday — Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia — as Republicans and Democrats picked their nominees for a slate of November elections that will decide the presidency and control of Congress A TRUMP CRITIC GRABS MARYLAND’S GOP NOMINATIONIn Maryland, Hogan gives Republicans a legitimate chance at picking up a Senate seat in the deep-blue state for the first time in more than four decades Hogan overcame his years-long criticism of Trump, a position that put him at odds with many Republican primary voters but will undoubtedly help him in the general election this fall  Maryland voters gave Biden a 33-point victory over Trump four years ago On the other side in the Senate contest, Democratic voters nominated Alsobrooks, the top official in Prince George's County outside of Washington  The 53-year-old African American county executive had been endorsed by many of the state’s top officials, including Gov  Wes Moore, Sen  Chris Van Hollen and U S  Rep  Steny Hoyer Alsobrooks prevailed after a contentious and expensive primary against U S  Rep  David Trone, a liquor store magnate who had invested more than $61 million into his unsuccessful bid Race was an issue in the Democratic primary and may be in the general election in the months ahead  Alsobrooks is trying to become the first Black senator from a state in which roughly one in three residents identifies as African American On the social media site X, Hogan congratulated Alsobrooks and said, “Voters have a clear and stark choice: more of the dysfunctional partisan status quo or real independent and bipartisan leadership ”Alsobrooks, also posting on X, promised to “defeat Larry Hogan, keep Maryland blue, and keep our Senate under Democratic control ”THE WEST VIRGINIA BATTLE TO REPLACE MANCHINJustice won his primary against U S  Rep  Alex Mooney  With Democratic Sen  Joe Manchin gone, the seat is almost guaranteed to turn red come November The Trump-endorsed Justice, a former billionaire with a folksy personality, is wildly popular in the state  A former Democrat, Justice switched to the Republican Party in 2017, announcing the change at a Trump rally Despite his connection to the former Republican president, Justice doesn't pander to Trump as much as most statewide Republican officials in the state  And he largely avoids focusing on some of the GOP’s favorite culture war issues, such as transgender rights Mooney had tried to win over conservatives by labeling Justice a “RINO” — which stands for “Republican in name only” — who would support Democratic policies  Justice did support Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law, saying West Virginia couldn’t afford to turn away the money offered in the bill At a polling place in West Virginia’s capital city, voter Steve Ervin said his votes Tuesday were directly related to Trump “I really did an exhaustive study of the sample ballot of who I believe supported Trump and Trump supported them,” said Ervin, who works in the state’s unemployment office  “That’s what I made my whole decision on ”Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the Republican nominee in the 2018 Senate race against Manchin, won the nomination for West Virginia governor TESTS OF STRENGTH IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARYBiden and Trump have already amassed enough delegates to claim the presidential nominations at their respective national conventions this summer  And they added to their total Tuesday with wins in Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia Yet voters on both sides hoped to register a significant protest vote Tuesday that would demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the Biden-Trump rematch Maryland progressives especially unhappy with the Biden administration’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas had encouraged voters to select “uncommitted to any presidential candidate” instead  Results coming in Tuesday night suggested the “uncommitted” vote was running behind the margins of similar movements in Michigan and Minnesota There was no uncommitted option in West Virginia or Nebraska Everett Bellamy, a Democrat who voted early in Annapolis, said he voted “uncommitted” instead of Biden as a protest against the killing of women and children and noncombatants in Gaza “I wanted to send a message,” Bellamy, 74, said after leaving an early voting center Meanwhile, Trump's Republican critics could not choose “uncommitted,” but they could choose his former GOP rival Nikki Haley, who appeared on the ballot in Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia despite formally suspending her campaign more than two months ago Derek Faux, an independent voter from Charleston, West Virginia, said he supported Haley, and in other Republican races, he said he voted for the candidates he believed were least like Trump “I would rather see moderate, reasonable Republicans than some of the other folks,” said Faux, a librarian TWO SIDES OF THE INSURRECTIONTuesday's elections also included two candidates who were intimately involved in the Jan  6, 2021, attack on the U S  Capitol In Maryland, former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn was among nearly two dozen Democrats running in the state’s 3rd Congressional District  The 40-year-old Democrat lost to State Sen  Sarah Elfreth In West Virginia, a former member of the House of Delegates, Derrick Evans, lost his bid to oust incumbent Republican Rep  Carol Miller in the 1st Congressional District  The 39-year-old Evans served a three-month jail sentence after livestreaming himself participating in the storming of the U S  Capitol OTHER KEY RACESIn Nebraska, Republican Sens  Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts both won their primaries, one of the rare occasions when both senators in a state were on the ballot at the same time  And in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, Republican U S  Rep  Don Bacon fended off a challenge from his right flank In North Carolina, voters finalized their pick of the Trump-endorsed Brad Knott in what had become a one-person Republican primary in the state's 13th Congressional District ___This story has deleted an incorrect reference to a California election being Tuesday  The California election is next week
