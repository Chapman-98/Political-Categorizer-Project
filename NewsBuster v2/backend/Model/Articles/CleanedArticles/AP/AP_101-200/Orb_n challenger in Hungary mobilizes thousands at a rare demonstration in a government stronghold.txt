What’s the truth?”Katalin Nagy, who traveled several hours to the rally, said she finds Magyar credible “because he comes from the inside ”“He’s aware of the things that are really causing problems in this country, and I think he can provide solutions to problems so that we can come out of the hole that this country is currently in,” she said Recent polls show that Magyar’s party may have become the largest opposition force little more than a month before the election  Pollster Median this week measured TISZA at 25% among certain voters, with Orbán’s Fidesz well ahead at 45% Governing party politicians have dismissed Magyar, who describes himself as a moderate conservative, as a leftist in disguise, and suggested that foreign interests lie behind his rise Orbán and has party have ruled Hungary with a constitutional majority since 2010
