only six have been unseated since Arizona adopted its judicial retention election system in 1974 Democrats, meanwhile, have put the abortion ruling at the center of their quest to take control of the state Legislature for the first time in decades  Sen  Bolick, representing one of the most competitive districts in the state, is among their top targets Bolick appeared to argue on the floor that a repeal would guard against extreme ballot initiatives to enshrine abortion rights, saying she wanted “to protect our state constitution from unlimited abortions ”But the Center for Arizona Policy, an anti-abortion advocacy group, blasted her for voting “with pro-abortion activist lawmakers "Some Republican colleagues agreed “She has confused the pro-life community,” Sen  Jake Hoffman said on the floor after Shawnna Bolick's vote  “Make no mistake, to everybody watching this and hearing my voice right now, and everyone who will hear it, she voted for abortions ”The repeal bill won’t take effect until 90 days after the state’s legislative session ends, typically in June or July  The Civil War-era ban could meanwhile be enforced, but the high court issued a stay on its decision, making a 2022 statute banning abortions after 15 weeks Arizona’s prevailing abortion law But the legal landscape could change yet again if Arizona voters approve a ballot measure in November to enshrine abortion access up to 24 weeks of pregnancy in the state constitution  Organizers say they’ll submit more than enough signatures by the July 3 deadline ___Yamat reported from Las Vegas  Associated Press writers Jonathan J  Cooper and Anita Snow in Phoenix contributed to this report
