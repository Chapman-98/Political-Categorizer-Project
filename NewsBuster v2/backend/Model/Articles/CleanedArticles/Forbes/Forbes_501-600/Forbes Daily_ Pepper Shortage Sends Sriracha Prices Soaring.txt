Here<figure><figcaption> The scale-up piece still remains as a big, huge, very costly part of bringing this to market,  investor Lisa Feria told Forbes ILLUSTRATION BY ANGELICA ALZONA FOR FORBES;

great entrepreneurial success story of the next generation Investors do have a right to feel giddy, as last week U S -based startups Good Meat and Upside Foods got the nod to go to market from the U S  Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration  But a variety of factors willhinder the adoption and growthof no-kill meat Not least of which is the cost: in the past five years, billions of dollarshave been spent on developingthe 100-plus startups in the industry  They will need billions more To produce lab-grown meat, manufacturers use what s called a bioreactor the same machinery drug companies use to make vaccines They re expensiveand have long waitlists  Also costly is construction of the factories in which to put the bioreactors  Good Meat CEO Josh Tetrick says a facility able to produce 30 million pounds of cultivated meat would cost as much as $650 million As a result, prices will be high but not high enough to turn a profit  Brands have decided totake substantial lossesso that the prices of cultivated-meat dishes are in line with what ordinary customers are used to  Lab-grown meat may never make money, and the cost structure is expected to be out of whack for years, if not decades, and many of the folks trying lab-grown meat now for the first time may never see a time when the products are profitable WHY IT MATTERS  Profitability is very much years off because the biggest challenge ahead of them is can we make it at millions of tons a year and ultimately remotely compete with conventional meat,  says investor Lisa Feria, who backs Upside Foods as well as a host of its competitors, and predicts that a lot of startups will eventually merge or be acquired by large meat companies like Tyson and JBS MOREInside Costco s Billion-Dollar Bet
