Or anyone s. Second is that I knew him and we met occasionally. Key BackgroundBoth Chomsky and Botstein met with Epstein dozens of times, they confirmed to theJournalfor an April report, placing them among scores of prominent figures who met with the financier after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution. Epstein was charged with sex trafficking and died by suicide in jail while awaiting a trial in 2019. In 2015 and 2016, Epstein arranged several meetings with Chomsky and other academics like Harvard University professor Martin Nowak, according to documents obtained by theJournaland confirmation from Chomsky. The meetings were to discuss academic topics like geopolitics and neuroscience, often including world leaders like former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak (Chomsky is a noted critic of Israel). Chomsky said he participated in the meetings despite knowing Epstein was a convicted sex offender because he knew he had served his sentence and  according U.S. laws and norms, that yields a clean slate.  Through his work on linguistics, philosophy and politics, Chomsky sideashave been influential in anti-capitalist, ant-war and anti-imperialist movements. Botstein had two dozen scheduled meetings with Epstein, over about four years.    Had the extent and horror of Epstein s crimes been known, Bard would not have accepted his support," a spokesperson for the college toldForbesin an emailed statement.Further ReadingJeffrey Epstein Moved $270,000 for Noam Chomsky and Paid $150,000 to Leon Botstein(Wall Street Journal)Epstein s Private Calendar Reveals Prominent Names, Including CIA Chief, Goldman s Top Lawyer(Wall Street Journal)Jeffrey Epstein Lawsuit: Musk Subpoenaed As Case Embroils Another Billionaire(Forbes)
