<figure><figcaption>The recent return to a higher profile in China by billionaire business icon Jack Ma, main founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, has stirred hopes for government support for the country's private sector  (Jorge Silva/Pool Photo via AP)Associated Press</figcaption></figure>Brisk economic growth for much of the past two decades helped to turn China into the world s No  2 economy and give it second-largest membership on the annual Forbes Billionaires List  Growth has slowed in the past year in part on geopolitical tensions with the U S  and a leftward tilt in Chinese politics  This year,the number of billionaires fell, to 495 from 539 in 2022,amid weak private sector investment and consumer sentiment  The number of Chinese companies to make the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world s top publicly traded companies also declined (see linkhere)  Confidence is really important ,  said John Quelch, a Harvard Business School professor and former dean of the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai who traveled in the country in June   Chinese businesspeople are not feeling that confident right now about investing in China  And you see the lack of confidence manifested in lukewarm growth in Chinese consumption  Many Chinese are reverting to saving a higher percentage of their available income after necessities rather than investing it  These trends are a source of concern,  Quelch told Forbes in a recent interview in Boston  Private sector companies are particularly important as by some estimates, they account for as much as 60% of China s GDP Worries about the economic outlook are reflected in the country s stock market performance  The benchmark CSI 300 Index, for instance, has declined by 12 8% in the past year   The Chinese stock market is largely a retail market and it s weak  That s often a reflection of a lack of consumer confidence in the long-term economic prospects,  Quelch said Yet tepid private-sector investment in the country isn t likely to last forever, Quelch believes, based in part on his observations from his recent visit   There's an effort now to restore the confidence of the private sector with a view to re-igniting investment,  he said   The government realizes that they may have over overdone it with respect to clamping down  on the private sector, given that this put a damper on private sector investment  which is essential to move the economy forward  <figure><figcaption>Harvard Professor John Quelch, third from left, visited Fidelity Investments' office in Shanghai last month John

lightening the regulatory touch  The signaling system in China is very well developed, in terms of the central government sending signals to the private sector,  he said Authorities are also  very astute for the most part  in knowing whom to signal, Quelch continued  Entrepreneurs started to lose their  chutzpah  after a technology industry crackdown that  went too far,  but that is reversing, he believes  Recent public appearances by Internet heavyweight Alibaba s billionaire main founder Jack Ma, a Chinese business icon who fell out with the government in 2020 after criticizing the state-dominated banking industry, point to improvement, Quelch said The 71-year-old British-American author of 25 books spoke ahead ofa visit to Beijing by U S  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen this weekthat aims to improve badly strained U S -China relations  Just last week, the U S  Embassy advised businesspeople to reconsider travel to the country following the passage of an amended national security law   Reconsider travel to Mainland China due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans, and the risk of wrongful detentions,  it said China s new security policies are  open-ended and therefore a significant source of uncertainty and concern  among multinational companies, following government raids on American companies conducting research and due diligence including Bain and Mintz   It means that security management and legal counsel figure more prominently in the day-to-day lives of China-based CEOs of multinational companies  Several have established much stricter protocols with respect to internal communication flows of privileged information  Tit-for-tat moves by the two sides to limit trade in semiconductor equipment and materials underscore the risks of a rising bilateral protectionism whose onset can most recently be traced to tariff increases on Chinese goods by the Trump administration, Quelch said Rather than a dramatic overall improvement in the U S  trade deficit with China, the Trump-era import taxes have led Chinese businesses to upgrade and diversify their manufacturing, he said   In order to sustain demand from the U S , Chinese producers have doubled down on production efficiency in order to absorb some of the price increases (associated with tariffs) through cost reduction,  Quelch said   That further enhanced Chinese manufacturing efficiency  Other Chinese companies  have played into the decoupling agenda by setting up their own manufacturing plants in Vietnam and other friendly countries,  he said  Similarly, Chinese businesses including EV maker NIO have made a big push to expand their investment and funding ties with the Middle East  (See related posthere )  Chinese companies are diversifying their export markets and internationalizing their production,  Quelch noted To be sure, U S  restrictions on Chinese companies reflect limits to the openness of China s own market, he said   The reality is that China still does not offer a level playing field to American companies operating in China,  Quelch said  Washington s regulatory responses have been largely  unconstructive but understandable   A falloff in Chinese investment in the U S  in recent years  is also disheartening,  he added   I'm sure the more there are mutual trade and investment flows, the better the guarantee of world peace,  he saidVisits to China of late by American business leaders Microsoft s Bill Gates and JPMorgan s Jamie Dimon signal efforts to change the dynamic and counter anti-China political rhetoric ahead of the 2024 U S  presidential election   Collectively, business leadership in the U S  has reached the conclusion that they need to break the ice in order for the political ice to be broken, and that has been very helpful,  Quelch said <figure><figcaption>Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, in Beijing on June

said a  de-dollarization  of world trade, backed rhetorically by China and its partners such as Brazil, isn t about to happen at scale anytime soon  As a veteran marketer, I believe that any alternative (to the U S  dollar) has to be better, cheaper, or faster,  Quelch said   While there may be government to government trades that are conducted in yuan for political purposes, the notion that the yuan is going to be a regular trading currency at the commercial level is a long way off   The banking crisis and the rapid increase in interest rates have really hurt emerging markets  due to large holdings in U S  dollar debt in those countries,  he said   Both of those factors have given grist to the mill that alternative settlement currencies are now worth considering   However, the strength of the dollar is substantial,  owing to its ownership in currency reserves globally and large U S  stake of global GDP   25%, Quelch said  Last but not least, he said, China s currency  is constrained mightily by the fact that the yuan is not freely converted in the capital markets  Quelch also expressed concern about the small number of American students currently studying in China  Mainland students attending U S  universities outnumber Americans studying in China by a ratio of almost one hundred to one, he said A decline in the number of expatriates in China since the start of the pandemic and difficulties in getting Chinese visas is reducing the number of foreign experts focused on the country, and making it difficult for internationally oriented schools there to maintain their student enrollments   If the expats are leaving, that weakens the ties between the two countries, and that s not good,  Quelch said See related posts:U S  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen To
