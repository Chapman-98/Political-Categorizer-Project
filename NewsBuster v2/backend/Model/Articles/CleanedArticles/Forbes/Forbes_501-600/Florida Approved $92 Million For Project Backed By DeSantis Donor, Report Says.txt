an outdoor shopping mall on land abutting the planned interchange The interstate project includes several partial access roads onto Hosseini s property, plans that were not included in the initial design for the  Woodhaven  development, according to thePost, which noted other developments will also benefit from the new exits The Florida Department of Transportation announced plans to use federal funds for the $126 million project about three weeks after DeSantis s re-election in November, one of several transportation projects selected to receive the funding, in part, because it was ready for construction, Florida transportation secretary for the state s central district, John Tyler, told local planners in Volusia County at a meeting in January, thePost reported The interchange project has been in the works for decades, long predating Hosseini s development, and the access roads to his property were included in the plans to ensure adequate drainage patterns for the surrounding waterways, state Transportation Department spokesperson Jessica Ottaviano told thePost, noting the interchange  will help keep up with Florida s growing population  Crucial QuoteHosseini, who has reportedly called Woodhaven his  best project yet,  acknowledged the highway project would benefit his plans in a 2019 interview, telling the with or without the interchange, we would have built Woodhaven there, but it certainly helps  Key BackgroundThe revelation that Hosseini would benefit from the project adds to ethical questions raised by a previousWashington Postreportthat found Hosseini donated a golf simulator valued at more than $25,000 to the governor s mansion shortly after DeSantis, an avid golfer, moved in  The paper also reported Hosseini allowed the DeSantises to use his private planes and donated more than $361,000 to the governor s 2022 re-election campaign and political organizations backing him  Employees of the governor s office are prohibited from accepting gifts intended to influence political decisions, including those from "parties who have pending matters awaiting decision by the state,  but the simulator was technically a loan and private plane travel for political purposes, along with campaign donations, are not considered gifts, according to thePost  Redfern acknowledged Hosseini donated the golf simulator in a statement toCNNearlier this month, noting it was approved by legal counsel and in line with precedent set by  many  previous administrations that have accepted  donations to the residence and grounds   The state Ethics Commission has ruled previously that a public official can accept a donation as long as it is under control of a government agency, thePost reported  The Governor s Mansion is property of the State of Florida and overseen by the Department of Management Services ContraDeSantis spokesperson Jeremy Redfern posted screenshots to Twitter late Wednesday of emails from thePost seeking comment about the story, which a reporter laid out in detail to the governor s office  Redfern attacked the story in a series of mocking Tweets, includingonethat features a photo of thePost reporter edited to show him wearing a clown costume  The  premise is false, and there s nothing to answer,  Redfern tweeted, referring to the reporting, which he claimed is a  nothing-burger  and product of the  corporate media  Chief CriticSome local groups and environmentalists oppose the project and its potential impact on the nearby Spruce Creek waterway   Powerful developers want the interchange so they can more easily build on nearby land they own,  former Republican Gov  Charlie Crist, who challenged DeSantis as a Democrat in last year s election, wrote in a 2022op-edin theDaytona Beach News-Journal TangentHosseini, who is chairman and CEO of ICI homes, has numerous ties to DeSantis  The governor reappointed him in 2021 to the University of Florida board and he co-chaired DeSantis s gubernatorial transition team, along with his inaugural committee s finance team  On at least a dozen locations, he has lent his private plane to DeSantis and his wife, Casey, and arranged for DeSantis to play golf at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia  The relationship raised eyebrows among ethics watchdogs and political observers who were quick to point out that the benefits are at odds with the  blue-collar, salt-of-the-earth  roots DeSantis has touted on the campaign trail  He also routinely rebukes elites and promised to  drain the swamp,  invoking former President Donald Trump s term
