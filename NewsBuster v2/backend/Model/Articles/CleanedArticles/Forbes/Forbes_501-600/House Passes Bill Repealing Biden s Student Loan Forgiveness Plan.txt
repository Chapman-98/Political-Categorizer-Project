ToplineThe House of Representatives voted 218-203 to repeal President Joe Biden s student debt forgiveness plan and restart loan payments after a years-long pause, adding new pressure as the forgiveness plan awaits a Supreme Court ruling though the bill faces long odds in the Senate, and Biden has said he will veto the bill if it makes it to his desk.<figure><figcaption>The House of Representatives voted 218-203 to repeal President Joe Biden s student debt forgiveness plan and restart loan payments after a years-long pause.

Bob Good (R-Va.), while 203 Democrats voted against it.The bill would block Biden s loan cancellation plan, which would forgive $10,000 in federally issued student loans for Americans with incomes less than $125,000, and $20,000 for those who received Pell grants.In a statement posted to Twitter, Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), the bill s lead sponsor, called Biden s plan a  reckless, unilateral and unauthorized  scheme that would shift  hundreds of billions of dollars of payments from student loan borrowers onto the backs of the American people  and punish people who worked to pay back their loans.The bill will now go to the Democrat-controlled Senate, where it will likely not pass unless enough Democrats cross party lines.The House previously voted to stop Biden s debt forgiveness plan as part of a bill to raise the debt ceiling, but this is the first time it voted exclusively on a bill about the debt forgiveness.Tangent The student loan forgiveness plan is already held up in the Supreme Court, where a decision is expected on whether the Biden Administration can start forgiving loans in June.Chief Critic Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), assistant Democratic leader in the House,saidthat by passing this bill, Republicans are  seeking to put politics over people  and inflict undue harm by retroactively charging student loan borrowers interest on their paused payments and  claw(ing) back aid from public servants.  If enacted, Clyburn said the bill would  rescind life-changing relief for hard-working borrowers. Big Number $315 billion. That s how much the Congressional Budget Officeestimatedrepealing Biden s student loan forgiveness program would decrease the federal deficit by over the course of a decade.Key BackgroundRepublicans have criticized Biden s student loan forgiveness plan since he announced it last year, saying it is unfair to people who didn t attend college or take out loans and people who have already paid their loans off. Democrats, on the other hand, have argued loans have placed too much of a burden on lower- and middle-income people and passing some kind of debt relief would help reduce that burden. When introducing the plan, the Biden Administrationsaidit would provide relief for about 43 million borrowers, including canceling the remaining debt completely for about 20 million borrowers. The Senate had not scheduled a vote on the resolution yet.Further Reading House passes measure to block Biden's student debt relief program(NBC News)House passes bill to block Biden's student loan forgiveness program(CNN)
