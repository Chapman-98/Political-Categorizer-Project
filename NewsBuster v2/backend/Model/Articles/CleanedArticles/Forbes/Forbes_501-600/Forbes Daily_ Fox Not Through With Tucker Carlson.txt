Startup Whose Technology Promises An American Energy Transformation  <figure><figcaption>Jonathan Rowntree of NironNATE RYAN FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE They re little-known to most consumers, butpermanent magnets made with rare-earth metals power our modern lives  They go into motors and generators that enable electricity to be transformed into motion and motion into electricity for everything from electric vehicles to wind turbines Because of their higher performance allowing smaller, more powerful motors than alternatives theiruse continues to rise, with global demand for rare-earth magnets expected to increase at 7 5% compounded annually through 2040, per Adamas Intelligence All of that has created an enormous need to create the magnets with analternative to the rare-earth metals that come from China  That s where Niron, an under-the-radar startup that has raised over $100 million, comes in In Niron s pilot plant in Minneapolis, workers take iron in powdered form and bubble nitrogen through it to create iron nitride, an extremely magnetic material  Historically,rare-earth alternatives haven t been as powerfulas the permanent magnets they hope to replace, but Niron says its iron-nitride process can already replace some rare-earth magnets and it s continuing to improve the technology Some two dozen partners in areas likeautomotive, consumer electronics and power toolsare conducting pre-production sampling of Niron magnets  The company s technology is based on research developed by University of Minnesota professor Jian-Ping Wang  He s spent most of his life studying magnets, and is Niron s chief scientific officer and on its board of directors Today, the pilot plant produces just 100 kilos of magnets and the company brings in minimal revenue  But it s begun scoping out locations for a full-scale production facility, which would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, that it expects to open within the next three or four years WHY IT MATTERS Demand for permanent magnets far outstrips supply, and most rare earth magnets come from China  Niron s new technology could fill that gap, while offering an answer to geopolitical tensions and supply-chain instability   We have a solution to the rare-earth crisis,  says CEO Jonathan Rowntree MOREMeet The Texas Startup That Recycles Rare-Earth Magnets, Bypassing ChinaFACTS AND COMMENTSA
