Limitless Clean Energy<figure><figcaption>Koloma's Tom Darrah developed ways to find and extract underground hydrogen THEO STROOMER FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE A new form of underground energy could dramatically speed the shift away from planet-ruining fossil fuels: so-called  geologic  hydrogen It s been found in vast deposits along tectonic plates, where conditions are ripe for the lightest element on earth to remain in its pure, gas form  It s on every continent,  says Tom Darrah, a professor of earth sciences at Ohio State University  The scale of how much there is is profound  As is its potential to temper a looming climate catastrophe already heralded by ever-fiercer heat waves, heavier rainstorms and more violent hurricanes  That s because the universe s most abundant element is carbon-free and has the highest energy content of any fuel by weight  But no one has tapped into the underground variety and scaled it into a business Koloma, a Denver startup quietly founded two years ago, thinks it s figured out how to do exactly that  And cofounder Darrah is planning for a future wherewe drill for hydrogenjust as we ve historically drilled for oil and gas It sbacked with $91 millionfrom Bill Gates s Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Energy Impact Partners, Ev k Innovations, Prelude Ventures and Piva Capital, making it the most well-funded startup in the space by far Right now, the world uses about 100 million metric tons of hydrogen annually,a market worth more than $120 billion, according to Goldman Sachs  Nearly all of it s made from natural gas, a process that emits carbon, and most is used for oil refining, making fertilizer, chemicals and food processing Koloma and its backers see big money: Goldman estimates the hydrogen market will double to $250 billion by 2030 and top $1 trillion annually by 2050 WHY IT MATTERS Michael Webber, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, admits geologic hydrogen  blew [his] mind  when he began studying it five years ago  He said there s a kind of obviousness to it  The earth always has the answer if you're just willing to be open-minded and look,  he said   The earth gives us wind and solar and waves and hydro; it gives us oil and gas and coal and peat and cow dung  Why wouldn't it give us hydrogen? It kind of makes sense in some grand philosophical arc  MORE: Forget Oil  New Wildcatters Are Drilling For Limitless  Geologic  HydrogenFACTS AND COMMENTSWhether you exercise a little every day or for a long time once or twice a week, as long as you re getting the recommended amount, thebenefits are the same  That s according to a new report that studied 89,500 people in three groups active weekend warrior, active regular and inactive:150:Number of minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity the CDC recommends each week28%:Share of Americans who exercise at that level$117 billion:Annual healthcare costs associated with adults not getting enough physical activity, per the CDCSTRATEGY AND SUCCESSCompanies with remote or hybrid policies appear to behiring people at about twice the rateof employers that are fully in office, according to new analysis   When we looked at headcount increase over the last 12 months, fully flexible and  structured hybrid  [employers] wereoutperforming fully in office companiesat least in terms of a percentage of headcount," says Robert Sadow, cofounder and CEO of Scoop, a hybrid work management software company behind the report VIDEOhttps://www forbes com/video/6331405469112/QUIZWyoming-based taco chain Taco John s announced Tuesday it will give up itstrademark registration on the phrase  Taco Tuesday  Which restaurant chain filed legal petitions to cancel the trademark and mounted an advertising campaign to  liberate Taco Tuesday?
