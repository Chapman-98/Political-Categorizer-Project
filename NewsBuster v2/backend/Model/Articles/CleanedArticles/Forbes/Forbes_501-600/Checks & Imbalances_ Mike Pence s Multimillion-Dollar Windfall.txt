Today we look at Mike Pence s lucrative post-Veep years. Checks & Imbalances is off next week. We'll return the following week, now on Thursday, with a fresh look. Happy Fourth!Mike Pence s Multimillion-Dollar Windfall  Presidential candidate MikePence received more than $4.8 millionfrom speaking, writing and consulting since the start of 2022, according to a financial disclosure report he filed with the federal government Wednesday. Pence s memoir  So Help Me God,  provided $1.4 million in advance payments. He got another $3.4 million from delivering 32 speeches,  reports Matt Durot.Pence conducts his speaking, writing and consulting through a company called Hoosier Heartland LLC. The disclosure listed business income for that entity of $1.8 million. Pence also noted a $381,000 salary from Hoosier Heartland.The disclosure also shows two family trusts, one of which is worth more than $1 million and has kicked off somewhere between $100,000 and $1 million of income since the start of 2022. The second trust is much smaller, worth just $50,000 to $100,000.It s big money for Pence, a 64-year-old former radio host, who wasn t all that rich when he served as vice president. Forbes estimated his fortune at $1 million in 2019. Virtually all of that came from state and federal pensions, the result of 18 years in public life, first as a U.S. representative, then as Indiana s governor, then as the country s vice president. Based on his first fourteen years as a federal employee, Pence was eligible to collect an estimated $50,000 per year for the rest of his life. For his four years of gubernatorial work, he was entitled to at least 30% of his salary, or about $35,000 annually.<figure><figcaption>Republican presidential candidate and former vice president Mike Pence.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.
