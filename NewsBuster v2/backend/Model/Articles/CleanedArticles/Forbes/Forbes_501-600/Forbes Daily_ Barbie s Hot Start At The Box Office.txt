Since legalizing cannabis in March 2021, New York has been slow issuing licenses, and the authorities have been light on enforcement. This environment has led to theproliferation of an estimated 3,500 unlicensed pot shopsacross the state.Elfand claims his business is operating legally without a license because of a legal loophole or what he and his lawyers call a  safe harbor  in the state law. Technically speaking,Empire is a private club and does not sell cannabis members pay a small fee to enter the store and any money exchanged for cannabis products is consideration, not financial compensation.Inside his club s Chelsea location hours after the raid, Elfand was unperturbed by the day s festivities.  I m the f ing king of New York,  he says.  I own the cannabis trade. Elfand says he is ready to prove that his business model is compliant with state law and argues that the federal government cannot charge him with marijuana-related crimes and not take down multibillion-dollar cannabis businesses like Curaleaf, Trulieve and Green Thumb Industries, without breaking the U.S. Constitution.Paul Armentano, the deputy director of the non-profit National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, dismisses much of Elfand s legal posturing.  Just because a law is a bad law doesn t make it unconstitutional,  he says.Yet, Paula Collins, a New York attorney who represents unlicensed cannabis business but is not involved with Empire, says club memberships can legally operate under New York s guidelines. We are going to see more activity a big legal fight,  says Collins.  This is not illicit cannabis. What they are calling illicit cannabis they have improperly defined in the law. WHY IT MATTERS If New York can successfully scale its recreational marijuana market, it wouldbecome the nation s second-largest regulated cannabis economyafter California with more than $4 billion in annual sales. But with only 19 licensed dispensaries for 19 million residents, the licensed industry and the paltry taxes that come from the struggling market are not yet living up to its promise.MORE Welcome To New York, The Wild West Of WeedFACTS AND COMMENTSThe U.S. Women s National Team is favored to win its third-straight Women s World Cup, and its players lookjust as unbeatableat the bank: they claim 11 of the 15 spots on the list of the highest-paid players at this summer s tournament.
