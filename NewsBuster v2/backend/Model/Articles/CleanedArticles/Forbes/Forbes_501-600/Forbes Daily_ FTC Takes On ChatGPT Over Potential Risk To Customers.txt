DAILY COVER STORY<figure><figcaption>Buff City Soap CEO Dorvin LivelyMICHAEL THAD CARTER FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Instead of hosting your child s next birthday at Chuck E. Cheese or Build-A-Bear Workshop, try a bath bomb-making party.Buff City Soap,a bakery-style retailer that makes soaps, bath bombs and laundry detergentin its stores, expanded rapidly during the pandemic, and now it s making a play to become a party destination. The chain went from 30 to 260 stores between 2019 and today.Almost all of them are run by franchisees, who are projected togenerate systemwide sales of over $150 million this year, according to the company. With backing from General Atlantic to fuel growth, it has set its sights on ultimately operating 1,000 stores.When customers come in, they see apron-clad employees behind the counter, whipping up body butter, cutting into freshly-made loaves of soap and lining giant sheet racks with bath bombs. Everything is plant-based and made fresh in stores daily, and customers can make special requests.The company is looking to grab market share in a space that is currently dominated by Bath & Body Works, but where others like Lush and Dr. Squatch have grown rapidly. Americans have shown that they rewilling to spend on inexpensive indulgences, even as the price of groceries, gas and other items have risen.However, Buff City has pumped the brakes on expansion until it can get some things in order, like working on bringing costs down for franchisees and reducing the payback period. It has brought on seasoned franchise operators like its CEO Dorvin Lively, who came from Planet Fitness.And while making products in front of customers is the brand s hallmark, itcarries risks for workers: lye, which is used to make soap, can cause severe burns if it comes into contact with someone s skin or gets into their eyes. The company has increased the amount of personal protective equipment that is made available to employees in recent years.Buff City is pushing for more parties while keeping the stores open during the events, which some employees say can be challenging to juggle. The company is moving fast to unveil new products, and whenever it does, it s not as simple as stocking shelves: employees must assemble the right ingredients and know how to make the product, package it and label it.WHY IT MATTERS  I hadn't heard of Buff City Soap until my family moved to Dallas, where they are headquartered, earlier this year,  saysForbes reporter Lauren Debter.  I was surprised to learn they had a whopping 260 locations, almost all of which were opened during the pandemic. That type of growth is unusual, and I wanted to understand what was fueling their success and whether they had grown too quickly. I discovered a retailer with a surprisingly refreshing spin on bricks and mortar and a heap more safety concerns, too.
