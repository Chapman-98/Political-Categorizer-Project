The message  set off a panic  at Fox and  contributed to a chain of events  that ultimately led to Carlson being fired on April 24, theTimesreports, noting the Fox Corp. board told Fox executives the day after discovering the text message that it was hiring an outside law firm to investigate Carlson s conduct.Chief CriticsCarlson s tweet has drawn widespread criticism, as well as a sense of unsurprise from his critics, who suggested Carlson s text was in line with his program and history of racially insensitive remarks.Author Stephen King called the message  despicable  in a tweet.Former Trump White House advisor Alyssa Farah Griffin said the text shows he  wasn t playing a character on TV,  saying the message  starts w/blatant racism, turns to him being gleeful over violence, then descends into him questioning his humanity or lack thereof for cheering someone s assault because they don t share his politics. The text s racism is  embedded in Fox s DNA,  journalist John Harwood tweeted, sharing a Fox News clip from Tuesday in which host Jesse Watters said he could  tell  a family he saw who was  digging through the trash  was an  illegal immigration family. What s not news is the fact that Tucker Carlson is a white nationalist,  Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt tweeted, adding,  What is news is the fact that this somehow is surprising to anyone. Fox execs apparently alarmed by the naked White supremacism... though if you've ever watched his show, would not be a surprise,  CNN anchor Abby Phillip, a sentiment shared by other journalists from outlets including Politico, HuffPost and NBC News.ContraOthers have painted theTimesreport as a part of a coordinated effort by Fox News to tarnish the ex-anchor s reputation though it's not clear how theTimesgot Carlson's text, or whether it was part of a deliberate leak by Fox.Fox  leaking  to the Times  isn't just an attack on Tucker, it's an attack on all of his fans and conservatives everywhere!  Donald Trump, Jr., tweeted.Journalist Glenn Greenwald a frequent guest on Carlson s show said the report was  obviously a decision by Fox to wage a massive war on Tucker Carlson's character,  a decision that he called  extremely odd for many reasons,  including because Carlson  hasn't uttered a negative word about them. Influencer Tristan Tate, brother of Andrew Tate, said on Twitter the reports about Carlson  have me confused  because they  make him seem human and relatable,  adding,  This attempt to defame him couldn t have been pulled off worse  and saying it looks like  a genius PR stunt by his team. Key BackgroundCarlson was suddenlyfiredlast week from Fox News with reportedly no notice, a shocking blow to the network s top anchor that came days after Fox agreed to pay $787.5 million to settle Dominion s defamation case against it. The  white men fight  message was not released publicly in court documents, but theTimesreports the Fox board was worried it could become public at the case s trial which was ultimately averted with the last-minutesettlement.
