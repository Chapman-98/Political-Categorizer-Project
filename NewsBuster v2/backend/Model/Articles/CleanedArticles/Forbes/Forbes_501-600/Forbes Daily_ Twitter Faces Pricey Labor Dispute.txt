FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE For decades, elite employers have treated elite universities as their main pipeline for entry-level talent  But if the Supreme Court s 6-to-3 decision in June ordering an end to race conscious college admissions leads to less diversity among their graduates, thetalent pipeline that companies rely onwill also become less diverse That means employers are going to have to recruit more widely if, that is, they re committed to maintaining at least the level of diversity in hiring they have now Just how narrow is today s pipeline? According to sociologist Lauren Rivera, who interviewed hiring officials at 120 top-tier professional service firms for her book, employers typically recruit extensively from only three to five of the most elite institutions, and then have a  target  group of another 5 to 15 schools, where they offer more limited recruiting and interview slots Seniors attending colleges that aren t in one of those two groups were usually stuck applying through a firm s website and were unlikely to get an interview unless they had a personal connection at the firm  Firms allocate specific numbers of interview slots and in many cases, offers to each campus before students  qualifications are ever reviewed,  Rivera toldForbes  Everyone else is left fighting for the scraps  In one campus newspaper ad, she points out, an investment bank advertised to Ivy League students with the tagline  no experience wanted  Recruiters focus on elite schools as a shortcut to identify applicants with  intellectual horsepower,  Rivera explains  Yet she says her ongoing research shows thatgraduates from elite institutions don t perform any betterthan graduates with other educational backgrounds once they start their jobs Plus, the Supreme Court s affirmative action decisioncould have a chilling effecton companies  own employee and board diversity initiatives, as they worry they ll be sued next WHY IT MATTERS  So much goes into gaining admission to and enrolling in an elite university that has nothing to do with a person s intelligence or work ethic and instead is based on opportunities that we know from decades of research aretilted in favor of children from white and wealthy families,   Rivera observes  Notably, the Supreme Court hasn t outlawed admission preferences for legacy applicants those whose parents or grandparents attended the school MORE: How The End Of Affirmative Action Reroutes The Talent PipelineFACTS AND COMMENTSAfter years of reluctance to work with third-party delivery companies,Domino s Pizza saidits menu items would beavailable on Uber Eats and Postmatesstarting this fall:10%: Increase to Domino s share price Wednesday following the announcement4: Number of pilot markets for the rollout, before it expands across the U S  by the end of the year$1 billion: Expected new revenue for the pizza chain as a result of the partnership, Russell Weiner, Domino s chief executive told theWall Street JournalSTRATEGY AND SUCCESSIf you re on the job market, there are a few best practices to consider when it comes to theformat and style of your résumé  Don t be afraid of white space, and resist the urge to pack it with too much text  Use headings, sub-headings, and bullet points  Above all, remember that recruiterswill spend just 6-8 secondsreviewing your résumé, so make it easy to find what matters VIDEOhttps://www forbes com/video/6331077131112/QUIZParts of the continental U S  had a rare chance to view the Northern Lights this week, though researchers largely backtracked on earlier predictions that they may have been visible in as many as 17 states  Which of the followingstates had a chance of seeing the natural phenomenon?A  New YorkB  South DakotaC  MontanaD  WyomingCheck your answer ACROSS THE NEWSROOMForbes' Future of Work newsletter will keep you up-to-speed on where the world of work is headed next  Click here to sign-up Thanks for reading!
