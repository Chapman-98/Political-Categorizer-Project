ToplineAn IRS whistleblower claimed to a House panel that the Justice Department slow-walked its investigation into Hunter Biden and treated him favorably because he is the president s son the latest piece of evidence in Republican-led investigations seeking to prove President Joe Biden s family members have used his influence to further their own business ventures and skirt the law, though the probes have yet to produce any verified claims of wrongdoing <figure><figcaption>Hunter Biden, son of U S  President Joe Biden, looks on during a state dinner at the White House on June 22, 2023 in

the committee has to suggest malfeasance swirling the Bidens, IRS agent Gary Shapley alleged the investigators recommended additional felonies for Hunter Biden to the Justice Department and said U S  attorneys offices in California and Washington, D C , declined to prosecute Hunter Biden, according to a transcript of Shapley s testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee released Thursday Shapley also detailed an incriminating WhatsApp message the agency allegedly obtained between Hunter Biden and his Chinese business partner, Henry Zhao, in 2017, after Joe Biden s tenure as vice president and before his election as president, in which Hunter Biden allegedly pressured Zhao to complete a business deal by invoking his father, who he claimed was sitting next to him and  waiting for the call,  according to a summary of the message Shapley provided to the committee A bribery scandal: Republicans allege a confidential FBI informant told the agency both Hunter Biden and his father accepted a $5 million bribe connected to Hunter Biden s dealings with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, according to an FBI document members of the House Oversight Committee were recently allowed to view that the agency has labeled  unverified   Intentionally complicated financial transactions : The House Oversight Committee alleges Hunter Biden, along with President Biden s daughter-in-law, Hallie Biden, and brother, James Biden, along with their associates, set up over a dozen companies while Joe Biden was vice president that received more than $10 million from foreign entities through  incremental payments over time to different bank accounts  activity he claimed, without evidence, was intended to complicate and conceal the transactions Payments from foreign nationals: The committee claims companies affiliated with Biden family members and their associates received money from companies with  significant ties to Chinese intelligence and the Chinese Communist Party,  along with payments from individuals in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Romania and Russia, which Oversight Chairman Rep  James Comer (R-Ky ) has alleged is evidence of  influence peddling  by pointing to federal government activity that relates to some of the foreign individuals Biden received money from, though it s unclear what evidence the committee has gathered to prove the transactions were illegal or unethical For example, the committee has taken issue with Hunter Biden s role in the 2016 sale of an American-operated coal mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo to a Chinese company, noting that the  Obama Administration was aware of cobalt s importance to the global economy, but did nothing to intervene in Hunter Biden s Chinese-backed transaction  Comer crafted the narrative surrounding Hunter, James and Hallie Biden by subpoenaing suspicious activity reports banks are required to file with the federal government when they suspect potentially illegal activity, though the reports themselves are fairly commonplace and automatically filed with larger financial transactions Chief CriticPresident Biden has repeatedly said he has never been involved in his family s business dealings  He recently called the bribery claims a  bunch of malarkey  News PegThe Delaware U S  Attorney s office announced Tuesday that Hunter Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges of failing to file approximately $1 million in taxes in 2017 and 2018 and will enter a diversion program to avoid a charge for illegally purchasing a gun as a drug user  Many Republicans, including Comer and former President Donald Trump, blasted the plea deal as a  sweetheart deal  and accused the Justice Department of letting Hunter Biden off with a  slap on the wrist  because he is the president s son, even though the case was handled by Trump-appointed attorney David Weiss  The House Oversight Committee vowed to continue its years-long investigations into the Biden family in the wake of the plea deal ContraLegal experts have said it s rare for the Justice Department to prosecute people for the charges Hunter Biden faces, especially given his status as a first-time offender, willingness to admit guilt and the fact he has paid back the taxes he owed the IRS  He is unlikely to face jail time and prosecutors are expected to recommend probation for the two tax charges Key BackgroundRepublicans have targeted Hunter Biden for years as they seek to link the president s troubled younger son to his work in politics  Hunter Biden s former position on Burisma s board has become a focal point for the GOP and played a role in Trump s first impeachment after he urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Burisma and Hunter Biden, according to a House investigation  The investigation also found Trump withheld military assistance to Ukraine in order to put pressure on Zelensky  The allegations reached a fever pitch when theNew York Post reported in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election that materials from a laptop it claimed belonged to Hunter Biden suggested Joe Biden had contact with Hunter Biden s Ukrainian business partners What To Watch For After the House tabled a measure to impeach Biden on Thursday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif ) suggested impeachment could come later if the House Judiciary
