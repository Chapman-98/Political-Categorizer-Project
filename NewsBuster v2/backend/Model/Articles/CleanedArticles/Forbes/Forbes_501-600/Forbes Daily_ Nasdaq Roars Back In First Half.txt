Cryptos Are Securities But Proving It Will Be Difficult<figure><figcaption>Charles Hoskinson, Founder, Cardano, on Crypto stage during day two of Web Summit 2022 at the Altice Arena in Lisbon,

dozens of cryptocurrencies as securities as itcracks down on the digital assets industry, but provided very little explanation for how they came to that conclusion If the cryptos fall in the legal definition of a security, it would require the issuers to register them with the SEC or meet the requirements for an exemption  The SEC is suing crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase,alleging they operated as unregistered exchanges With the addition of tokens named in its lawsuits against the two prominent crypto exchanges, the number of assets the agency deems securities is at least 65, according to Berenberg, a Hamburg-based bank, including major cryptocurrencies such as bnb,busd, cardano, solana and polygon  They collectively account formore than $100 billion in market value  By naming such a broad swath of differentiated tokens, the SEC is effectively signaling to the market that it regards most tokens as securities,  says Mike Selig, counsel at New York-based law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said the "vast majority" of crypto tokens meet the Howey test, a set of standards used to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract and is thus considered a security  An "investment contract" exists when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others  We will likely continue to see new tokens offered and sold as non-securities under new legal theories until theSEC or Congresssteps in to create aworkable regulatory frameworkfor crypto asset securities,  Selig says WHY IT MATTERS  The clampdown has been costly to the digital-assets industry,  saysForbesreporter Nina Bambysheva   The 19 cryptocurrencies named in the SEC s cases against Binance and Coinbase have lost a combined $5 billion in value since the filing of the complaints in early June and include major tokens such as bnb, busd, cardano, solana and polygon, which collectively account for more than a $100 billion in market value a sizable chunk of the $1 2 trillion industry  Asthe crackdown intensifies, crypto companies are exploring plans to expand internationally and possibly move entirely  For example, last month, Coinbase opened a business in Bermuda  MOREBinance Judge Seeks To Avoid U S  Asset Freeze, But Crypto Exchange Faces Lengthy Court
