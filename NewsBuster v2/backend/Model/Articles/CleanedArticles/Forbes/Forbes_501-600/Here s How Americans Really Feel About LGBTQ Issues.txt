Approximately 1.6% of U.S. adults identify as transgender or nonbinary, according to aPew pollconducted in May 2022. PRRI spolling which put the share of LGBTQ Americans higher than Gallup s number, at 10% found LGBTQ Americans are more than twice as likely as the general population to be 30 years old or younger, and 28% are Generation-Z.

If past is prologue, we can say that we re looking at an 8- to 10-year time line,  American University professor Andrew Flores, who s studied public opinion on LGBTQ issues, told thePost. People becoming more familiar with trans issues and forming more personal connections with transgender and nonbinary people will likely help drive up public opinion, with the Post/KFF poll finding that 43% of its poll respondents personally know a transgender person, and those respondents were more likely to believe gender isn t necessarily assigned at birth (53%, versus 35% of respondents overall).Key BackgroundConservative efforts to scapegoat LGBTQ Americans specificallyfocusing on trans kids has become an animating effort in American politics, eagerly embraced by GOP presidential candidates, and likely to extend through the next election cycle. State lawmakers have ramped up bills that that restrictgender-affirming carein 20 states, target drag performances and restrict classroom instruction on LGBTQ topics, among other measures. And conservative activists have also begun to increasingly target corporations: Bud Light drewcriticismfrom the right for partnering with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney; Disney has been in ayear-long battlewith the Florida government (and its governor in particular) after the company spoke out against the state s Parental Rights in Education law, and Targetannouncedit would remove or move some of its Pride merchandise after it had resulted in store employees being harassed, sparking criticism from LGBTQ advocates andextremism experts. As this year s Pride celebrations get under way, organizers of events inseveralÂ citiessay they plan to increase security in response to the heightened tensions over LGBTQ rights. Some events in Florida have beencanceledin response to concerns over recently passed anti-LGBTQ legislation which restricts gender-affirming care, drag performances and expanded the educational restrictions in the  Don t Say Gay  law, among other measures and LGBTQ organizations have also issuedtravel advisoriesfor the state.Further ReadingNebraska Becomes Latest State To Restrict Gender-Affirming Care Here Are All The States With Similar Bans Or Restrictions(Forbes)Target Removes Pride Items After Conservative Firestorm Sparking Criticism From LGBTQ Groups(Forbes)More Acceptance but Growing Polarization on LGBTQ Rights: Findings From the 2022 American Values Atlas(PRRI)About six-in-ten Americans say legalization of same-sex marriage is good for society(Pew Research Center)Most trans adults say transitioning made them more satisfied with their lives(Washington Post)Most Americans support anti-trans policies favored by GOP, poll shows(Washington Post)
