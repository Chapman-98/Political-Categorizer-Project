Terje RÃ¸d-Larsen, a Norwegian diplomat who resigned from his role as president of the International Peace Institute in 2020 after his ties to Epstein were publicized, was at Epstein s New York townhouse so often from 2013 to 2017 that the staff knew to have cucumbers around for his gin, theJournalreported, and he didn t answer requests to comment.After Epstein s 2019 arrest, co-founder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman said he had only met with Epstein to help raise funds for MIT, but new documents show Epstein had planned for Hoffman to visit his island twice and that Hoffman was once scheduled to stay at Epstein s townhouse and attended a  breakfast party;  Hoffman told theJournalhe visited the island just once to fundraise for MIT and said he is sorry for his  personal misjudgment  regarding Epstein.Leon Black, billionaire co-founder of Apollo Global Management who has beenaccusedof raping a woman at Epstein s estate, had scheduled more than 100 meetings with Epstein from 2013 to 2017, per the documents, and declined to comment to theJournal.Key Background Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell in 2019 after being indicted on federal sex trafficking and sex conspiracy charges, was known to hang around other big names in finance, technology and politics, many of whom have since tried todistancethemselves from him. Since news broke of his sex trafficking ring, there have been accusations that Prince Andrew, Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, Alan Dershowitz, Donald Trump and more had close relationships with the financier and may have attended  parties  at Epstein s homes. Epstein also faced a 2007 federal sex crimes indictment in which he was accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls and resulted in a brief stint in a Florida jail and the requirement he register as a sex offender, though the plea deal was criticized as too lenient.TangentTheWall Street Journalhas reviewed two batches of Epstein documents that provide insight into his personal and business life. The last round ofreporting, published on Sunday, revealed that the CIA director, Goldman Sachs  top lawyer, Noam Chomsky, the Bard College president, a staffer at Henry Kissinger s consulting firm and an executive at the bank Edmond de Rothschild Group all spent time with Epstein after he was a convicted sex offender. The thousands of pages of documents from 2013 to 2017 that reporters reviewed hadn t been previously reported. In most cases, the documents don t reveal the purpose of the meetings and theJournalwas unable to verify if each scheduled meeting took place. But many of the people who appeared on the calendars told reporters  they met with Epstein for reasons related to his wealth and connections.
