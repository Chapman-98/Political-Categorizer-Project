Apple<figure><figcaption>Masimo CEO Joe KianiETHAN PINES FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE When Apple was in the process ofdeveloping the Apple Watchand exploring ways to incorporate different health sensors, it met with 28 firms, including medical technology company Masimo  Internally, Apple executives were weighing acquiring Masimo, but ultimately decided against it because Masimo s hospital-focused products were outside of Apple s core consumer focus A decade later, Apple and the company it rejected areembroiled in a multi-front legal battleover the Apple Watch  Joe Kiani, Masimo s founder and CEO, has alleged that Apple poached his employees, stole trade secrets and infringed on Masimo s patents related to pulse oximetry and noninvasive measurements  Apple has denied the charges and the trade secrets case ended in a mistrial in May, though Kiani has vowed a retrial These legal fights come as Kiani, whoForbesestimates is worth $1 2 billion, is starting to enter the consumer space with a $499  health watch  released last August and a $999 smartwatch expected to come out this fall, as well as a range of other wearables Apple commands over 56% of the global smartwatch market, which is expected to hit $33 billion in 2023, according to research firm IDC A decision expected in mid-July from The International Trade Commission could be a turning point: the commission is reviewing an earlier decision from a judge that found Apple infringed on two of Masimo s patent claims  If the agency sides with Masimo, it couldpotentially result in an import ban of certain Apple Watches After three decades selling to hospitals, Kiani is taking a huge gamble on the future of Masimo s business, andWall Street is skeptical  Activist investor Politan Capital Management, led by Quentin Koffey, took a 9% stake in Masimo worth around $800 million  Politan won two board seats this week following a heated proxy battle, where the firm criticized Masimo s  unfocused strategy  Masimo s devices accurately measure vital signs for hospital patients and Kiani wants people with chronic disease to get similarly precise measurements from a smartwatch  The end goal of the consumer tech push, he says, is to  close the circle from hospital to home to hospital  WHY IT MATTERS  The patent fight highlights a bigger trend of Big Tech companies getting into healthcare,  saysForbesreporter Katie Jennings   IDC estimates the global wearables market will hit $63 billion in 2023  While the Apple Watch currently leads the market, other efforts, like Amazon s Halo band have sputtered and shutdown   Rather than target the general population, Kiani is hoping that where Masimo can make a dent is consumers who want accurate and continuous monitoring of their health, including people with chronic conditions or athletes  He likens it to how certain people choose Garmin s smartwatch because it s known to have the best GPS capabilities   We're trying to create a serious product for serious people,  Kiani says  MOREMeet The Iranian Immigrant Who Became A Covid MedTech BillionaireFACTS AND COMMENTSA study to measure howsusceptible people are to
