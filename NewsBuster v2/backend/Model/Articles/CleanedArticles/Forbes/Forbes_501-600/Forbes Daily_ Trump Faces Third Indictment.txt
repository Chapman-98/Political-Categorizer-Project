Forbes 30 Under 30 alum Arthur Kuan JAMEL TOPPIN FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Every year, over 80,000 Americans are diagnosed with it  Nearly 800,000 Americans are living with it and some 16,000 will likely die from it  It s the6th most common cancer in the country  And yet, you rarely hear people talk about bladder cancer, says Gary Steinberg, a urologist on the faculty of Rush Medical College That s in part, he says, because of the embarrassment people have around its impact on their normal bodily functions  Nevertheless, he says, it can be a devastating disease  The treatments available aren t much different than they were in the 1970s  But Steinberg is advising a startup focused on a potential new treatment: an immunotherapy developed by Irvine, California-based CG Oncology that s been designed to treat bladder cancer  In clinical trials so far, the companyhas seen promising resultsin patients whose disease doesn t respond to other treatments If all goes well, the drug may be on the market as early as 2026  To help it get there, CG Oncology announced Wednesday that it hasraised a $105 million crossover financing roundco-led by TCGX and Foresite Capital  The market in bladder cancer is so underserved that it s really a blue ocean,  says CEO Arthur Kuan, a 32-year-old alumnus of the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in Healthcare The basis of CG Oncology s treatment for bladder cancer isa genetically engineered virus  The virus targets a specific genetic signature that s only found in bladder cancer cells, which it attacks and destroys  That destruction releases chemical triggers that cause the body s immune system to attack other tumor cells, creating a one-two punch that helps prevent the cancer from returning CG Oncology expects it will have final results from its current clinical trials by the fourth quarter of 2024  If those are positive, Kuan says, the company will then apply for approval from the FDA WHY IT MATTERS Michael Rome, a partner at Foresite Capital, says that CG Oncology s results so far and its gameplan for the futureput it in a rare place among biotech startups   I don t see private companies that are in as late state development as CG,  he says MORE:This Startup Just Raised $32 Million To Keep Cancers From Recurring After SurgeryFACTS AND COMMENTSWarehouse automation firm Symbotic, which works with
