SportLEVON BISS FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Eddie Hearn, the chairman of his family s event promotion company, Matchroom Sport, has pushed the firm s boundaries topreviously unimaginable heights Forbesestimates Matchroom Sport posted revenue of $365 million and a net profit of $60 million in fiscal year 2023 (ended June 30) Much of that is thanks to the rejuvenation of its boxing division, which he has steered since 2012 from small-time enterprise to global brand  Boxing now accounts for over half ($235 million) of Matchroom Sport s estimated annual sales and nearly $20 million of its cash flow It is the biggest name in U K  boxing, a nascent yet profitable player in America and an emerging presence in newer markets such as the Middle East It s the kind of success his father, Barry, never envisioned when the elder Hearn founded the company in 1982  Starting with just £100 and a focus on snooker, and later darts and other small sports, Barry assembled a respectable promotion business that was pulling in roughly $1 million in profit on $10 million of revenue when Eddie joined Matchroom in 2000 Twelve years later, when Eddie first approached his dad with a radical plan to blow out the firm s boxing operations, the entire company was earning less ($7 million net profit on $46 million revenue) than it does solely in the ring today   I always had dreams,  Barry, 75, says   But Eddie s shown me that there is another level  WHY IT MATTERS  Over the last decade, boxing has found itself as the cultural undercard to mixed martial arts in the UFC and, in a way, Matchroom hasinjected new life into a sport many believe is stagnating, or even dying,  saysForbesreporter Justin Birnbaum   Much like UFC or WWE, Hearn s vision for Matchroom is on a global scale and it s pushing the company toward his ultimate goal of taking the company public  FACTS AND COMMENTSTwo major steps were taken recently tobring light to and treat postpartum depression
