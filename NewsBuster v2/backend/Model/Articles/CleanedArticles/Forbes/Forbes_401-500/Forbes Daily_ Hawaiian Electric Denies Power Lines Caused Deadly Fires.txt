to shine: its state higher education system Four of the University of California s 10 campusesearned a spot in the top 25on Forbes  2023 America s Top Colleges list: the University of California Berkeley (No  5); the University of California, Los Angeles (No  7); the University of California, San Diego (No  21); and the University of California, Santa Barbara (No  24)  All eight Ivy League colleges made the top 25, but only one other public school the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (No  23) made that cut No public university system dominates our list like California s  Among our top 100 for 2023, 44 schools are public  Remarkably, 12 of those 44 are in California California can thank both history andForbes  methodology for its success  Our ranking approach, which we significantly revamped three years ago, is designed to identify schools that enroll students from across the socioeconomic spectrum who then go on to graduate, earn high salaries and become leaders in their fields without spending their young adult years drowning in student debt Like many other states, California slashed its higher education funding in the wake of the Great Recession  With a 1988 voter-passed state proposition requiring adequate support for community colleges, the state s four-year colleges were hit particularly hard  Theyresponded by raising tuition  The highly ranked UCs, particularly Berkeley and UCLA, also raised their acceptance of out-of-state students, who pay higher tuition than in-state residents The listed tuition for the top California UCs is relatively high compared to other states  universities  Tuition and fees for Berkeley this coming year total $15,602 for California residents and $48,176 for out-of-staters Not everything is hunky-dory in California, of course  The state is still struggling with astudent housing shortageso severe that some students are living in their cars, and a planned further expansion of grants could be endangered by looming budget deficits  But for now, the state s efforts andForbes approach to ranking schoolskeep the California UCs near the top WHY IT MATTERS  Year after year, many college rankings tout the Ivy League as unmatchable institutions for soon-to-be undergraduates,  saysForbesreporter Emma Whitford   Don t get me wrong, they are excellent schools Princeton University snagged the top spot onForbes  Top
