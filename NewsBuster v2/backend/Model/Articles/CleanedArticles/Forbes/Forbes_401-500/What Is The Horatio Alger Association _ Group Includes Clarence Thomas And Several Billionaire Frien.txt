For years, Thomas enjoyed free travel at Crow s expense. The justice stayed at Crow s resort and traveled on Crow s private jet and superyacht, the investigation found. But Thomas did not disclose any of these gifts as some experts said federal law requires (Thomas has said he didn t disclose the travel because he believed it fell under an exemption for personal hospitality). ProPublica alsoreportedCrow paid for two years of tuition for Thomas  grandnephew Mark Martin without disclosing the payments, and Thomas and his familysolda number of properties in Savannah, Georgia, to Crow in 2014 without disclosing the sale. These revelations, as well as existing criticism about Thomas  wife Ginni s right-wing activism, led to calls from many Democrats to institute a code of ethics for justices to be bound to. Meanwhile, Republicans accused Democrats of leveling a partisan campaign against Thomas and conservative justices because of the court s new conservative tilt.
