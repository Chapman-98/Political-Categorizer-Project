office enhancementsince air conditioners Its smart windows could tint the windows of an entire building according to the position of the sun, promising to keep rooms cooler, and generate vast energy savings  With built-in, transparent circuit boards, the panes also transformed into a giant computer or presentation screens But suchambitions have been shattered  The company reportedly laid off almost a quarter of its workforce earlier this year  And last week, View settled charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that alleged its former CFO misstated the costs of replacing  many  defective windows by $28 million Despite cost cutting and fundraising efforts,View appears to be facing an existential crisis: It has received warnings from Nasdaq that it could be delisted, and the company recently said it doesn t have enough money to fund operations beyond September  And its stock price has torpedoed after peaking at $12 49 in 2021, now trading at 13 cents, as of Monday  It
