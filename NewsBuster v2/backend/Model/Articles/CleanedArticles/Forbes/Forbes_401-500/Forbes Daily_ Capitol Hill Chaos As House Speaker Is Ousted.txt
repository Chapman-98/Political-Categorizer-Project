STORYZoom s Founder Turns To AI In Hopes Of Regaining Pandemic Highs<figure><figcaption>Zoom founder and CEO Eric YuanETHAN PINES FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE In the early days of the pandemic, Zoom was a software savior, and founder and CEO Eric Yuan becamethe face of remote work and education with a soaring stock and privacy concerns to go with it But software tools debuted in the months after its massive influx of users haven t panned out quite as hoped  From an all-time high of $568 that October, giving it a market capitalization of about $160 billion, Zoom s stock has leveled out over the past year at about $70, or a market cap just over $20 billion Now, Yuan is looking to navigate Zoom s future in a different direction:life as a  communication and collaboration  platform Zoom s headliner new product in that effort is Zoom Docs, which the company said it will make generally available in 2024  Users can generate a new Zoom Doc from within a video meeting or chat, and populate it with relevant content and action items using Zoom s artificial intelligence copilot  Another AI-powered new feature, a generative whiteboard, allows teams to auto-populate and organize a project visually from such a meeting Zoom s also recognized thatcustomers increasingly prefer hybrid work, Yuan said  Zoom itself made for easy punchlines when it announced a return to the office twice a week in August   We needed to eat our own dog food,  Yuan said By offering new office management tools for everything from visitor check-in to booking desks and offices, Zoom will compete with a crowded number of software solutions  Zoom Docs appears to overlap with use cases of other work software tools such as Coda, Notion, Google s G Suite and Microsoft s 365 offerings, and even project management players like Asana and Monday com  Everyone s adding AI companions or copilots, too Even in the face of wider competition, such product expansion makes sense for Zoom, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria   Zoom s goal is toget people to use Zoom in a bigger way, so it s not a tool that you click as a link and then use and exit,  he said WHY IT MATTERS  Zoom s evolution after catching lightning in a bottle during the pandemic is interesting not just for what it says about the publicly traded company, but also the evolving future of work,  saysForbessenior editor Alex Konrad   Forbeswas there at Nasdaq when Zoom went public in 2019 and broke the viral news a year later when CEO Eric Yuan made it available to schools for free  Today, he cares as deeply about delivering a product customers want   but he s also grappling with the expectations of Zoom s ubiquity during Covid-19  It s hard not to see Zoom today as stillin the shadow of its own success,but it s doing what it can to stay relevant and offer new forms of utility for customers  MOREThe War Over Work From Home: The Data CEOs And Workers Need To KnowFACTS AND COMMENTSSeptember
