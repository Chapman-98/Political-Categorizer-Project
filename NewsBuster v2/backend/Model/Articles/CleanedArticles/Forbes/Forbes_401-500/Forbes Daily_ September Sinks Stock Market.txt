Universal adds a thirteenth month of revenue each autumn by terrifying the hell out of its theme park visitors around the world.Universal</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE For some people, Halloween means Pumpkin Spice Lattes, adorable trick-or-treaters and home-decorating tips from Martha Stewart. But for millions of horror fans, the season is all about jump scares, blood-thirsty ghouls and chainsaw-wielding clowns.This burgeoning crowd of fright seekers is the target audience for Universal theme parks, where the art of scaring the bejeezus out of guests has become a massive profit driverduring what was once a down time of year.Industry watchers estimate that Universal spends more than $100 million every year to stage, market and staff its Halloween Horror Nights (HHN) events at its theme parks in Florida, California, Japan and Singapore.The event has grown substantially in popularity and scope since debuting in 1991 as  Fright Nights  at Universal Orlando Resort, a three-day event with a single haunted house. This year, the Florida resort is presenting 10 haunted houses and street party-style  scare zones  across a record-breaking 48 nights five more than last year.Analysts estimate that 30,000 to 35,000 visitors attend HHN each night, which translates to some1.5 million visitors over the duration of the event and that s just in Florida. As a separately ticketed nighttime event, HHN essentially lets Universal more than double its attendance.Universal s success with HHN dovetails with two notable cultural trends: America s obsession with Halloween, and a resurgence in the popularity of horror films, especially among younger audiences.For Universal, this is a key competitive advantage over other theme park operators. Through Universal Studios, the company still owns many of the classic horror characters from the early 1930s Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, Wolfman, The Invisible Man.Perhaps the biggest testament to the success of HHN is that Universal is building a permanent 110,000-square-foot Halloween Horror Nights venue to open year-round in Las Vegas, with an eye to expanding to other domestic and international locations. Ultimately,  says Mike Aiello, senior director of creative development at Universal Orlando s entertainment division,  what we want is forpeople to have one of the best Halloween parties they've ever had in their life. WHY IT MATTERS  Every autumn, Halloween Horror Nights reminds the world that Universal and horror go together like blood and guts,  saysForbesstaff writer Suzanne Rowan Kelleher.  The event leverages Universal's roster of classic horror characters, such as Dracula, Frankenstein and The Mummy, as well as modern fright films like Jordan Peele sNope,The Black PhoneandHalloween Ends. As Robert Niles, founder of Theme Park Insider, told me: Universal wants people thinking Universal and horror, just like you think Disney and princesses. The result is a perennial fan-favorite blockbuster that adds an estimated $575 million in revenue to the company's coffers.
