Key BackgroundThe Sound of Freedom is based on Ballard, a former government agent, and his pursuit to save children from human trafficking. But the film has been criticized for its apparent ties to theQAnon conspiracytheory, which promotes the idea that Satan-worshiping political and media elites run the world and are involved in a child sex trafficking ring. Caviezel hasreportedlyspoken at multiple QAnon events, where he has promoted the QAnon theory that child traffickers drain their victims  blood to develop adrenochrome, a chemical theorists believe Hollywood elites inject to stay young. Ballard has also previouslysuggestedsupport for the debunked Wayfair conspiracy theory, which posited the furniture retailer was selling children online. Angel Studios denied any connection to QAnon or politics, and Ballard told Peterson he disavows much of what he sees with conspiracy theories, but affirmed his belief in the adrenochrome harvesting theory. A Viceinvestigationalso suggested Ballard s organization, Operation Underground Railroad, has exaggerated its role in sex trafficking rescue missions, and multiple law enforcement agencies told Vice their work with OUR has been  insubstantial.  Ballard criticized the Vice article as  very incredibly dishonest.  Utah s Davis County Attorney s Office reportedlyinvestigatedOUR for more than two years for alleged communications fraud, witness tampering and retaliation, but ended the investigation in May with no charges.TangentSome Sound of Freedomviewers accused AMC of deliberately sabotaging screenings of the film ostensibly to censor it or hurt its performance. AMC has forcefully denied these allegations, with CEO Adam Aroncallingit a  conspiracy theory  on Twitter. But viewers still allege issues like broken air conditioning, inaudibly low volume and refunded tickets have been among problems at AMC locations.
