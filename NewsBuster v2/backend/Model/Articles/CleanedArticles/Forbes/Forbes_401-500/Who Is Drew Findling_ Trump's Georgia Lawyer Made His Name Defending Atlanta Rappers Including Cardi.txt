Crucial Quote Trump attacked Willis onTruth Socialas an  out of control and very corrupt District Attorney who campaigned and raised money on,  I will get Trump   after the indictment was unsealed Monday. He has also coined the nickname  Phoney Fani  to refer to Willis and has called her a racist.Key BackgroundTrump was indicted Monday by Willis s office in its long-running probe into his efforts to subvert President Joe Biden s 2020 win in the state. He and 18 other co-defendants, including his ex-attorney Rudy Giuliani and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, were charged with racketeering in the case, a statute often used to convict mobsters. Trump was charged with 12 other felony counts, including conspiracy to commit false statements and writings and solicitation of a violation of oath by a public officer, a charge that stems from his efforts to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and House Speaker David Ralston to help him undo the election results. The indictment Trump s fourth since announcing his latest run for the White House lists a total of 41 crimes between the 19 defendants, all of whom are required to surrender to the District Attorney s office by August 25 and are expected to be booked in the Fulton County Jail.What To Watch ForHow Trump and his legal team will defend him against the indictment in Georgia. Findling previously suggested tothe he would lean on the First Amendment to validate Trump s infamous January 2021 call with Raffensperger, in which Trump asked him to  find  the 11,780 votes he needed to tip the results in his favor. Findling characterized Trump s request as a bid to  negotiate a resolution  and compared it to a rap song taken out of context.  Somebody listens to a rap song that lasts for four minutes and 11 seconds and pulls one verse out and tries to conjure up some type of criminal case out of it,  he said.Further Reading On the Run with Trump's  Billion-Dollar Lawyer (New Yorker)Atlanta s #BillionDollarLawyer Is Looking Out for Your Favorite Rappers(New York Times)Trump Indicted In Georgia: Here Are The Crimes He s Been Charged With And The Prison Sentences They Carry(Forbes)
