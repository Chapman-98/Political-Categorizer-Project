Profitable<figure><figcaption>Gatik CEO and cofounder Gautam NarangTREVOR PAUKLHUS FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Self-driving vehicles were supposed to revolutionize transportation  But robotaxi fleets in San Francisco are getting blamed for snarling intersections andcreating headaches for emergency vehicles  Promising robot truck startups are either dialing back plans or failing outright  Industry giants like Alphabet s Waymo and General Motors-backed Cruise have raised billions of dollars to improve the AI powering their systems but won t share hard targets for profitability And then there s Gatik The upstart with a Sanskrit name meaning  progressive  or  fast  is headquartered in a small commercial building in Mountain View, California  Unlike bigger neighbor Waymo, based nearby at the Google X campus, it s not developing robotic taxis or semis  Instead,its focus is unglamorous  middle mile  deliveries, using a fleet of some 50 trucks to haul goods from warehouses to grocery stores, big box retailers, post offices and fast food chains Gatik s raised at least $115 million less than a tenth of the money that s gone into Waymo, Cruise and Amazon s self-driving competitor Zoox  Butrevenue should be in the  high single-digit millions  this year, CEO and cofounder Gautam Narang toldForbes He s targeting up to $100 million in revenue within five years based onmultiyear contracts with Walmart, Kroger, Pitney Bowes,Canada s Loblaws supermarket chain and a few other big retailers he declined to name  Narang s also got a pretty good idea of how soon the company could be in the black WHY IT MATTERS Launched in 2017 by Narang, 32, his brother and CTO Arjun Narang and chief engineer Apeksha Kumavat, Gatik has taken what seems a radically different approach to mastering autonomous driving: do the easy things first  Haul goods, not people; operate on fixed city routes at speeds below 50 miles per hour; route around tricky or dangerous intersections and avoid fire stations and schools Spurred by continued growth in e-commerce and online grocery shopping, middle-mile delivery demand from retailers and supermarket chains is rising faster than Gatik customers like Pitney Bowes can find human drivers   Our biggest challenge right now is being able to ramp up quickly, says Narang MOREFirefighters Say Cruise Robotaxi Delayed
