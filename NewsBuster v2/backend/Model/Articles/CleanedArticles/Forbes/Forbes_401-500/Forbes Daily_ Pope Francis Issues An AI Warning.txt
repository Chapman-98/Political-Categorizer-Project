Repayments<figure><figcaption>BING GUAN/BLOOMBERG</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE This October, when student loan payments resume,Gen Zers could be in for shock and confusion The Pew Research Center reports that Gen Z, born between 1997 and 2012, is on track to be the most college educated generation ever  According to the College Board, in 202154% of new bachelor s degree recipients graduated with debt averaging $29,100 Like older student debtors, many of these Gen Zers had been counting on President Biden s student loan forgiveness proposal, which the Supreme Court shot down on June 30, that would have canceled up to $20,000 of their debt The Biden administration s new income driven repayment (IDR) planreduces monthly payments to a maximum of 10% of a participant s incomeover 225% of the federal poverty line  The catch, with SAVE and other IDR programs, is that a borrower could have to keep paying for 20 years, or 25 years, if they have graduate school debt Some Gen Zers may look torepayment assistance from their employers  When the Employee Benefit Research Institute surveyed 250 companies with at least 500 workers in June and July of 2022, it found 27% were already offering the student loan repayment benefit, another 25% planned to start doing so in 2023 or 2024, and an additional 22% were interested in the benefit, though they didn t yet have definite plans to offer it Problem is, a lot of struggling Gen Zers with student debtdon t have jobs at big companies with cushy benefits  Darius Brockett graduated in 2022 with a bachelor s degree in multimedia journalism from Morgan State University, a historically Black college, and is working in a paid internship, but has yet to find a regular entry-level position HBCU students are far more likely to need to take out loans,which perpetuates the racial wealth gap  I think the Black community, specifically HBCUs, will feel more of the effect [of the end of the student loan moratorium] than students at other schools,  says Travis A  Richard, director of financial aid at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, an HBCU WHY IT MATTERS  Many Gen Zers have never had to make payments on their student debt and a lot of them thought (before the Supreme Court shot down the Biden Administration s debt forgiveness plan) they wouldn t have to,  saysForbesstaffer Jah'I Selassie   The Biden Administration has taken steps to make paying based on what you earn less onerous  But the plan is confusing it means paying for 20 or 25 years What impact will this have on Gen Z s life plans?Will this keep them from getting advanced graduate degrees? Will they put off life milestones like marriage and kids?
