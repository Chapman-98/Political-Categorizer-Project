Road<figure><figcaption>Apoorva Mehta in 2021 CHRISTIE HEMM KLOK FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Instacart s $9 9 billion IPO is anew chapter for the grocery delivery giant, and one that founder and former CEO Apoorva Mehta is walking away from Mehta hasn t given an interview since stepping down as CEO in July 2021, when he handed the company reins to Fidji Simo, the longtime Meta executive who ran the Facebook app  He s been serving as executive chairman since then, with the intention of leaving the board after Instacart listed on the public markets On Tuesday, when Instacart went public, raising $660 million in a $9 9 billion IPO, he made good on that promise  And in an exclusive interview withForbes, Mehta addressed controversy that has long swirled around his departure  A lot of people have said that perhaps I was pushed out of the company  The reality is,if I wanted to be the CEO of Instacart, I would be the CEO of Instacart   He left, he says, because his new startup, a still-unlaunched digital health company called Cloud Health Systems, demanded his  singular focus  Going public was a dream Mehta may or may not have wanted, depending on who you ask Mehta still stands to make a fortune, though his net worth has fallen with Instacart s valuation drop Instacart achieved a longtime Silicon Valley dream that had eluded the tech industry since the dot-com bubble: on-demand grocery delivery  Eventually, it became a pandemic darling, and the company s business grew 400% as the pandemic ballooned, Mehta said That success which also came with controversies around sourcing protective equipment for its shoppers and bait-and-switch tipping scams helpedvault Instacart to a $39 billion valuation in 2021  But the luster began to fade as lockdowns ended and people began to venture out into the world again Now the company is going public at only 25% of that valuation, with its IPO priced at $30 per share  Instacart shares opened 40% higher than their list price, and ended the day up 12% WHY IT MATTERS  This is the first time Mehta has addressed the circumstances around his departure, stepping down in 2021 after he clashed with Sequoia's former top boss Michael Moritz over the future of the company,  saysForbessenior writer Richard Nieva   As Instacart goes public, it faces a new set of challenges, includingslowing growth and formidable rivals The
