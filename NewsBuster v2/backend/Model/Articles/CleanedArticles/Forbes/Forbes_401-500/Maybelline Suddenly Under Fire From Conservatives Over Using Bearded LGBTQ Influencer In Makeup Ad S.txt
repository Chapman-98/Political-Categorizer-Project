Another day, another disturbing make-up ad,  Chen wrote, sparking outrage from her followers and other conservatives who have also shared the video alongside comments slamming the company as  woke  and accusing it of virtue signaling.But Maybelline has used members of the LGBTQ community and men to market its products for years (includingsome who arebearded), most notably in 2017, when it enlisted Manny Gutierrez, known for his popular  Manny Mua  YouTube channel with nearly 5 million subscribers, as itsfirst male starof a marketing campaign.Gutierrez, who led Maybelline s Big Shot Mascara by Colossal campaign, was one of several male-focused beauty advertising campaigns at the time,Glamour reported, includingCoverGirl enlisting influencer James Charles as itsfirst male modelin October 2016 and Giorgio Armani launching a Her/Him lipcare line that fall.Maybelline has also used plenty of other LGBTQ stars in promotional materials, including drag starTrixie Mattel, trans makeup artistNikkie de Jager(known primarily by her YouTube channel name, NikkieTutorials), as well as trans influencerDylan Mulvaney, who has been a primary target of anti-trans backlash this year for numerous brand partnerships chiefly one with Bud Light that s led to boycotts of the beer.Some protests against LGBTQ-inclusive beauty marketing predate even the Bud Light boycott, including Mulvaney s 2022partnershipwith Ulta, which drew online anger and boycotts, to which the companyresponded:  We believe that beauty has no boundaries, and we want to create an environment where all expressions of beauty are welcome. Chief CriticsPaul Golding, leader of the far-right British political party Britain First, alsosharedthe ad, stating Maybelline  learned nothing from theBud Light/Target  boycotts, which were launched among conservatives online in response to trans-inclusive marketing campaigns. Maybelline sTwitterandInstagramcomment sections were quickly filled with angry comments, with some declaring they would unfollow or boycott the makeup brand.

Key BackgroundRight-wingbacklashto companies that engage in marketing geared toward the LGBTQ community or focused on diversity, equity and inclusion has proliferated this year, gaining steam after angry conservatives began a boycott of Bud Light in April over its brief partnership with Mulvaney. The boycott led to adip in salesfor the beer brand, and Bud Light producer Anheuser-Busch drew anger from both sides of the political spectrum: the right wing for the marketing campaign, and the left wing for allegedlyfailingto stand behind Mulvaney following criticism. So-called anti-woke backlash intensified during Pride month in June and extended to retailers likeTargetand Kohl s for trans-inclusive and Pride month-themed products, along with professionalsports leagueslike Major League Baseball and Nascar for posting pro-Pride messages and celebrities likeMark CubanandGarth Brooksfor refusing to join in on boycotts.TangentThe right-wing backlash for Maybelline s ad comes on the heels of another viral marketing campaign for the brand.
