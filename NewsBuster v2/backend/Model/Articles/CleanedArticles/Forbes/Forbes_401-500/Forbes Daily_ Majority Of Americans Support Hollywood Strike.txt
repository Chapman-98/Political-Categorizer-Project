Know<figure><figcaption>Many of America s big bosses want their employees back in the office ASAP, arguing that sharing a physical workplace makes them more creative and productive MODERNEWWORLD/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Many CEOs want to get butts back into seats  But is it just  executive nostalgia,  or will it actually make workers more productive and collaborative?The truth is, it s still hard to really know  While fully remote work might be a no-brainer in some jobs and for some employees, it may handicap the work of others Productivity is notoriously tough to measurefor white-collar workers  A lot of existing data hails from self-reported employee surveys or academic research that studies niche worker categories Whilesome data may seem to support complaints executives have that remote work saps productivity, hurts younger workers, lessens creativity or kills corporate culture other research suggests it does the opposite, converting saved commute times into more work hours, retaining workers with child or eldercare needs who require flexibility, and making it easier to build diverse workforces when hiring isn t constrained by geography A recent working paper from Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom pointed to research showing that fully remote workforces appeared to have reduced productivity of around 10% on average, causing a stir  But there s a lot of subtlety to those numbers: The studies reviewed tend to look at lower-paid workforces doing repetitive tasks that can be objectively measured, some reports studied employees during atypical 2020 conditions, and entirely remote companies could save on real estate costs or employee turnover Meanwhile, the research review found that hybrid work s impact on productivity tended to be flat or even slightly positive, even without much in-person time  Among a group of remote call center agents who worked in person just one day a week, for instance, an early study by Bloom saw productivity increase 13%  Government patent officers who could work from anywhere but gathered in-person several times a year, Harvard Business School professor Raj Choudhury found, also saw a boost to productivity rates Whatisclear is thathybrid arrangements seem poised to win out, inexperienced workers are likely more vulnerable to work-from-home s downsides and employees really, really don t want to work full-time in the office WHY IT MATTERS  The debate over remote work shows no signs of letting up, even more than three years after the pandemic ushered office workers home to work remotely,  says Jena McGregor,ForbesSenior Editor, Careers and Leadership Strategy   CEOs are increasingly mandating office returns, whether full-time or a few days a week, while workers especially after years of being productive at home are resisting  To find common ground, leaders and workers need to rely on data rather than opinion  MORE Don t Call It An Office: Cisco Aims To Draw Workers And Customers
