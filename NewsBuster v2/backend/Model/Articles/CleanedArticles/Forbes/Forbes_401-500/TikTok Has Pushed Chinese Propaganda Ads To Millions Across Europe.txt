Another video shows a CGTN host visiting an elementary school in Xinjiang  The school visited by the host was located in the county of Pishan in Xinjiang, where the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has tracked the construction ofsix detention facilities  Ads also tout tours of the region and the culture of its mostly Muslim Uyghur population Other ads appear to be more overtly political in topic and tone: one ad, shown in December, featured an academic criticizing U S  and European resistance to the Chinese international development project the Belt & Road Initiative  Another ad featured a video from a vlogger who has accused Western media of lying about the Chinese government's human rights abuses  According to the ad library, it was running on TikTok as recently as last week AnFAQ pagefor the new ad library says:  TikTok does not show political or election ads on the platform  So you will not be able to find ads of political nature in the Commercial Content Library   TikTok sad policiesprohibit advertising about social issues, elections and politics, though they note that  government entities may be eligible to advertise if working with a TikTok Sales Representative   TikTok spokesperson Jamie Favazza did not reply to questions about whether ads criticizing Western governments  responses to China s Belt & Road initiative, defending China s Covid-19 policies, and promoting tourism in Xinjiang were permitted under TikTok s no-political-ads policy Asked whether the People s Daily, Global Times, and other Chinese state media outlets were working with a sales representative, Favazza said the company did not consider state-controlled media to be government agencies so its rules on government, politician and political parties did not apply  She noted that the ads appeared to be primarily purchased through agencies  The state media agencies did not respond to a request for comment TikTok s ad library does not disclose how much Chinese state media paid to post these ads on its platform  The ads vary in distribution   while the ad library shows that some have been viewed by hundreds of thousands of users, others have been seen by less than a thousand users in Europe TikTok, like Meta and Google, labels accounts run by state media so that users can see a government has produced the content posted by them  However, Favazza said that TikTok is still working to expand its labeling system to cover ads  In response toForbesquestions about ads from the account @GlamourChina ( Travel with panda Huanhuan to see and explore the glamorous side of China! ), the company added a China state-controlled media label to it TikTok is facing numerous government inquiries in Europe and abroad about its ties to the Chinese state  Government offices in the E U , U K , France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, and Norway, among others, havebannedTikTok from government devices over concerns that the app, which is owned by the Chinese tech giant, ByteDance, could be used to exfiltrate sensitive government information to China  In December, the company acknowledged that it had used TikTok tosurveil reportersin the U S and U K , to try to identify their sources  ByteDance staff in China still have access to European TikTok users  data today, though the company hasannounced plansto restrict that access at some point in the future  (Disclosure: In a previous life, Emily Baker-White, an author of this story, held policy positions at Facebook and Spotify )One of regulators  top concerns about TikTok is a fear that it could be used by the Chinese government to warp civic discourse in democratic nations  Chinese state media publishers have alongÂ historyof using social media advertising to push pro-China narratives in the west, and both the Meta and Google ad libraries show that both platformscontinueto promote pro-Chinanarrativesthrough advertising  In 2021, Meta employeesraised concernsabout Chinese state media ads on Facebook portraying happy Muslims in Xinjiang, but the company decided that the ads did not violate company policy  Unlike Meta and Google, however, TikTok has decided to forbid advertising about politics, social issues, or elections on its platform Both Meta and Google label content posted by state media outlets, and inJanuary, TikTok announced that it would join them in doing so  (Twitterformerlylabeled posts by state media outlets, but discontinued the labels under Elon Musk ) Still, the rollout of TikTok s policy was rocky   it failed to label the account @NewsTokss, which is operated by the Washington D C -based outpost of China Central Television, until it wasflaggedbyForbes  Forbes has previously reported that China Central Television accounts pushed videos that attacked specific U S  politicians and issues prior to themidterm elections When TikTok announced its ad library, some transparency advocates cast the announcement as evidence of regulation at work  Under the European Union s Digital Services Act (DSA), large platforms like TikTok will now berequiredto maintain searchable databases of ads  TikTok s announcement said the company intends to expand the library beyond Europe, but did not offer specifics about when, and for which countries, it plans to do so MORE FROM FORBES
