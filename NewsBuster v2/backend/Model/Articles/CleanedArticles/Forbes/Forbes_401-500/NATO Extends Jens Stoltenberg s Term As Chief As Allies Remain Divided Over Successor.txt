The  transatlantic bond  between Europe and North America has safeguarded freedom and security for nearly 75 years, Stoltenberg said, adding that  in a more dangerous world, our Alliance is more important than ever. Key BackgroundThe fourth extension of Stoltenberg s term can be viewed as both commentary on NATO s politically sensitive position and the intractable divisions between members over who should replace him. All members of the alliance must endorse its leader and Stoltenberg, a veteran in European politics, enjoys strong support as a cool and level headed leader. His first mandate wasextendedowing to strong support from key powers like Washington, London, Berlin and Paris and it wasextendedagain in 2019 and2022 when he already had a job lined up at Norway s central bank to preserve stability in light of Russia s increasing assertiveness and, subsequently, its invasion of Ukraine. Some members, including the U.S., reportedly lobbied to have Stoltenberg stay on as efforts to find a successor floundered. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace were reportedly among leading contenders for the post Frederiksen would have been the first woman to head the alliance but were seemingly unable to secure the necessary backing.What To Watch ForThe decision comes ahead of the annual NATO summit in Vilnius next week and at a critical time for the alliance and European security. Ukraine will top the agenda and be closely watched around the world, particularly how the alliance and its members will continue to support it in its war with Russia and outlining the nature of its relationship with the alliance going forward, notably how and when it might join. Another closely watched matter will be how the alliance approaches Moscow given growing domestic instabilities in Russia and the potential threats to Vladimir Putin s rule. The threat posed by China is also likely to be a prominent point of discussion during the meeting, and there will likely be significant diplomatic pressure put on Hungary and Turkey to finally approve Sweden s accession having greenlit Finland s months ago.Further ReadingNATO Chief Stoltenberg Says Russia s War In Ukraine Could Last Years(Forbes)
