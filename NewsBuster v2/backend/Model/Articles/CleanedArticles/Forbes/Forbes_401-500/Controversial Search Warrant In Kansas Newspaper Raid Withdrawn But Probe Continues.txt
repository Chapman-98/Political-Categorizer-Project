Meyer, who told theAssociated Presshe believes the newspaper's coverage of local politics and an ongoing investigation into Marion County Police Chief Gideon Cody s record led to the raid, also blames the stress of the search for the Saturday death of his mother, 98-year-old Joan Meyer, who was a co-owner of the paper.Kansas state authoritiesconfirmedto AP that they are involved in a criminal probe of theMarion County Recordover its information gathering tactics, and Rhodes has accused the local police chief of incorrectly applying privacy laws to news reporters.The Kansas Bureau of Investigation on Wednesday toldForbesthe probe into theRecordremains open, but will be completed "without review or examination of any of the evidence seized"<figure><figcaption>A tribute to the late Marion County Record co-owner Joan Meyer sits outside the newspaper's office, Monday, Aug. 14, 2023, in Marion, Kan.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The Marion County Record was accused of violating her privacy when they obtained copies of her driving record, but Meyer said the paper was sent information about her 2008 drunken driving conviction from a source and all it did was verify the information using public records, Rhodes told the. The paper eventually decided not to run a story on the conviction, perthe AP, but did mention it in an article after she spoke publicly against the newspaper's investigation at a city council meeting. Newell told the AP she is considering a lawsuit against the newspaper. The raid of the newspaper rare in the United States has drawn the ire of First Amendment advocates, and the Society of Professional Journalistspledgedto pay $20,000 in legal fees for theRecord.TangentIn an interview withThe Handbasket, a news blog run by MSNBC columnist Marisa Kabas, Meyer said his newspaper has been actively investigating Cody after several tips he'd moved to Marion County following alleged sexual misconduct in his previous role as a Kansas City police captain. Meyer said the paper received "an outpouring of calls" over several months about the allegations but had not run a story because it couldn't get any sources to go on the record. The allegations and the identities of the tipsters were on the computers seized by Cody's department, Meyer said. Before the search warrant was withdrawn, Rhodessent a letterto Cody warning against his accessing any files on any seized equipment and said doing so would "willfully violate" the privilege of journalists.<figure><figcaption>Eric Meyer, the editor and publisher of the Marion County Record, answers questions about a raid by local police and sheriff's deputies on his newspaper's newsroom and his home, Sunday, Aug. 13, 2023, in Marion, Kan.Associated Press</figcaption></figure>ContraSome in the small town of Marion, Kansas, say they support the investigation into the newspaper, and one resident told the Associated Press this isn't the first time theRecord has gone out of its way to paint a negative picture of local community members.
