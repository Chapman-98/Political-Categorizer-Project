<figure><figcaption>ILLUSTRATION BY ANGELICA ALZONA FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Under a draft agreement between ByteDance and the Biden administration, Oracle would be TikTok s partner and a government proctor But the relationship between ByteDance and Oracle has become deeply untrusting and adversarial, according to five sources  One source with knowledge of the companies  actions characterized Oracle s stance toward ByteDance as a  counterintelligence operation,  rather than a normal customer relationship  Meanwhile, some ByteDance employees wonder if Oracle just wants to run up their bill The TikTok contract, known internally at Oracle as Project Telesis, has madeByteDance one of Oracle s most lucrative customers  Details from aSummer 2022 draft of the agreement between ByteDance and the Biden Administration, reviewed byForbesand reported here for the first time, show that if the parties were able to reach an agreement, TikTok s relationship with Oracle would go beyond that of a typical service provider  The draft agreement, as it was being negotiated at the time, appeared to give Oracle the power to determine whether TikTok s source code matched ByteDance s representations to the U S  government and, if it found they didn t to suspend TikTok s functionality in the United States,withholding the app from its 150 million U S  users The draft agreement would also have given the government the right to require ByteDance totemporarily stop TikTok from functioning in the U S in certain circumstances including if Oracle claimed that TikTok and ByteDance had not provided the necessary funds for it to carry out its responsibilities TikTok spokesperson Alex Haurek did not comment on the relationship between TikTok and Oracle or the draft agreement, nor did he answer a detailed list of questions, instead providing a statement  Oracle and the U S  government declined to comment WHY IT MATTERS  With both the U S  Government and everyday users, TikTok has touted its partnership with Oracle as a reason it should be trusted in the United States,  saysForbesreporter Emily Baker-White   But that relationship once the centerpiece of a national security negotiation that has fallen out of favor with the U S  government is far rockier than either company has acknowledged  MOREA Draft Of TikTok s Plan To Avoid A Ban Gives The U S  Government
