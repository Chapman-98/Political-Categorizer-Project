ToplineHouse Republicans started an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden this week, launching what could be the third effort to impeach a president in just four years leaving experts surveyed byForbes split on whether tit-for-tat impeachments will become commonplace, as party divides deepen and a once-rarely used process becomes a partisan tool <figure><figcaption>Speaker of the House

Tuesday, which isn t automatically a precursor to impeachment but could set the stage for one after Trump was impeached in 2019 for allegedly pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and other Democrats, and again in 2021 after the January 6 Capitol riots Larry Sabato, founder and director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, toldForbesthe extreme political polarization of today means "we can expect to see impeachment used more frequently especially because a conviction won t happen " Sabato said he doesn't envision either party having the necessary two-thirds vote of the Senate to convict and eject a sitting president anytime soon, and warned using impeachment for "partisan amusement" has weakened the U S  presidency Jeffrey Berry, a professor emeritus of political science at Tufts University, said there is a  good chance  we will see impeachment proceedings again down the line, contributing to what he called an  increasingly unstable democracy  he said moving toward impeaching Biden in retaliation for Trump s impeachments is a reflection of  a larger cultural, antagonistic divide  that is showing no signs of receding Laura Blessing a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute said the impeachment attempt is indicative of a weak Speaker of the House who is trying to keep promises to the most extreme members of his party, and noted increased use of what is meant to be a  sad and serious task  as a  political exercise  could become commonplace if party leaders continue to benefit from division Frank Luntz, a conservative pollster and Trump critic who offered advice to GOP candidates in the leadup to Democratic President Bill Clinton s impeachment, called impeachment the  latest and ugliest tool in the political shed  and said the once-rare process now feels like it will be used  once every other president  Frank Bowman, author of the book High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump,said he thinks the political system is at  risk  of seeing an increasing number of impeachment attempts:  If we re stumbling into an era where impeachment efforts become the norm, it will be simply because it is a Republican phenomenon,  he said, but "that s not to say that if the shoe gets on the other foot, Democrats are so inherently virtuous that they won t pursue it themselves "<figure><figcaption>U S  President Joe Biden listens to shouted questions regarding impeachment during a meeting of his Cancer Cabinet at the White House on September 13, 2023 in

threat for actual removal is to repair the political system  Key BackgroundThe Constitution says officials can be impeached for  Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors   Even the founding fathers differed on the appropriate process and reasons for removing a dangerous executive power,historians say, but they ultimately agreed that a president should be impeachable for constitutional abuses and to preserve the integrity of the government and the law  Historically, the tool has been rarely used and only three presidents have been impeached in American history: Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998 and Donald Trump twice  Richard Nixon in 1974 and John Tyler in 1842 were both the subjects of impeachment proceedings, but Nixon resigned before a House vote and Tyler's impeachment resolution did not pass  In the modern-day impeachments of Trump and Clinton, the votes to impeach were largely partisan  Only five Democrats in the House voted to impeach Clinton on two charges related to the Monica Lewinsky affair, and all but a dozen Republicans fell in line 5 voted against the perjury charge and 12 against obstruction of justice  Only three Democrats broke rank and voted against the impeachment of Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in 2019, and not a single House Republican voted for either article, though Sen  Mitt Romney (R-Utah) voted to convict Trump on one count  In 2021, every Democrat and 10 Republicans voted to impeach, and seven Senate Republicans voted with 50 Democrats to convict Trump <figure><figcaption>A woman

Republicans  attempt to equate the crimes committed by Trump to any actions by Biden  is a distortion of what s happening here   Rosenberg argued the lack of evidence in Biden s impeachment inquiry he called the effort  frivolous  could actually reduce the use of presidential eviction as a political tool   I ve been surprised by how aggressive the statements by Republican senators against this attempt have been,  he said   Some have publicly noted how ridiculous this is, and there is a chance this actually raises the bar for what can be considered impeachable in the future  TangentSabato called the Biden probe retaliation following the impeachments of Trump, something others have said is largely unprecedented  Rosenberg said there was little partisan blowback when President Bill Clinton was impeached more than 20 years ago, nor in 1974 when Congress was close to impeaching Nixon  Bowman said it is possible the Clinton impeachment had  echos of retaliation  from the Nixon outster  He was the embodiment of the young, long-haired, dope-smoking image conservatives despised during the Nixon era,  he said but that any connection between the two was  certainly faint   Similarly, Rosenberg said:  There was no retribution to (George W  Bush) because of Clinton s impeachment  <figure><figcaption>US President Bill Clinton, center, addresses the nation 19 December from

instructed the House Judiciary, Oversight and Ways and Means committees to open a formal impeachment inquiry into Biden  Among the accusations brought by Republicans are claims the president benefitted from his son Hunter Biden s foreign business interests and had phone calls and dinners with Hunter s business partners, and an unconfirmed allegation that a Ukrainian energy CEO paid the Biden family $10 million to help remove a Ukrainian corruption prosecutor  The bribery claim has not been proven, and Biden has long denied any involvement in his son s business dealings  Evidence has not emerged that Biden broke the law or financially benefited from his son s activity  McCarthy did not explicitly call for Biden to be impeached, but said the allegations  warrant further investigation   Members of the far right have threatened to call for McCarthy s removal if he doesn't back a Biden impeachment inquiry  Meanwhile, some House Republicans have said they are against impeaching Biden, calling the demands for an inquiry "absurd" (Rep  Ken Buck of Colorado) andcalling for"more concrete evidence" (Rep  Don Bacon of Nebraska) What To Watch ForThe next step in the process would be for McCarthy to call for a vote to formalize the inquiry, and the Judiciary Committee would then need to draft articles of impeachment  The House would have to approve them with a majority vote, which would formally impeach the president  The Senate would then need a two-thirds vote to remove Biden, which is unlikely in the Democratic-controlled chamber What We Don t KnowHow impeachment will impact Republicans' political fortunes  Rosenberg called the move a strategic  disaster  for the Republican party, adding it  pushes them further and further away from the issues that matter to voters   Berry, however, said those pushing for Biden s removal are largely representing their hard-right constituents, who want to hear their legislators talk about impeachment on the campaign trail  He said the inquiry will be a boon for conservatives in conservative districts, but will likely not appeal to the wider conservative base, nor will it help Republicans win
