prosecutors and ruled that former President Donald Trump was personally liable for fraud  The piles of documents prosecutors have submitted helped Judge Arthur Engoron come to that conclusion,

Figma<figure><figcaption>Framer cofounders Koen Bok and Jorn van Dijk FRAMER</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE In April 2021, Jorn van Dijk and Koen Bok, the cofounders of the design software startup Framer,were facing some tough news Their company s prototyping tool for detailed app and website mockups had been a hit among a small group of designers, but after six years, revenues had slumped from their peak of $4 million in late 2019  So the two former Facebook designers decided to evolve their software to actually build the websites it mocks up The pivot appears to be paying off so far  In just under 18 months since the launch of this new product, the Amsterdam-based startup has grown revenues fourfold to over $10 million  Now, after raising a $27 million Series C round (the valuation was not disclosed), Framer is attracting attention from Silicon Valley investors, and rivals like Figma, that are watching its no-code publishing tools and growth closely,Forbeshas learned Equipped with fresh cash, Bok and van Dijkhave their eyes set on international expansion  They plan to build widgets to support larger customers and add AI-powered website translations Framer has a rough road ahead as itgoes head to head with some established American rivals  Webflow scored its own Series C round in March 2022 but with revenues of $100 million and a $4 billion valuation  Then there s Adobe, which forecasted revenues of $400 million in 2022 for Figma when it announced plans for a $20 billion takeover of the collaborative design startup in September last year Bok and van Dijk don t seem daunted to challenge two well-funded rivals at the same time  Putting together the designing and building of websites will change how they are built,  says van Dijk WHY IT MATTERS Building websites quickly and cheaply has been a winning formula for consumer-facing startups  Nasdaq-listed Wix, SquareSpace, and Wordpress s owner Automattic, which was valued at over $7 5 billion in a 2021 share buyback  But van Dijk and Bok realized that businesses with more complex needs often need to hire a team to address them or turn to rival website builder startup Webflow  We discovered a really big juicy problem because traditional web design happens in one tool like Figma, then actual building is done elsewhere,  says Bok   The fact that they are separate makes for a very inefficient
