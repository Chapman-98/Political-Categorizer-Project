The longshot contender started his career in a double-wide trailer and ended up in the Arkansas governor s mansion  Now, he s trying to beat out a crowd of far richer politicos to reach the White House  By Kyle Mullins, Forbes StaffIna presidential race loaded with multimillionaires as well as the world s most famous billionaire former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson stands out as a candidate of relatively modest means, worth an estimated $1 5 million Like most Americans his age, the majority of Hutchinson s wealth is tied up in his home, which he bought 13 years ago for $514,000  Today it s worth roughly $1 2 million, and he has an estimated $300,000 left on the mortgage  He also has valuable pensions from the federal government and State of Arkansas, estimated to be worth nearly $300,000  Hutchinson spent some time in the private sector, dabbling in blank-check companies before the Great Recession, but he never struck it rich  Today his investment portfolio consists of a random assortment of holdings, including stock in a coffee business, shares of GE Healthcare and a position in the cruise company Norwegian, according to a financial disclosure report he filed a month ago It all adds up to a decent amount of money, especially considering where Hutchinson started  Born in Bentonville, Arkansas, he grew up as a farm boy in a nearby town named Gravette, cleaning chicken coops and building fences for his father  Hutchinson headed to South Carolina for college, where he attended a Christian school named Bob Jones University before returning home for law school at the University of Arkansas Although his life took him many places, he never strayed too far from Bentonville, his hometown  His first law office sat in the town square, near the local courthouse, where he tried some of his first cases  At the end of the day, he returned home to a double-wide trailer on the west end of town, where he lived with his wife Susan ASA S ASSETSTwo pensions and a million-dollar home add up to a comfortable if not extravagant life for the former governor Hutchinson quickly made a name for himself, though, and at age 31, Ronald Reagan appointed him to serve as the U S  attorney for the western district of Arkansas, making him the youngest U S  attorney in the country  In 1985, he donned a bulletproof vest and helped negotiate the end of a hostage standoff with white supremacists in the Ozarks that made national headlines Seeking higher office, Hutchinson ran for the U S  Senate, launching his campaign from the steps of the Bentonville courthouse where he tried his early cases  He lost that election, along with a follow-on one for attorney general of the state  In 1996, however, Hutchinson s brother Tim vacated his seat in the U S  House of Representatives  Asa ran to replace him and won  Soon, he was thrust into the national spotlight again: In 1998, the House impeached another Arkansas politician, Bill Clinton, and Hutchinson served as one of the managers in the trial before the U S  Senate <figure><figcaption>Hutchinson campaigned with his former boss, then-President George W  Bush, in a losing bid for the Arkansas governorship in

as administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, then undersecretary of homeland security  His decade in the federal government provided Hutchinson with a pension thatForbes estimates is worth about $100,000 today More lucrative, however, was Hutchinson s time out of government  He left the Bush administration in 2005 and, while running an ultimately unsuccessful campaign for governor in 2006, earned some money via the revolving door that has provided windfalls for so many high-ranking officials in Washington  He started his own homeland security consulting firm, became a partner at D C -based law firm Venable LLP and got involved in some special purpose acquisitions companies and corporate boards  One SPAC awarded him 200,000 shares and a  special advisor  position nine days after he left DHS  Another company, named Saflink, had won a border security contract from DHS that Hutchinson was involved with while there  Not all these ventures were successful Saflink went belly-up in 2009, for example, and another SPAC, which he left when it merged with a tourism company in 2009, filed for bankruptcy in 2010  But Hutchinson made out okay in certain cases, earning more than $200,000 in cash from one board position, in addition to some shares that dropped off a cliff during the financial crisis He eventually headed back to the Ozarks, cofounded a local law firm with his son and, in 2010, purchased a home near the posh Pinnacle Country Club  That house remains Hutchinson s largest asset, worth an estimated $1 2 million today In 2015, Hutchinson returned to politics again, vying for the governor s mansion a second time  He won, setting himself up to receive about $150,000 a year as well as a state pension worth an estimated $179,000 Thanks to his two pensions, Hutchinson lives comfortably today, though his harder early days are never far from his mind  When Hutchinson launched his campaign for president in April, he did so from where else? the steps of the Bentonville courthouse where he started his career as a humble hometown lawyer, and later launched his failed bid for the U S  Senate  This is a day,  he said as he took the podium, with a line of hometown cheerleaders behind him,  in which our nation s future and my personal story comes together  MORE FROM FORBES
