Chinese companies learned the very same lesson,  Stein said  And so Chinese companies are now insisting that their suppliers be close to them,  a demand that is requiring investment Joint ventures are also not what they once were   Many companies point out that when they first came to China, they were forced to take a venture partner and that joint venture partner was essentially a millstone  It held them back  It made it difficult for them to operate and raised costs  But often now that's not the case,  Stein said  Now when we see new investments coming in, foreign investors are often looking for a joint venture partner   a Chinese joint venture partner   because in many cases, they've got capabilities that the foreign company doesn't have on its own  Sometimes that's nimbleness in the digital space or more effective marketing  Sometimes it's even technology,  he noted   Sometimes it's government relations  Another driver of American investment is a wish to keep on top of competition  Many executives  worry about the companies that no one's ever heard of and that are spending days and nights thinking about how to disrupt their business, and are looking for ways to beat them on cost or beat them on speed to market,  Stein said Prominent U S  business leaders to visit China of late include Tesla s Elon Musk, JPMorgan s Jamie Dimon and Starbucks  Laxman Narasimhan  Chinese Ambassador to the U S  Xie Feng noted Tesla s and Starbucks expansion in the country during a presentation at Tuesday s forum  (See related posthere ) U S  Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo visited the country last week in part to help give a boost to American businesses there Though investment plusses are still present, China is no doubt more complicated than it used to be and harder to succeed in, Stein also said <figure><figcaption>Participants at the U S -China Business Forum exchanged on current business trends Nathan Covey</figcaption></figure>In the past for instance, foreign investors worried about competition from very large, well-funded state-owned businesses   While that's still a concern, what's an even bigger concern  is that Chinese companies have grown up and  become much more effective at trying to fight for market share  Earlier improvements in areas such as intellectual property, transparency, predictability of regulation, and an assurance that the legal administrative justice system is going to be balanced for both local and foreign players have reversed, he noted  For years, it was getting better a little bit year after year, maybe just 2 or 3%, but after four or five years, that turned into some big significant gains,  Stein said   But what we've seen over the last couple of years is, in fact, that has started to trend the other way and it's becoming more difficult in all of those areas,  he said  There's a perception that all of those are now working more against U S  business than for U S  business or even foreign business,  Stein said   And then, on top of this, complex data regulations  are adding to challenges   China is not an easy place to do business  And so it's not every company that's able to thrive in this environment  And so what I would encourage everyone to do is come and see how China has changed over the time since you've been here, because it's changed a lot  The attitudes, the way the government operates, how foreign businesses are viewed, the regulatory environment  everything is different,  compared to only a few years ago, Stein said   And if you're not here and you haven't been here, it's just hard to know  <figure><figcaption>Chinese Ambassador Xie Feng addressed this year's U S -China Business Forum Chinese Embassy in the U S </figcaption></figure>Other event speakers included George Wang, vice chairman of Zhonglu Group;
