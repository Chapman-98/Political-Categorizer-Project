Chemicals <figure><figcaption>Mark Newman, CEO of chemical maker ChemoursCHRISTOPHER GOODNEY/BLOOMBERG</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Wilmington, Delaware-based Chemours is the only U S  manufacturer of a fluoropolymer known as PFA, a type ofcontroversial  forever chemical  and an essential tool in the production of semiconductors  For Chemours, advanced materials including fluoropolymers represent roughly one-quarter of its total $6 3 billion (latest 12-months revenue) business  On its website, Chemours says flat-out that  without PFA, domestic semiconductor manufacturing would not be possible  Last year, President Biden signed into law the CHIPS Act, whichprovides $52 billion in funding to spur domestic semiconductor manufacturingwith a goal of improving national security by decreasing reliance on nations like China for critical technology  Chips are essential not just for our phones and computers, but also for electric vehicles, medical devices and fighter jets But our insatiable desire for more electronic devices and American policymakers  push for more domestic manufacturing of semiconductors relies on the industry s access to large amounts of controversial  forever chemicals  Forever chemicals, or PFAS, comprise thousands of synthetic chemicals  They re long-lasting and resistant to heat, corrosion and moisture, making them popular for a variety of products like nonstick pans, stain-resistant upholstery, firefighting foam and semiconductor production  Studies, however, have linked PFAS to a variety of diseases,including cancers and reduced immune system response, as well as to contaminated groundwater, air and soil that can lead to a host of health problems The semiconductor industry has pushed back against regulations here and in Europe, where regulators had proposed a ban on PFAS In this landscape, Mark Newman, CEO of Chemours and one of the country s top Black executives, is doubling down  In a wide-ranging interview withForbes during a trip to New York for Climate Week, Newman said that thecompany with a $4 billion market cap was expanding production of fluoropolymers, driven by the critical need for the chemicals in semiconductors and electric vehicles  He said such production could be done safely with investments that his company is already making WHY IT MATTERS  Reshoring semiconductor manufacturing is important for national security and brings good-paying jobs, but there are drawbacks,  saysForbesexecutive editor Bob Ivry   Forever chemicals are essential to chip production and they can be problematic Studies have linked them to disease and environmental pollution  It s up to Chemours, the only American maker of PFA, to find a way to mitigate the ill effects without slowing down the manufacturing process  MOREYour
