ToplineRetired NFL offensive lineman Michael Oher, whose childhood inspired the 2009 filmThe Blind Side, filed a petition in a Tennessee state court Monday alleging Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy never adopted him as the film portrays and accusing the family of tricking him into signing a conservatorship agreement, which allowed them to make millions of dollars on his story without paying him anything.<figure><figcaption>Michael Oher is pictured during the 2009 NFL draft with members of the Tuohy family at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

Chief CriticThe Tuohys have not responded to Forbes  request for comment, but Sean Tuohy toldthe Daily Memphianthat the family was  devastated  when they heard about the petition. He claimed the family never made any money off the movie and that the conservatorship was a way of appeasing concerns from the NCAA about improper recruiting when Oher was considering playing at Ole Miss, a university where Tuohy was a former basketball player and a booster. He did acknowledge that each family member earned $14,000 from the book the movie was based on, but said that Oher also received that. He said the family would  of course  agree to end the conservatorship.  No question, the allegations are insulting,  he told theDaily Memphian,  but, look, it s a crazy world. Key BackgroundThe Blind Side, based of a book of the same title,tells the supposedly true story of Oher, a poor child in the Tennessee foster case system, defying the odds to play football on a full-ride scholarship in college and then in the NFL, with the help of the generous Tuohy family, who brought Oher into their home, adopted the teenager and helped him hone his football skills on the varsity team at a Memphis-area Christian high school. The film, which starred Sandra Bullock, who won an Oscar for best actress, while the movie earned $309 million at the box office. Monday s petition casts doubt on the accuracy of the film, arguing that a main plot point is a  lie.  Oher was a star lineman at Ole Miss before the Baltimore Ravens selected him in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He spent eight seasons in the NFL between the Ravens, Tennessee Titans and Carolina Panthers, winning a Super Bowl in 2013.TangentOver the years, Oher has been publicly critical of the film, saying it unfairly depicts him as unintelligent. "People look at me, and they take things away from me because of a movie," Ohertold ESPNin 2015. "They don't really see the skills and the kind of player I am." Last week, he released a book,When Your Back's Against the Wall: Fame, Football, and Lessons Learned Through a Lifetime of Adversity, in which he wrote: "There has been so much created fromThe Blind Sidethat I am grateful for, which is why you might find it as a shock that the experience surrounding the story has also been a large source of some of my deepest hurt and pain over the past 14 years   Beyond the details of the deal, the politics, and the money behind the book and movie, it was the principle of the choices some people made that cut me the deepest," according toESPN.What To Watch ForHow this case proceeds. The petition asks the court to end the conservatorship, bar the Tuohys from using Oher s name, image and likeness and require the Tuohys to provide Oher his fair share of the earnings made off his story plus interest and punitive damages.Further Reading'Blind Side' subject Oher alleges Tuohys made millions off lie(ESPN)Sean Tuohy responds to  Blind Side  allegations:  We are going to keep loving Michael (Oher) (The Daily Memphian)
