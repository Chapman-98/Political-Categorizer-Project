someone s voice  The startup, valued at about $100 million, is one of the hottest voice AI companies right now, butit s also at the center of generative AI s impact on voice actors  Interviews with 10 voice actors revealed an already precarious industry on the brink of widespread change as employers begin to experiment with these text-to-speech tools Like striking film actors, who are sounding the alarm about the coming of AI and how it could affect their jobs,voice actors are on the front lines of technological change But unlike other creative fields, where authors and artists are banding together in class-action lawsuits to push back against their copyrighted work being used to train AI models, voice actors are uniquely vulnerable  Even though voices are inherently distinguishable, they cannot be patented and aren t protected under copyright law That s why the newly formed National Association of Voice Actors (NAVA) union, and the actors union SAG-AFTRA, are working to strike verbiage from contracts that allows employers to use an actor s voice to create a  digital double,  or  synthesize  their voice through machine learning After ElevenLabs rolled out the beta version of
