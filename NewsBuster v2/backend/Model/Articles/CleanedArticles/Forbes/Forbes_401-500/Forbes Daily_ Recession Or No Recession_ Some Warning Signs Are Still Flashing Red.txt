DAILY COVER STORYInside Chipper Cash s Grueling Battle To Survive The Fintech Winter<figure><figcaption>Chipper Cash's cofounders, president Maijid Moujaled (left) and CEO Ham SerunjogiETHAN PINES FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled cofounded Chipper Cash in 2018 to develop theVenmo for Africa. They eventually raised $300 million in funding from investors including FTX, Ribbit Capital and Bezos Expeditions. The company was valued at $2.2 billion in 2021.The layoffs started slowly. In July 2022, four of the company s recruiters were dismissed. Seven quality assurance engineers came next, two months later, then in early December, about 50 employees, or slightly above 10% of the staff, received emails in their personal accounts telling them they no longer had jobs.

And that's an expensive endeavor,  he admits. Then as interest rates rose and the stock market sank, investors put away their checkbooks.Now, Chipper is trying to dramatically cut costs and change its strategy while preventing employees from thinking they re on a sinking ship. As he tries to turn the company around, Serunjogi faces the tough task of still striving for rapid growth and getting close to profitability on a much tighter budget.WHY IT MATTERS Chipper s predicament is emblematic of the challenges many fintech startups face today.In 2020 and 2021, as Covid pushed more transactions online and consumers flocked to fintech apps, startups and their backers acted like the fast growth and good times would continue for years.FACTS AND COMMENTSCancer rates in Americans under 50are rising slightly,especially among women, Asian and Pacific Islander populations.
