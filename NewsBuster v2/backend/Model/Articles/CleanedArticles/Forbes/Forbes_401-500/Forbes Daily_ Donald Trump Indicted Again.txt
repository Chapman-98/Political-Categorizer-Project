That bill, paid over the past eight years, has helped Costco become theonly retailer to own a chicken slaughterhouse. We ve trussed, we ve marinated it, we ve done all that,  says Walt Shafer, chief operating officer of Costco subsidiary Lincoln Premium Processing, who after 45 years in the chicken industry was tasked with building the plant and its grower network from scratch.  Not only is it a super buy for the consumer, it s become the center of the store, literally, anda centerpiece for Costco. It s why we re here. That s why we exist.

Through all the industry turmoil, Costco is counting on the sweet and salty perfume of the packaged birds to remain a popular draw.MOREJohn R.
