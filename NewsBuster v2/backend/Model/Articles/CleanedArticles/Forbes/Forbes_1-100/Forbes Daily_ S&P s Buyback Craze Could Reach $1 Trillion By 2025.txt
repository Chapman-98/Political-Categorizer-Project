DAILY COVER STORYBest Places To Retire In 2024: Las Cruces And Other Unexpected Hot Spots<figure><figcaption>Las Cruces, New MexicoSWCARGILL/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINEForbescompared more than 800 locales in America on everything from housing costs and taxes to healthcare, air quality, crime, as well as climate change and natural hazard risk to come up with ourlist of the 25 Best Places to Retire In 2024.Housing costs are a prime consideration, since the median price of single-family homes nationwide has risen to $394,000, up 47% since the start of 2020, according to the National Association of Realtors. That, and our continuing screens for such factors as natural hazard risks, primary care doctor availability and crime, means that our list includes some lesser known but very inviting places.For example, Las Cruces, New Mexico, a town of 116,000 on our list for the first time in a decade, has a median home price of just $284,000. That s 28% below the national median, and 51% below the median of $579,000 in arts mecca Santa Fe, New Mexico, 285 miles to the north.Notably, sunny Pensacola, a city of 53,000 with a median home price of just $262,000, is our only pick in retirement-magnet Florida. Why? We ruled out other Sunshine State locales for having too high hurricane risks or home prices. Reflecting recent storm destruction and skyrocketing property insurance premiums, some retirement transplants to Florida are now reportedly packing up and relocating again.Besides costs and taxes, our selection process takes into account such metrics as prospects for the local economy, air quality, serious crime and the availability of primary care doctors, as well as whether a place encourages an active lifestyle by making biking or walking convenient.More than a third of our picks are college towns, which tend to punch above their size in amenities, including lifelong learning, culture and dining all at an affordable cost.WHY IT MATTERS This year, anestimated 4.1 million Baby Boomers in the U.S. will turn 65,the traditional retirement age, although most folks retire earlier or later. About one-tenth of new retirees relocate to another state for any number of reasons climate, proximity to family, a better place to feed their passion for the arts or sailing or golf. But a major impetus for long-distance moves is economics, as manifested by the cost of housing and living as well as state taxes.MORE 25 Best Places To Enjoy Your Retirement In 2023: Traverse City And Other Top SpotsFACTS + COMMENTSThe share ofmortgaged residential homes in the U.S. considered  seriously underwater saw a slight increase last quarter, according to new data Thursday.
