Advertisers<figure><figcaption>ILLUSTRATION BY ANGELICA ALZONA FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINEIt s not justTikTok usersandTikTok creatorswhose sensitive data has been mishandled by TikTok and its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance it s TikTok advertisers, too, aForbesinvestigation has found For years, data about TikTok s prized advertisers which range from small mom-and-pop businesses to giant multinationals was widely available to staff at both TikTok and ByteDance, according to internal documents, communications, videos and screenshots obtained byForbes, as well as multiple sources across TikTok  That left sensitive and competitive information from the likes of Amazon, Disney and theNew York Times vulnerable to being accessed or misused by employees most anywhere, including in China, a fear now at the center of federal legislation threatening to ban TikTok in the United States Some of the most-used programs inside TikTok s advertising arm were built by ByteDance, according to the internal materials and five people who worked at the company in 2023 and 2024  As a result, some said, ByteDance workers had broad access not only to basics like advertisers  emails, but also to financial agreements and tax information; data from  pixels  placed on advertisers  websites to glean intel on customers; delicate details on how companies are targeting those customers; and creative assets that could be valuable for their competitors Sources in TikTok s advertising division between 2021 and 2024 described it as an intensely chaotic environment where those in sales roles underpaid and under the gun to meet ever-more aggressive revenue goals set by the company had to operate under a money-at-all-costs mentality that may have forced some to adopt questionable sales tactics One recent sales employee toldForbesthey had, at their managers  urging, used advertisers  information to push their rivals to spend more on TikTok  That included sending their clients creative assets from competitors, as well as information about what those competitors were spending and how they were targeting their ads, the source said, to push clients to match or exceed their rivals  ad spend on the platform WHY IT MATTERS  Our investigation into concerns about how TikTok has handled sensitive business information from its advertisers comes against thebackdrop of record scrutiny in Washington over TikTok s ownershipby a Chinese company,  saysForbessenior writer Alexandra S  Levine   TikTok s handling of Americans' personal data has already prompted investigations by the FBI, DOJ and FTC and culminated in legislation from Congress (supported by the White House) that threatens to ban TikTok nationwide  Our new findings about ByteDance's far-reaching access to data about U S  advertisers big and small may well add fuel to that fire  MOREThe U S  Takes A Major Step Toward Banning TikTokFACTS AND COMMENTSThe release of
