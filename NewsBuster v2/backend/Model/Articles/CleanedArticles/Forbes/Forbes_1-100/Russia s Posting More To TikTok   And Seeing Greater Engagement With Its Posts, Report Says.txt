ToplineAs U.S. lawmakers pressure Chinese-affiliated social media platform TikTok to find an American owner amid concern it could become a hub for Chinese propaganda, anew reportfrom the Brookings Institution suggests Russia may be increasingly seeking to use the platform to push state-sponsored messaging.<figure><figcaption>FILE - The TikTok logo is displayed on a mobile phone in front of a computer screen, Oct. 14, 2022, in Boston. TikTok is gearing up for a legal fight against a U.S. law that would force the social media platform to break ties with its China-based parent company or face a ban. A battle in the courts will almost certainly be backed by Chinese authorities as the bitter U.S.-China rivalry threatens the future of a wildly popular way for young Americans to connect online.

The company argues it has a  strong record of removing covert influence operations and eliminating their accounts  and has removed 13 networks operating from Russia.What To Watch ForThe trends show a  clear shift  in Russia s overt strategies for pushing its preferred messages into the public sphere, recognizing TikTok as a potential driver for engagement. This may complement similar shifts in its  covert  information operations tosecretly amplify its preferred messaging, the report notes.Key BackgroundThe report comes as other observers have noted an uptick in Russian efforts to influence U.S. politics ahead of the 2024 election. A recent report from theMicrosoft Threat Analysis Center, for instance, found that Russian influence operations have shown new signs of activity in recent months, suggesting a ramp up to the heart of election season. But the Brookings Institution s study on TikTok comes as U.S. lawmakers have passedlegislationthreatening to ban TikTok if its parent company, ByteDance, can t find a U.S.-based buyer to sell it to. The law was prompted by long standing concerns about Chinese links to ByteDance, the potential misuse of U.S. user data and concern it could become a platform of Chinese propaganda.Crucial Quote Avoiding the platform entirely or exclusively focusing on the potential for Beijing-approved messaging to reach audiences distracts from the reality that TikTok is a contested information space, much like any other social media platform,  report author Valerie Wirtschafter wrote. She argued that overlooking Russia s increased presence on the platform  allows these narratives to circulate widely and without pushback. Further Reading
