PROVISIONS</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE More than 13 years after CEO Eugene Kang purchased Country Archer for $500,000, the brand has become the fifth-largest jerky company in America It s the sole better-for-you option made with grass-fed meat, little sugar and no antibiotics among historic brands such as Jack Links and Slim Jim With more than $100 million in annual revenue, Country Archer is now at a crucial inflection point  In the food industry, when a company reaches the nine-figure mark, it is typically acquired or goes public  Since Kang s jerky business grew 49% last year, the company is a prime target  But Country Archer is still growing and quickly gaining on its next-biggest competitor, Oregon-based Tillamook Country Smoker, with $140 million in annual sales As Kangtakes on the $4 5 billion industry in which seven in ten Americans made a meat snack purchase in the past year he s focused on building an authentic and healthier brand that can hold up for decades to come But Kang will need a lot of cash to take on deep-pocketed brands like Slim Jim, owned by $12 billion food giant ConAgra The son of a South Korean immigrant who ran gas stations in the desert of Southern California, Kang has been a student of the jerky industry since he was stocking his family s stores as a kid  He and his business partner his aunt Susan share 50% ownership of Country Archer  The rest is owned by a private equity investor, Monogram Capital, which started backing Country Archer five years into Kang s tenure in 2016 ForbesestimatesCountry Archer is conservatively worth at least $300 million The brand has been a bright spot in the jerky sector which is otherwise struggling  Sales of jerky dropped more than 4% in the past year, as grocery buyers are ordering less than previous years  But Country Archer s jerky and meat sticks are the fastest-growing and have even drawn some customers away from other snacks WHY IT MATTERS  Moreaccess to healthy protein is very needed, and Country Archer is building its business by tapping into new consumers who want more out of their food,  saysForbes staff writer Chloe Sorvino   That's a movement that's not going away
