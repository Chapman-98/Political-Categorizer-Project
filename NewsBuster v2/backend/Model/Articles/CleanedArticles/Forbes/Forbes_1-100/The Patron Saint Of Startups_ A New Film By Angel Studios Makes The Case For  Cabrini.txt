On International Women s Day, one of America s buzziest movie studios released a film about an immigrant woman who came from a faraway land, and against all odds became an iconic hero in the United States and around the world You might be thinking, another Wonder Woman sequel? Maybe the next Barbie?Not exactly But close On March 8th, Angel Studios released  Cabrini,  a period drama centered on the life of Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini, affectionally known around the world as Mother Cabrini  Based on a screenplay by Rod Barr and starring Christiana Dell Anna as Cabrini, Mexican-born director Alejandro Monteverde delivers a thought-provoking look at the years around Cabrini s arrival in New York City in the late 1800s  The film also give sobering and visually arresting perspective of the the work of theand their service to impoverished immigrants in need  Cabrini  is the newest release from Angel Studios, a fast-rising Utah-based film production studio that has captured attention (and box office reciepts) for its breakaway hit,  The Sound of Freedom,  and  The Chosen,  a dramatic series focused on the life of Jesus   Cabrini  aligns with the upstart studio s focus on storytelling that has meaningful, purpose-oriented content and that bridges religious and spiritual themes with dramatic narratives  Its fan-inducing formula, including using a viewer  guild  to prescreen content and a novel approach to ticket sales, seems to be working once again with  Cabrini   Ten days after release,  Cabrini  has postive critical reviews and a Rotten Tomatoes score that many major studios would envy (90% on the  Tomatometer  and a 98% audience score) What makes  Cabrini  different than the studio s prior releases is its subject matter  A tenacious Roman Catholic nun born in 1850, Cabrini immigrated to America in 1889 on a faith-inspired mission to wade knee-deep in the horrible conditions of her fellow Italian immigrants in New York City, including in the then-destitute Italian slum of Five Points More than just a mission of faith, however, Cabrini also navigated a journey of adversity  Which is what makes her story even more powerful And one that anyone building startup or any new initiative knows all too well In the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles by male-dominated political and religious institutions, Cabrini refused to take  no  for an answer, ultimately building not only a local, but also a global network of schools and community service resources for the impoverished  As the movie makes painfully clear, each step of Cabrini s journey required audacity, ingenuity, and hope, all while navigating a world that seemingly failed to believe in her ability as a woman, and during a time in history where immigration, politics, and social inequality were explosive issues Sound familiar?To any entrepreneur and founder   especially women founders   it certainly does This is one of the many reasons J  Eustace Wolfington, a successful Philadelphia, Pennsylvania businessman and investor agreed to executive produce the new film and help make it a reality  Wolfington, whose passionate admiration of Cabrini started when he was a young man, has committed much of his life and philanthropy to advancing her vision of educating the heart as much as the head  It was Wolfington s commitment to sharing the innovative life of Cabrini with a much broader audience that led him to partner with Angel Studios Wolfington recently sat down with me in our studio for a Forbes Talk where we had awide-ranging conversationabout why the life of Cabrini matters to him, and why he believes her life should matter to the entire world  We discussed the power of faith, the reason why he chose Angel Studios as his key business partner, and why  Cabrini  is a story not just of all time, but also of our time in particular  Cabrini  is out in theaters now Have comments or feedback on the film  Cabrini  and the role of faith in media?
