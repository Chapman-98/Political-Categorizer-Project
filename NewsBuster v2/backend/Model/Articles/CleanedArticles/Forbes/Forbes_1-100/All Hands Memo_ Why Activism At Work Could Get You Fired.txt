This is a fraught issue,  says Mark Hanna, a Washington, D C -based labor and employment lawyer who represents workers   There are too many ways where employers and employees are going to fall into traps by either clamping down too hard, or risking their job by being too expressive  Everybody should be careful here  Google s case has grabbed numerous headlines, but workplace activism has been growing for years as more CEOs have taken on social and political issues whether publicly opposing bills that limit transgender rights or pledging billions to racial justice causes and as employees are increasingly encouraged, in the fashionable parlance of many managers, to  bring their whole selves to work   In a highly-charged presidential election year, as workers have more tools to criticize their employer on social media and as younger generations increasingly expect workplaces to line up with their personal or political values, the environment is ripe for more activism to find its way into the office   People do not understand that you can be fired for something as arbitrary as the boss not liking the kind of socks you wear   <footer>Cathy Creighton, director of Cornell University s Industrial and Labor Relations School s Buffalo Co-Lab</footer>Add concerns that the current pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses could spill into the workplace, and lawyers say their phones have been lighting up with employers asking for advice  Sam Schwartz-Fenwick, a labor and employment lawyer at Seyfarth Shaw in Chicago, says there s  a real fear of how to respond   Employers are asking questions like:  How do we lower the temperature? How do we remind people that their focus at work is to do work? For employees who want to engage in protests at work, the legal questions are also complex but the protections are relatively limited  By and large, there are fewer protections for employees than many people think, but there are key exceptions depending on whether the employee works for the government; is in a union with a collective bargaining agreement or has another contract in place; is covered by certain state laws; or based on what issues employees are protesting  People do not understand that you can be fired for something as arbitrary as the boss not liking the kind of socks you wear,  says Cathy Creighton, director of Cornell University s Industrial and Labor Relations School sBuffalo Co-Lab  Most employees, she says, are subject to the concept of  at will  employment, which is presumed for employees in all states but Montana  That means unless there s a specific law or contract in place that offers workers protections and makes firing illegal and there are a number of important exceptions many workers  can be fired for a good reason, a bad reason or no reason,  Creighton says One widespread misconception, employment lawyers say, is that the notion of freedom of speech extends to private workplaces  But unless someone works for the government employees of public universities, it should be noted, are typically state employees the First Amendment does not apply  Protection for freedom of speech, says Jeff Hirsch, a law professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and a former litigator with the National Labor Relations Board,  only applies to the government  Period  Google doesn t have to follow the First Amendment   Deena Merlen, an employment and labor lawyer in Connecticut, echoes that assessment  Private employees, she says, "don't have any constitutionally protected rights under federal law to say what [they] want and not be fired for it    There are too many ways where employers and employees are going to fall into traps by either clamping down too hard, or risking their job by being too expressive  Everybody should be careful here   <footer>Mark Hanna, Washington, D C  labor and employment lawyer representing workers</footer>So can workers ever speak out? Yes, but it depends on a range of specific circumstances  For instance, some individual states or local jurisdictions have protections for employees  legal off-duty political activity, or from discrimination based on political affiliation  Unions also offer some protections  Employees who have a collective bargaining agreement, or a legal contract between an employer and a labor union, typically have some protections through  just cause  a concept that s often part of union contracts and may protect workers from retaliation or unfair firings  But only about 10% of workers are members of a labor union, according to2023 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and not all members of a union have a current bargaining agreement in place In addition, even employees who aren t union members can still benefit from protections in the National Labor Relations Act, which gives private sector employees who are not in supervisory roles therightto seek better working conditions and protections from retaliation  To do so, they have to meet the standard of  protected concerted activity,  which is legal-speak that means two or more employees must be acting together  for their mutual aid or protection regarding terms and conditions of employment  That key phrase is the one lawyers say will be under scrutiny when it comes to the Google workers  charge, especially after a Februarydecisionby the Biden administration s more labor-friendly National Labor Relations Board  In it, the board sided with a Home Depot employee who refused to remove the hand-drawn letters  BLM  (a reference to the Black Lives Matter movement) from a work apron, calling it a  logical outgrowth  of earlier complaints employees had made about racial discrimination in the workplace As a result, the NLRB concluded the employee s conduct was also  for mutual aid or protection   Home Depot is appealing the decision; a spokesperson, Beth Marlowe, said in an emailed statement the company disagrees with the NLRB s decision and  is fully committed to diversity and respect for all people  We do not tolerate any kind of workplace harassment or  discrimination   The decision has gotten employers  attention   A lot of employers took notice of that,  says Lindsay Burke, a Washington, D C -based employment lawyer who represents employers  The NLRB, she says, took a  pretty expansive view of speech that on its face might look political, but then could just be tied back to concerns about the way the workplace is operating  Traditionally,  terms and conditions  was presumed to be a straightforward concept that covered wages, benefits, working hours or safety conditions   Just saying  I don't like the business my employer's engaging in  is not going to cut it,   says UNC s Hirsch But in theFebruary ruling, the NLRB appeared to make a connection between what might be unprotected workplace speech (such as wearing a Black Lives Matter button) and a history of related complaints about working conditions that might warrant protection  The case, says Risa Lieberwitz, a law professor at Cornell who is also academic director of itsWorker Institute,  is a very important decision because it makes clear that employees  expressions, through their communication about [related political or social issues]   can be linked to labor issues within the workplace  The ex-Google employees may attempt to argue something similar: Their charge filed with the NLRB said employees were terminated for participating in  a peaceful, non-disruptive protest that was directly connected to their terms and conditions of work   Meanwhile, in a Novemberopen letter published online,the No Tech For Apartheid group alleged that managers at Google had been  inappropriately using their ranks to question, report and attempt to fire  employees expressing pro-Palestinian views In response to the open letter, Google s Tomson said in a statement that  this is a highly sensitive time and topic in every company and workplace, and we have many employees who are personally affected  The overwhelming majority of those employees are not engaged in internal discussions or debate,  adding many appreciated the company s  focus on the safety of employees   Regarding the NLRB charge, the company said the protesting employees  behavior was  completely unacceptable  and that Google  carefully confirmed and reconfirmed that every single person whose employment was terminated was directly and definitively involved in disruption inside our buildings  We are confident in our position and stand by the actions we ve taken  Indeed, employment lawyers say one factor that s likely to come into play in such scenarios is whether workers speaking out are violating workplace conduct policies   The number one thing that every employer must do is provide a safe working environment for their employees,  says Rick Grimaldi, an employment lawyer with Fisher Phillips in Philadelphia, speaking generally rather than specifically about Google   If I'm Jewish and I'm going to work and I feel threatened because of it, then I think the employer has an obligation to take action to make sure the behavior stops  Still, policies should be consistently applied, lawyers say   What I would caution employers to do is to be content-neutral to have policies that apply to everything,  says Hanna, taking similar actions  whether it's a union pin, whether it's a [button with a] Palestinian flag or a rainbow flag  What about political speech and activities that employees engage in outside of work? Several states have explicit protections for some types of legal off-duty political activities  Even in other states, many employers don t want to fire people for what they do on their own time unless the actions are illegal, says David Kurtz, an employment litigation practice co-chair at Constangy, Brooks, Smith & Prophete who practices out of Boston  Ifthey're protesting on their own time  but they re seen on social media engaging in hate speech or defacing property   then [employers] would have the opportunity to take action  The Biden NLRB has weighed in here too  An August NLRBrulingappeared to expand the protections given to employees  conduct outside the workplace by setting a new standard: An employer's policies restricting off-duty activities, including speech, would need to be more narrowly tailored to serve  a legitimate and substantial business interest  For workers or students who choose to protest, there are risks for future employment, too  As it becomes easier to identify protest attendees by a mere picture one reverse Google Image picture can turn up a person s name the law doesn t offer much protection when it comes to future jobs, says Merlen, unless the employee can successfully argue they weren t hired over a protected characteristic such as their religion Workers seem to recognize that too  Says one former Google employee who worked on internal DEI initiatives and requested anonymity for fear of retaliation from future employers:  We knew that the labor law was gray  But we decided this was a risk we were willing to take  MORE FROM FORBES
