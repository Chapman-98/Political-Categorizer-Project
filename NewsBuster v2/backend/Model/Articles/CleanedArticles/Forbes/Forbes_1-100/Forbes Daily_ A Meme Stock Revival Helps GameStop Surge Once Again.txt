criminal counts in New York if not for an adult-film actress named Stormy Daniels, who claims she had sex with the real estate mogul  Trump denies the allegation, and his lawyers are working to undermine Daniels  credibility in his ongoing trial, painting her as an opportunist   That story has made you a lot of money, right?  one of Trump s attorneys asked Daniels on May 7  It has also cost me a lot of money,  Daniels replied Indeed, the story has led to quite a saga, complete with massive swings in Daniels  finances  There was the initial payoff, then the fame, the strip-club tour, the lawsuits, books, theft and more lawsuits  It s difficult to get a precise figure for how much Daniels has made off the scandal, butForbeshas put together a ballpark estimate, excluding tax payments and lots of legal expenses The conclusion: Daniels appears to have bolstered her earnings by about $1 million  A nice sum, but less than the  millions of dollars  Trump s attorney suggested she made The alleged incident happened in 2006, in a Nevada hotel  Five years later, Daniels told her story toIn Touch, expecting to receive $15,000 when the story ran  But it never did  Daniels testified that she heard Michael Cohen, Trump s former attorney, threatened to sue the magazine In 2016, with Trump running for president, Daniels had another chance to cash in  Trump, using Cohen as a middleman, bought her silence for $130,000  After paying an attorney and publicist, she walked away with $96,000 TheWall Street Journal broke news of the alleged payoff in 2018,making Stormy Daniels a household name  Despite the hush-money deal, she sensed a chance to capitalize Attention led to opportunities  Daniels signed a more lucrative deal to direct and perform in adult films  She embarked on a tour of the nation s strip clubs, with appearance fees reportedly doubling and bookings tripling  Industry experts toldForbesat the time that the scandal would likely double Daniels  annual income, estimated to previously be in the low six figures Fame, of course, can come with a cost  For Daniels, she testified that the newfound attention has led her to spend more on security, hire tutors for her daughter and move to a safer place to live WHY IT MATTERS  Trump s payment to Daniels is at the center of the former president s ongoing criminal trial in New York,  saysForbes staff writer Zach Everson   Last week, his attorneys repeatedly tried to paint Daniels as an opportunist, out to make a buck off a fabricated story  While the criminal charges pertain to the alleged payoff and not an affair, thejury s view of Daniels  credibility could influence the outcomeof the case  MORE How Michael Cohen Makes Money Hating On Donald TrumpFACTS + COMMENTSWildfires across western Canada have
