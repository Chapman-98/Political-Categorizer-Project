Noem wrote she shot her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket because the dog had an "aggressive personality" and was difficult to train. Shereportedlyuses the story to talk about her willingness "to do anything  difficult, messy and ugly." She also wrote about shooting a "nasty and mean" goat her family owned. She said the goat survived the first shot and she had to run back to her truck to get a second shell before returning to "put him down." Noem was immediately hit with backlash for the story about her dog andlater calledreports "fake news" while also defending the decision, saying the dog needed to be killed because it was "extremely dangerous."What To Watch ForNoem has been widely viewed as a possible running mate for former President Donald Trump this year but some observers think the dog excerpt couldhurt her chances.TangentA conversation between Noem and Haley recounted in "No Going Back," as quoted by Politico, has also gotten some attention. Noem says Haley offered to mentor her, but allegedly went on to say,  I ve heard a lot of really good things about you. But I also want you to know that if I hear something bad   I will be sure to let you know. " Noem said she took the conversation as a threat, and said Haley had "wanted me to know that there was only room for one Republican woman in the spotlight. It was weird." Chaney Denton, a spokesperson for Haley,told Politicohis boss "has long called and written notes supporting other women when they go through challenging times" and that she was reaching out to Noem to encourage her amid criticism of her handling of Covid-19. "How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird," she said.Further Reading
