plenty of reasons to doubt Warner Bros  Discovery The media giant, formed in 2022 from a merger between AT&T s WarnerMedia and Discovery, initially boasted a market capitalization matching the deal s $43 billion price tag But since then, its shares have languished, with market capitalization plunging to just $18 billion, largely due to what Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall called  post-merger growing pains  after its second-quarter earnings announcement last year  And things have gotten even worse In the first four months of this year, Warner Bros  Discovery shares are down 30%  Like other

Journal found that cash flows are more predictive of future stock returns than earnings WHY IT MATTERS  Investors typically favor earnings despite their potential for creative accounting, whereas free cash flow remains a truer reflection of financial health,  says Forbessenior reporter Brandon Kochkodin   Warner Bros  Discovery is advocating for a focus on its free cash flow, yet faces resistance in changing market perceptions  Nevertheless, for value investors, this focus might reveal the company as an undiscovered gem a belief that billionaire Seth Klarman seems to endorse  MORE Why The
