  <footer>Recent TikTok advertising employee</footer>Brands that sign up to advertise to TikTok s 170 million American users give the company sensitive business information to create an account details stored in a tool called  Make More Money,  also called  MMM  or  3M  for short  The internal program, built by ByteDance as its own version of Salesforce, is an all-in-one sales hub aiding in everything from customer onboarding and contracting to billing and payments, according to the documents obtained byForbes  The dashboard also provides analytics on ad performance, spending and other metrics, the documents show  (It is not customer-facing )One spreadsheet obtained byForbesshows thousands of brands and organizations that had active ad accounts with TikTok in 2023  They include everyone from niche groups like the South Dakota Department of Tourism to household names like the NFL and MLB, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer, Peloton and Sephora (none responded to requests for comment)  One of the ad account names on the list is, simply,  China   3M,  rolled out gradually to U S  staff starting in 2021, was originally built as a solution to a problem not uncommon for young companies that experience explosive growth overnight, as TikTok had when the pandemic hit in 2020  Advertiser data was being managed "really scrappily  where it could be easily downloaded, accessible, shared and seen by other team members who aren't working on that division,  said one recent TikTok advertising employee, who recalled haphazardly working off spreadsheets in Lark (called Feishu in China), ByteDance software akin to Microsoft Office or G Suite   It was just this complete improper management of advertisers' sensitive data  I was like, 'How is this being held together by a bunch of bandaids and nails?'   We are excited to announce the upcoming decoupling of 3M for TikTok and 3M China   <footer>Internal announcement about TikTok s  Make More Money  tool</footer>But even with 3M, according to three sources and internal material, privacy, security and access control issues persisted  Until partway through 2023, the Make More Money platform used by staff in the U S  and China was one in the same, the internal material shows  The system was shared at least until around the time that TikTok s CEO testified before Congress for the first time and the threat of a national ban on the app escalated  As work onProject Texas TikTok s $1 5 billion project to unwind its U S  and China operations with the help of Oracle accelerated, workers received a memo about the imminent  decoupling  of 3M for TikTok and 3M China  We are excited to announce the upcoming decoupling of 3M for TikTok and 3M China Interface,  said a communication from March 2023 obtained byForbes   Over the coming days you will see the 3M for TikTok interface live apart from the 3M China interface  Both will provide independent domain names  The change means  no more unexpected switch between the two interfaces,  the document said, and  upgraded access control of 3M for TikTok, [which] protects you from data access loss   This is honestly perfect timing,  the note concluded, without mentioning Project Texas or the heightened attention on TikTok s ownership in China Forbes also obtained several documents dated 2023 of PR-guided and  Myth vs  Fact  talking points for fielding outside partners  questions  One covered topics including Project Texas, data security and access controls, ByteDance ownership and China-based employees  Another answered queries about how TikTok uses data that businesses share with it:  We do not share any insights or reporting specific to one advertiser with another advertiser," read one response   It was common practice for employees to request access to data structures or dashboards  without providing a rationale, and it would be granted   <footer>Joel Carter, former TikTok employee focused on advertising policy</footer>The changes to this popular advertising tool illustrate TikTok s attempts to disconnect key parts of its business here from ByteDance s functions in China  But it s also another datapoint showing just how enmeshed the two have long been, and how ByteDance has historically struggled with access problems jeopardizing privacy and security Forbesreporting has repeatedly revealed the extent to which TikTok and ByteDance are entangled and data from one company is often accessible by both  The sensitive financial information of American creators and small businesses working with TikTok was stored on servers in China and accessible by ByteDance personnel there,one recent , while celebrities and politicians on the platform have had their closest personal contacts exposed to TikTok and ByteDance employees around the world, found in another TikTok declined to comment on whether the Make More Money separation was ever completed, but two ex-staffers questioned that it had been and toldForbesthe overlap continued into last summer  The request and approval processes for access to data was fast and loose,  said Joel Carter, who used Make More Money regularly while working in advertising policy at TikTok until August 2023, when he says he was wrongfully terminated   It was common practice for employees to request access to data structures or dashboards  without providing a rationale, and it would be granted  Got a tip about TikTok or ByteDance?
