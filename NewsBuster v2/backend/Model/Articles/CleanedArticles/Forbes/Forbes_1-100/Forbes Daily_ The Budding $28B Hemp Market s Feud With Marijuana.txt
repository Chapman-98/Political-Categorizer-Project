And this year there s even more to celebrate, as38 states have some form of legal cannabis, and the majority of Americans support legalization, regardless of political party  Plus, the DEA is reviewing an HHS recommendation to reclassify cannabis, which is currently in the same category as heroin Still, marijuana remains illegal federally, andnational legalization could take some time  That s led to major hurdles for legal cannabis companies, like not being able to sell their products across state lines  A budding hemp market has sprung up as a result (more on that below) Nonetheless, leaders in the industry are transforming cannabis from a criminal enterprise into a legitimate one  In ourthird-annual Cannabis 42 0 list,Forbes identified 42 people who are blazing that path FIRST UP<figure><figcaption>Getty Images</figcaption></figure>More people want to buy homes, butthey re struggling with high interest rates and rising prices, a new report from the National

Nathanson DAILY COVER STORYThe Cannabis Civil War: Hemp vs  Marijuana<figure><figcaption>Justin Journay, the CEO and founder of 3Chi, which makes hemp-derived products DANIEL BROWN FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINEMarijuana remains illegal federally, but its cannabis cousin,hemp, has exploded into a $28 billion industry with products that can legally get you high  In 2018, the federal government legalized hemp and all its derivatives, isomers and extracts through what s known as the Farm Bill  And since hemp and marijuana are different varieties of the same plant, they contain the same compounds and hemp can be used to make products of similar potencies, or even stronger, than those found in state-regulated marijuana dispensaries around the country Armed with the Farm Bill, companies like Indiana-based 3Chi and its competitors sell these hemp-derived products online, across state lines, at gas stations, convenience stores and other places where marijuana is still outlawed  As a result, hemp is becoming a bigger industry than state-regulated marijuana  In 2022, hemp product sales reached $28 billion while legal marijuana products generated $26 billion in sales during that same period, according to cannabis data firm Whitney Economics But that massive hemp market operates in a gray area  Hemp-derived cannabinoids, including delta-9 and delta-8 THC, are legal under the Farm Bill so long as they contain 0 3% THC or less  What is not entirely clear is if hemp products made by converting the non-psychoactive cannabinoid CBD into THC through a chemical process, which is how most intoxicating hemp products on the market are made, including 3Chi s, makes them illegal controlled substances or not  The DEA says synthetically derived THC is illegal, but their definition of  synthetic  is a bit inconsistent, leaving room for debate And theanimosity between the hemp and marijuana industries is growing  Cannabis companies and lobbyists are urging lawmakers to outlaw hemp products on the state and federal level, especially since hemp companies are subject to far less onerous regulations  It is, to an extent, a civil war,  says Justin Journay, founder of 3Chi  But, ironically, some of those same marijuana companies that want to see hemp products removed from the market are also dabbling in them  Massachusetts-based Curaleaf, founded by billionaire Boris Jordan, is selling hemp-derived THC edibles online, shipping products to customers in 24 states, including Texas and Indiana WHY IT MATTERS Chris Lindsey, a lawyer and director of state advocacy and public policy at the American Trade Association for Cannabis and Hemp, says that intoxicating hemp products areboth legal and illegal at the same time  In a world without federal enforcement, people are willing to gamble and take it as far as they can,  he says   The reality is that there are no rules  MOREWhy Hemp-Derived THC Drinks Are Riding HighBUSINESS + FINANCEO J
