pandemic ushered in remote and hybrid work models for many, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 77% of workers did no remote work in March 2024 Still, it appears that remote work at least in a

STORY<figure><figcaption>ILLUSTRATION BY STEPHANIE CUI FOR FORBES; PHOTO BY JEFF GRITCHEN/MEDIANEWS GROUP/ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Temu, the Chinese e-commerce giant known for impossibly cheap products and aggressive growth in the U S , isextending censorship mandated by the Chinese government to the American market Not only does it restrict search terms for politically sensitive topics in China like Xi Jinping, Dalai Lama, and Chinese Communist Party it is also censoring search results for American political topics as well Keyword searches for  Trump,   Biden,   election,   president  and  MAGA,  which generate thousands of results for U S -based retailers,return no hits on Temu, despite the fact that such items are actually listed on the platform  Hundreds of Trump and Biden-themed products are available for purchase on the site, but searching for  Trump  pulls up nothing  Other terms like  freedom  or  USA  result in Trump merch like a coffee mug or or flag By contrast, Amazon returns over 10,000 results for Biden, and over 30,000 for Trump  Walmart s website yields more than 1,000 listings for Biden and Trump each  Target shows 24 results for  Biden,  and 139 results for  Trump,  all of them books Temu also does not return searches for  Israel,   Palestine,   Palestinian  and  Hamas   But it does return results for  Nazi  and  Hitler,  which yield numerous German-language and Germany-themed products, such as lapel pins of the German flag  (None of the products appear to include actual Nazi memorabilia )Longtime retail industry experts say that censoring some search terms istypical behavior for a China-based retailer serving purely domestic customers, especially since Temu s sellers are almost entirely based in China  But it s not clear why Temu has extended this practice of restricting search terms within the U S , where it had an average of 20 million monthly users in the first quarter of 2024, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, up 134% year-over-year  And while Temu s policies say it bans products that violate national laws, its policies list no specific ban on political terms or items  Temu declined to comment WHY IT MATTERS  I get why they would not show results for banned topics in China, but not showing results for U S  topics is odd,  Juozas Kaziuk nas, the CEO of Marketplace Pulse, an independent e-commerce analysis firm, toldForbes   Temu seems to be trying to preemptively avoid embarrassment or bad PR, but no other retailer approaches the same way  MORE How TikTok Shop Became
