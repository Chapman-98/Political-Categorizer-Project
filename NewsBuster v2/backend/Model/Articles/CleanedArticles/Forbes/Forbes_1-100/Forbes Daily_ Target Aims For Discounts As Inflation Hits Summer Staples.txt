STORY<figure><figcaption>ILLUSTRATION BY YUNJIA YUAN FOR FORBES; PHOTO BY ALEXLMX-GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Seemingly overnight, Chinese e-commerce site Temu, along with its fast-growing competitor Shein, became so popular with American consumers that it spiked prices for fast shipping by airplane from China,creating a cargo crunch that s altering global trade routes Temu, which largely sells clothing and housewares, and Shein, which built its brand on fast-fashion and has since expanded to consumer electronics and kitchen items, are unlike other retailers in that they sell items made directly by no-name Chinese companies, rather than selling an American brand that is made overseas  Part of their low cost has come from their decision to ship directly from China from those manufacturers, rather than working with well-known American brands that impose greater costs, prices and quality But to get customers  their products in a reasonable amount of time, both companies have been relying heavily on air freight  Temu and Shein combined ship around 9,000 tons of cargo worldwide every day, or approximately 88 Boeing 777 freighters filled to the brim, according to February research from Cargo Facts Consulting That sdriven up prices to near-unprecedented levels  According to the latest figures from Xeneta, so far, the May air cargo  average spot rate  from southern China to the U S  is now at about $4 75 per kilogram, the highest it s been since the end of last year, rivaling what s typically peak demand in the run-up to the holiday season  That s more than double than during the same period in 2019 Sending cargo by air is always considerably faster and more expensive than shipping by sea, which can carry a much larger volume of goods, albeit at a slower pace For now, Shein and Temu provide free shipping for orders over a certain size, seemingly willing to absorb the higher costs as a shortcut to accelerated growth in the U S  But that could change over the medium to longer-termas the companies look for ways to cut costs now that they re both established e-commerce platforms WHY IT MATTERS  Shein and Temu s growth is predicated on fast and relatively expensive air freight,  saysForbes senior writer Cyrus Farivar   Their rapid rise is so huge that they have had a material effect on China-U S  rates, which illustrates the size of their economic power For now, these companies are willing to absorb that high cost, but it may be unsustainable over the long term  MORE Chinese Shopping App Temu Censors Searches For  Trump  And
