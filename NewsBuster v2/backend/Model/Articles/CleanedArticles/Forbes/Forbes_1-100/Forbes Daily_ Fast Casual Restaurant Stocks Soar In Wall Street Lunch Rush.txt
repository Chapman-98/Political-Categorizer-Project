Prokopiou and Marinakis, who are worth $2.6 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, have ordered 123 new ships worth nearly $13 billion since 2022, according to VesselsValue. Prokopiou s four shipping firms own 173 tankers including those under construction, 54 more than they owned in 2021.These maritime moguls arepart of a new generation of Greek billionaires making waves on land and sea. Altogether,Forbesestimates there are now at least 12 shipping billionaires in Greece, more than at any other time in history. Seven of them are making their debut inForbes billionaire ranks. They are worth a collective $32 billion the equivalent of roughly 12% of the country s gross domestic product.These tycoons are the latest in a line of swashbuckling pioneers hailing back to iconic figures like Aristotle Onassis and Stavros Niarchos, who launched the global oil tanker trade after World War II and became famous for their glamorous marriages and lifestyles.This newer group has been in shipping for decades but kept a lower profile. What s new is that the value of their holdings particularly tankers has soared by billions of dollars over the past two years, as the war in Ukraine sent shockwaves through global commodities markets and set off a scramble for large tankers needed to ferry oil around the world.WHY IT MATTERS  After Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. and Europe moved to ban seaborne imports of Russian oil and later imposed a price cap on Russian oil, designed to limit Putin s profits while ensuring that oil would keep flowing,  saysForbes staff writer Giacomo Tognini.  Many Western firms decided to quit the trade altogether, deeming it too risky, but not the Greeks. Between April 2022 and February 2024, Greek firms shipped 28% of all Russian oil exports,according to an analysis from the Kyiv School of Economics  KSE Institute, based on data from commodities intelligence firm Kpler.
