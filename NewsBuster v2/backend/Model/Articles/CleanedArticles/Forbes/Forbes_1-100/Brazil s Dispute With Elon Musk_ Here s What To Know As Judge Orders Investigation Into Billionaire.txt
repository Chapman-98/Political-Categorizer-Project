The attack ultimately failed to instigate a military coup, and instead resulted in the arrests of over 400 rioters. In the aftermath of the attack, Alexandre de Moraes emerged as apolarizing figurein Brazilian politics as he launched far-reaching investigations and prosecutions of those responsible, including Bolsonaro himself. In February 2022, de Moraes began a probe into  digital militias  aligned with Bolsonaro and his allies. According to a police report obtained byReuters, evidence suggests these groups of online influencers conduct "orchestrated action" to spread fake news and election fraud conspiracies. Although Bolsonaro s allies have denounced de Moraes s efforts as politically motivated, members of Lula s inner circle have praised his efforts.  It is urgent to regulate social networks,  Brazil s Attorney General Jorge Messias said in apost on Xon Saturday.  We cannot live in a society in which billionaires domiciled abroad have control of social networks and put themselves in a position to violate the rule of law, failing to comply with court orders and threatening our authorities. Social Peace is non-negotiable. Crucial Quote SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT A LAWLESS LAND! SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT NO MAN S LAND!  de Moraes wrote in hisdecision.  The dignity of the human person, the protection of the lives of children and adolescents and the maintenance of the Democratic Rule of Law are above the financial interests of social network providers and private messaging services.
