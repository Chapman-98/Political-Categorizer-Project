IMAGES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINEHop in a time machine back to late 2022, and you ll probably hear a lot of economists talk about a coming recession  that ultimately never arrived  Then it shifted to the U S  recession coming in 2024, but so far, theirrepressible American economy has refused to play along At the start of the year, investors around the world were looking foras many as six quarter-point interest rate cutsfrom the Federal Reserve to protect economic growth and fight inflation  But inflation has stayed stubbornly above the central bank s 2% target and the economy keeps growing despite an overnight interest rate target range of 5 25-5 5%, the most among the Group of Seven industrial countries By early February those six rate cuts had become three, and on Wednesday,
