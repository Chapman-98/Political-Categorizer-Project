the Truth and Courage super PAC  (Photo by Kyle Rivas/Getty Images)Getty Images</figcaption></figure>Government watchdogs Campaign Legal Center and End Citizens United accused Ted Cruz of violating federal campaign finance laws by directing ad revenue from his podcast to a super PAC, according to a complaint the groups filed with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday The complaint comes after the pro-Cruz Truth and Courage PAC raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars from iHeartMedia, the company that produces Cruz s podcast In October 2022, the Texas Republican announced that the audio companyhad offered to fund and market his bootstrapped podcast,  Verdict with Ted Cruz    This thing for the podcast is just a big damn deal,  Cruz said on the episode that announced the arrangement   iHeartRadio is a monster   iHeartMedia is also a registered lobbyist, having spent $50 million on lobbying members of Congress since 2003  The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 bars lawmakers from  knowingly accept[ing] a gift from a registered lobbyist  According to Senate rules, services can qualify as gifts The following month,Campaign Legal Center filed a complaintwith the Senate Select Committee on Ethics  Cruz s office, however, contended that the deal was above board   Senator Cruz receives no financial benefit from  Verdict,   a campaign spokesperson toldForbesat the time   There is no difference between Sen  Cruz appearing on a network television show, a cable news show or a podcast airing on iHeartMedia   In February, the Senate Ethics panel informed the watchdog that it determined Cruz did not violate federal law and it would not pursue any further action There are notable differences between what Cruz was doing and a typical television appearance, however, according to Campaign Legal Center and End Citizens United s new complaint, this time filed with the FEC Last month, Truth and Courage, a super PAC whose focus is  ensuring that Ted Cruz is re-elected,  reported beingpaid $215,000 by iHeartMedia for  digital revenue  A review of the super PAC s past filings revealed four additional payments, dating back to March 2023,bringing Truth and Courage s total haul from iHeartMedia to $630,000 After the March filing, Rachel Nelson, vice president of public relations at Premiere Networks, the iHeart subsidiary that handles  Verdict,  toldForbesthe company sells advertising inventory for the podcast  The revenue the super PAC reported is  associated with those advertising sales,  she said, which was  a common practice   Nelson said Cruz  volunteers his time to host this podcast and isn t compensated for it,  though the terms of Cruz s agreement with iHeartMedia are not public According to Campaign Legal Center and End Citizens United, iHeart s payments to Truth and Courage PAC violate campaign finance laws in two ways Federal candidates or people working on their behalf are prohibited from soliciting, receiving, directing, transferring or spending funds if they fail to comply with contribution limits, source prohibitions and reporting requirements  (These types of funds are commonly called  soft money  ) Super PACs, like Truth and Courage, are allowed to accept unlimited contributions and can take money from corporations  Campaigns for federal offices, however, can t accept more than $5,000 per election, nor can they take any donations from corporations  As a result, candidates are not allowed to coordinate with super PACs Campaign Legal Center and End Citizens United allege that s what happened here  Thegroups argued in their Tuesday filingthat  the most reasonable and logical inference to be drawn from these circumstances, however, is that Cruz requested or directed, and iHeartMedia agreed, that iHeartMedia would transmit these funds to the Truth and Courage PAC, which then would use the funds to support Cruz s candidacy  The complaint also accuses Truth and Courage of misreporting the funds it received from iHeart, stating that the money should have been reported as contributions rather than  Other Federal Receipts (Dividends, Interest, etc )   The complaint claims that,  iHeartMedia s revenues from ad sales are the corporation s funds, and whenever it transmits those funds to Truth and Courage, it has made a  contribution  to Truth and Courage that Truth and Courage is required to report accordingly  Spokespeople for Cruz, Truth and Courage and iHeartMedia did not immediately respond to requests for comment  This article will be updated with any responses  There is a reason why federal candidates are legally prohibited from using  soft money  that is, money raised outside the scope of federal election law to power their campaigns  This type of funding risks putting the priorities of wealthy special interests above everyone else and makes our political process more vulnerable to corruption,  said Erin Chlopak, Campaign Legal Center s senior director of campaign finance, in a statement   To give Texas voters clarity, the Federal Election Commission must swiftly investigate this matter and determine whether Sen  Cruz played a role in directing this transfer   Cruz is up for re-election this year While it could take years for the FEC to wrap up any investigation, iHeart s payments to Truth and Courage may be on the decline anyway  Following the news that the PAC supporting Cruz was getting money with ties to its commercials, at least one advertiser requested its ads stop being served on  Verdict  Houston-based oil company BP America s head of U S  media affairs and external communications Ross Parman told the Dallas Morning Newslast week it was  never informed that media spend was going directly to a super PAC   He saidBP instructed iHeartMedia to remove its advertisingfrom  any podcasts that direct advertising revenue to campaigns, PACs or political parties,  including Cruz s Cruz has been the subject of at least two other complaints in the past few years, in addition to the earlier one regarding his podcast deal  In September, theFEC cleared him of misusing campaign fundsto promote one of his books, but only after he provided an affidavit showing that he donated his royalties to a nonprofit  And in 2021, seven senate Democrats filed a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee overCruz s alleged role in the January 6 insurrection  Any results of that inquiry have not been made public yet Campaign Legal Center is a nonpartisan nonprofit that aims to advance democracy at the federal, state and local levels  It was founded by Trevor Potter, a Republican former chair of the FEC End Citizens United aims to get big money out of politics and protect the right to vote  Its staff consists of veteran Democratic operatives More From Forbes
