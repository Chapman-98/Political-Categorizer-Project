FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINESerial entrepreneur Ankur Jain, founder of fintech Bilt Rewards, has become a billionaire by creating a membership rewards program for house and apartment renters across the country Jain founded Bilt Rewards in 2019  When a friend with experience in the hospitality industry mentioned how much hotels and airlines actually make from their rewards programs, Jaingot the idea to bring that to the rental industry  After all, it s a huge opportunity:44 million U S  households pay rent,often their highest expenditure each month  But what if they could earn the equivalent of frequent flier miles or American Express points?His creation has caught on with renters, property owners and rewards partners  While he won t disclose how many people are using its app,Bilt says it has signed up property owners with a total of 4 million rentals(apartments and single family homes) in thousands of cities plus more than a dozen airlines, several large hotel chains, gyms and restaurants  And it has turned Jain into a new billionaire In January, Bilt Rewards raised $200 million from venture capital investors, who valued the company at $3 1 billion  With his 36% stake in Bilt plus other investments, the34-year-old CEO is worth an estimated $1 2 billion   That $3 1 billion is a fat valuation for a rather young company, but Jain sees lots of room to grow, having signed up less than 10% of the nation s rentals so far and with plenty of other potential partners to pursue Despite its strong start,not everyone is happy with the fintech Dozens of disgruntled Bilt customers have taken to Reddit to air their complaints Last year, it was mainly about long waits for not very helpful customer service  Earlier this month, they were upset about an email sent in error telling some members their accounts were being shut down  Jain says the company has ramped up its customer service  And Bilt gave 250 points to the people who received the erroneous email WHY IT MATTERS  It s a nice perk for renters, many of whom could use a hand,  saysForbes assistant managing editor Kerry Dolan   TheU S  tax code supports homeowners more so than

Experian, Equifax and TransUnion for free; the goal is to help renters increase their credit score  Traditionally, renters  on-time payments haven t been taken into account when determining the credit
