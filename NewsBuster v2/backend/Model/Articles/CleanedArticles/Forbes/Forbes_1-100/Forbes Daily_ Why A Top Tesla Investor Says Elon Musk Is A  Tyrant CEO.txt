The former University of Iowa standout and the all-time leading scorer in NCAA basketball history signed with Nike for what is believed to be the most lucrative endorsement contract in women s basketball, reportedly worth as much as $28 million over eight years.Yet even with her Nike deal, and other lucrative partnerships with Gatorade, State Farm and Gainbridge, Clark did not earn enough to be amongthe world s 50 highest-paid athletes this year in fact, no woman did.The highest-paid female athlete in 2023, Polish tennis sensation Iga  wi tek, collected an estimated $23.9 million in total earnings, just over half of the $45.2 million it took to rank among 2024 s top 50 athletes overall.Serena Williams was the only woman among the world s 50 highest-paid athletes last year her sixth time making the list in the last decade but she is now retired and no longer eligible. Only three other women have landed in the top 50 since 2012 retired tennis stars Maria Sharapova and Li Na, as well as Naomi Osaka, who is still ramping up a sponsor portfolio that once peaked at an estimated $60 million annually after a long injury absence and welcoming her first child last year.Much of the issue stems from the fact thaton-field earnings, or salaries and prize money, is tied to league revenue. Broadcasting income is a crucial stream, and Deloitte projects women s elite sports will collectively generate $340 million from that category in 2024. The WNBA, for example, currently reaps around $60 million annually from media rights, and commissioner Cathy Engelbert recently told CNBC that she aimed to  at least double our rights fees.  By comparison, the NBA earns around $3 billion from its deals, a mark that is expected to double after the next round of renegotiations.An increasing amount ofmoney flowing into women s sports is already shifting the landscape, though. Deloitte estimates the combined total revenue of women s professional sports will reach $1.28 billion this year, which is at least 300% more than the company s projection three years ago.WHY IT MATTERS  The gap may be steep, butthe top-earning female athletes are making real progress,  saysForbes staff writer Justin Birnbaum.  The median of last year s top 20 rose to $8.5 million from $7.3 million in 2022, and eight athletes posted estimated total earnings of $10 million or greater, doubling the mark from three years ago. Plus, more brands are seeing the business case for endorsing female athletes, and in addition to Clark, there s a slew of young, marketable stars coming up through the ranks, including Angel Reese and Cameron Brink in the WNBA, Nelly Korda and Rose Zhang in golf, and  wi tek, Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka in tennis.
