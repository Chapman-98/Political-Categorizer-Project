not Wall Street "GUERIN BLASK FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>Justin Ishbia, founder of Chicago-based private equity firm Shore Capi­tal Partners, has made a fortune for himself and his investors with a $7 billion portfolio The health care-focused microcap investment firm sealed 801 deals from 2020 to 2023, making itone of the world s busiest buyout shops Its assets under management soared sevenfold to $7 billion during that period, as stellar returns convinced early investors like the University of Notre Dame and Sequoia Capi­tal s wealth management arm to steadily boost their commitments  But with its 15th anniversary this year, Shore remains a minnow in the ocean of private equity where the largest fish, such as Apollo, Blackstone and KKR, oversee more than $500 billion apiece  That s by design Staying small is working out big time: Shore s average internal rate of return on its 14 exits, all in health care, is 53%, net of fees  That s nearly triple the average net

million) since Shore s 2009 founding and rolled them up into 61 larger chains of things inclu­ding autism treatment clinics, bakeries and exterminators Shore then invests in computer systems and
