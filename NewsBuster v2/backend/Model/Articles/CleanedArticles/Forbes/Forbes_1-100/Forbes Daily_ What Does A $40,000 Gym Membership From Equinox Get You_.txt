buyers don t actually gain access to the card; instead, they get what s called a tradeline, which is what the credit bureaus call each credit card account listed on an individual s credit history report They are paying for the benefit of the card s favorable characteristics its long account history, high credit limits and impeccable on-time payment record to appear on their own credit reports  The richer the card s history and the larger its credit line, the higher the fee it commands  After a few months, the seller removes the buyer from the card and opens up the spot for the next customer to piggyback off their sterling credit profile On the website of San Diego based broker Tradeline Supply Company, a three-year-old Capital One card with a $5,000 limit was recently listed at $322  Meanwhile, a 19-year-old Chase card with a $69,700 limit was priced at $1,955 almost as much as the average American household spends on housing each month Thereappears to be quite a big mark-up involved Social media influencer Amber Smith says she earned $40 from a sale that Tradeline Supply priced at $275  Darren Iba, Tradeline Supply s chief operations officer, wouldn t discuss the company s revenue or mark-ups, but did take pains to point out that the company isn t promising buyers results   Many consumers make the mistake of thinking that tradelines arbitrarily boost credit scores, however, this is not necessarily true,  he says Despite Iba s disclaimer, tradeline buyers obviously believe it s a quick and effective way to hack their credit scores, getting a temporary boost that might qualify them for credit lines and loans or for lower rates than they could get otherwise  And there s some evidence it can work But there are also plenty of critics  For sellers, the main risk is getting their card canceled if the issuer catches wind of the tradeline selling  Then there s the slim chance, albeit a scary one, that a buyer might finagle their way into actually charging purchases on the account, even without a physical card WHY IT MATTERS  The stakes are high when it comes to manipulating credit scores,  saysForbes senior reporter Brandon Kochkodin   Individuals are shelling out significant sums to boost their credit scores through tradelines, with no guarantee of success  Those selling their tradelines risk damaging their own credit for minimal financial gain a gamble that might not pay off  But the broader concern lies inthe integrity of the credit scoring system itself  When people manipulate their scores, it could potentially destabilize this system, leading to higher borrowing costs for everyone in the long run  MORE How To Buy A Small Business With No Money DownFACTS + COMMENTSA federal programproviding financial assistance to 23 million
