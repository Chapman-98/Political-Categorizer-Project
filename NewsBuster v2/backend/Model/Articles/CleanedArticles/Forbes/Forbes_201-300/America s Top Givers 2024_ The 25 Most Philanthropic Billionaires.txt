Four newcomers join billionaires including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and MacKenzie Scott in the ranks of the nation s most generous donors.By Forbes Wealth Team, Forbes StaffAmerica s 25 biggest philanthropists doled out billions of dollars in grants to a wide range of causes last year, from medical and scientific research to environmental sustainability to legal services for low-income Americans. And ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November this year, several of these philanthropists focused their giving on groups that strengthen democracy.Altogether, the lifetime giving of these 25 philanthropists through December 30, 2023 rose to nearly $211 billion, up about 7% from last year s total,Forbesfound. New giving just in 2023 by the members of this year s list totaled nearly $25 billion.But that increase in charitable giving pales in comparison to the rise in their fortunes in the past year. The 25 biggest givers are together now worth an estimated $1.35 trillion up an astonishing 44% more than a year ago, largely thanks to a dramatic rise in U.S. stocks.Warren Buffett tops our list as the biggest giver for the fourth year in a row, with $56.7 billion in lifetime giving. The 93-year-old CEO of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway who also gave away the most in 2023 is on a mission to make sure that he doesn t leave his heirs a fortune.  My children, along with their father, have a common belief that dynastic wealth, though both legal and common in much of the world including the United States, is not desirable,  Buffett wrote in a statement he issued in November to accompany a gift of Berkshire shares to four family charitable foundations. Still, he s only donated 30% of his fortune, in part because the value of his Berkshire Hathaway stock keeps rising.MacKenzie Scott continues to give away billions of dollars a year faster than just about anyone else in the ranking, to a wide variety of nonprofits in the U.S. and countries like Brazil and India. In December, the novelist and former wife of Jeff Bezos published a list of the 360 nonprofits to which she d donated a combined $2.15 billion during 2023. That brings her lifetime giving in less than five years to nearly $16.6 billion to 1,954 groups more than all but four others on this list, all of whom have been at this for at least three times as many years. Scott, who received a 4% stake in Amazon as part of the divorce settlement with Bezos in 2019, now owns just under 2% of the company, per a recent regulatory filing.Four newcomers join the ranks of the biggest givers. One, Barbara Picower, created the JPB Foundation in 2011, two years after her husband, billionaire investor Jeffry Picower, died; he was the biggest beneficiary of Bernie Madoff s Ponzi scheme. In a settlement with U.S. authorities, she agreed to return $7.2 billion to the victims of Madoff s fraud in 2010. But there were billions of dollars more in Jeffry Picower s estate as a result of his investing, which over the yearsBarbara has contributedto the JPB Foundation. The other newcomers: Home Depot cofounder Bernie Marcus and his wife Billi; cable TV pioneer Amos Hostetter Jr. and his wife Barbara, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife Wendy.The newcomers replace two entrants on last year s list who have since died: Duty Free Shoppers cofounderChuck Feeney, who was hailed as an inspiration for the Giving Pledge, and Intel cofounder Gordon Moore (d. March 2023) and his wife Betty Moore (d. Dec. 2023). Together the four newcomers have given away just under $8 billion so far   about the same amount as Feeney did. Two others missed the cut this year: CNN founder Ted Turner and credit card tycoon T. Denny Sanford. The cutoff to make the list this year is $1.44 billion in lifetime giving, up from $1.4 billion a year ago.Thirteen of the 25 have signed the Giving Pledge, promising to donate at least half of one s fortune during their lifetime or at their death. So far, of these philanthropists, only George Soros has given away more than half his fortune, though he s not one of the 13 to have signed on to the pledge.Methodology:Our estimates factor in the total lifetime giving of Americans through the end of 2023, measured in dollars given to charitable recipients; we are not including money parked in a foundation that has yet to do any good. To that end, we also do not include gifts that have been pledged but not yet paid out, or money given to donor-advised funds opaque, tax-advantaged accounts that have neither disclosure nor distribution requirements unless the giver shared details about the grants that were actually paid out by such entities. For giving as a percent of net worth, we add lifetime giving to net worth and then divide lifetime giving into that total. This is a list of individuals and couples who are U.S. citizens; as a result, we exclude extended families like the Waltons, controlling shareholders of Walmart, and big givers like Hansjoerg Wyss, who lives in the U.S. but is a Swiss citizen. We also don t list deceased individuals. Net worths are as of February 9, 2024. Here s the full list of America s 25 most generous givers:  <figure><figcaption>Tmothy Archibald</figcaption></figure>Warren Buffett Lifetime giving: $56.7 billion, +$5.2 billion vs. year agoGiving focus: Health, poverty alleviationNet worth: $131 billionGiving as percent of net worth: 30%The Berkshire Hathaway CEO, now 93, promised to give away more than 99% of his fortune  during my lifetime or at death  in his letter joining the Giving Pledge an effort that he founded with Bill and Melinda Gates to encourage charitable giving by billionaires in 2010. Buffett has been donating billions of dollars of Berkshire stock annually since 2006 to The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and to four foundations set up by his three children and his late wife. Meanwhile, Buffett s fortune has tripled from $42 billion in early 2006 due to a steady climb in the price of Berkshire Hathaway stock, which means there s still a heck of a lot left to donate $130 billion, at this point in order to meet his giving goal.<figure><figcaption>Elaine Thompson/AP</figcaption></figure>Bill Gates & Melinda French Gates Lifetime giving: $42.5 billion, +$4.1 billionGiving focus: Health, poverty alleviationNet worth: $125 billion, $10.6 billionGiving as a percent of combined net worth: 24%Bill and Melinda continue to co-chair the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, despite their 2021 divorce.Forbescounts the former couple s donations as a combined number. Their foundation, which among other things works to vaccinate children in poor countries, has been increasing its annual budget. In January the foundation announced an $8.6 billion budget, up $300 million from last year. Its goal is $9 billion in annual distributions by 2026. The foundation is one of the backers of a multi-year clinical trial of a new vaccine for pulmonary tuberculosis, a form of TB that doesn t get much protection from the TB vaccine currently given to infants and children.<figure><figcaption>Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg</figcaption></figure>George Soros Lifetime giving: $21 billion, +$2.6 billionGiving focus: Democracy, human rightsNet worth: $6.7 billionGiving as percent of net worth: 65%Over the course of three decades, hedge fund founder George Soros, now 93, put $32 billion of his fortune into Open Society Foundations, which in turn says it has spent $21 billion through the end of 2022.

Open Society Foundations encompasses a number of funding entities; in the U.S., its Open Society Institute is a registered charitable foundation that has $4.5 billion in net assets.
