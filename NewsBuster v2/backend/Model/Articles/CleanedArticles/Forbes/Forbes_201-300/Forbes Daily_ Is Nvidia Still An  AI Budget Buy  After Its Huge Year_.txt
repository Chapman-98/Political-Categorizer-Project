startup shared its idea for a tech Shangri-La with Bhutan s royal government, the kingdom disavowed the project  Now, it s preparing to announce its own mindfulness-focused  megacity  ILLUSTRATION BY FORBES; 3000AD</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE In 2021, South African-American entrepreneur Art Finch began pitching government officials in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan on a moonshot idea: transforming Gelephu, a sleepy, scenic town on its border with neighboring India, into an experimental,  eco-industrial  charter city  It would be acommercial paradise of green architecture and sustainable industry  More importantly, Finch s startup, backed by one of billionaire Peter Thiel s VC firms, had secured letters of intent from 19 foreign tech companies to become inaugural tenants in Yung Drung City, which it claimed would provide aneconomic jolt to a country still emerging from decades of self-imposed isolation In a royal address Sunday, the  Dragon King  Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck officially announced the new  megacity   Neither Thiel nor any of the project s Silicon Valley investors appear to have been involved Though the royal megacity bears marked similarities to the startup s vision, it will proceed as an entirely sovereign endeavor  The Bhutan Mindfulness City,  as it s known within the government, is being planned by McKinsey & Company and Singaporean city-planning consultancy Cistri, according to two sources close to the project These designs imagine a dense urban center supported by industry pillars such as wellness, tourism, research and development, and cryptocurrency  It would also be infused with Buddhist principles that underscore Bhutan s national religion: Any industries that enable killing, like weapons manufacturing, will be prohibited WHY IT MATTERS Against a backdrop of failed government projects, like its $1 billion  Education City  which has been quietly repurposed as a sovereign bitcoin mine,Mindfulness City could face strong opposition from Bhutan s nearly 800,000 citizens Though the project has yet to be formally announced, it remains an open secret among Bhutanese residents, and fears of government land grabs and the displacement of farmers in Gelephu have already taken root, according to several Bhutanese residents MORE Bhutan Built A Bitcoin Mine On The Site Of Its Failed  Education City FACTS AND
