Key BackgroundBiden is facingthree chargestied to his possession of a firearm: two counts of making false statements on a firearms form and one count of possessing a firearm as an unlawful user of a controlled substance. The charges came after a plea deal that Trump called a  sweetheart deal  that would have settled the tax and gun charges against Biden fell through. The plea dealfell apartafter prosecutors implied Biden could face additional charges because the investigation was still ongoing. The charges stem from a probe into Biden that started under Trump and regarded his financial dealings, but ultimately expanded to encompass his taxes and the 2018 gun purchase. Biden pleaded not guiltyto the gun charges which carry a combined maximum penalty of $750,000 in fines and 25 years in prison last month.
