Imploding<figure><figcaption>William  John  Berger, Sunnova Energy International s CEO, at his Houston headquartersGUERIN BLASK FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Theglory days for residential solar power in the United States weren t that long ago  In 2022, a record six gigawatts of peak generating capacity were installed on 700,000 rooftops, bringing total residential solar power to 40 GWs nearly enough to power Los Angeles and Phila­delphia combined The boom was partly fueled by falling prices for solar panels and inverters as more countries, including the U S , jumped in to compete against China  Topping it off, in August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, an orgy of renewable energy subsidies which boosted the solar tax credit from 26% to 30% and extended it through 2032 meaning Uncle Sam is on the hook for maybe $8 billion a year for at least a decade Despite all this, the residential solar industry is in serious trouble  Sharply rising interest rates have sapped both growth in demand for new residential systems, which are typically financed, and the value of $21 billion in debt issued to install existing systems  High interest rates are what Sunlight Financial, a residential solar financier, blamed when it filed for bankruptcy in October  (It went public in 2021 via a SPAC )Two days after Sunlight sought Chapter 11 protection, San Francisco-based Sunrun, the largest player in residential solar with annual revenue of $2 3 billion, said it was writing off $1 2 billion in goodwill, primarily from the $3 2 billion acquisition of Vivint Solar in 2020 The interest rate spike is drawing attention to other problems in an industry built not only on cheap money but also on suspect accoun­ting and a tax credit regime (born in 2005) that has invited aggressive and in some cases fraudulent claims WHY IT MATTERS The residential solar business has always faced one big obstacle: high upfront costs  A new 7 5-kilowatt residential rooftop solar system costs between $20,000 and $45,000  That expense is mitigated somewhat by the tax code, but claiming federal subsidies is not simple  An individual federal tax credit should eventually kick back 30% of that tab to the homeowner, but the credit is nonrefundable meaning you can claim it only against income taxes you paid or owed in the year you installed the panels and in subsequent years The bottom line: Most families can t or won t pay out of pocket for the upfront cost of installation MORE The Inflation Reduction Act Is Very Good At One Thing: Making Billionaires
