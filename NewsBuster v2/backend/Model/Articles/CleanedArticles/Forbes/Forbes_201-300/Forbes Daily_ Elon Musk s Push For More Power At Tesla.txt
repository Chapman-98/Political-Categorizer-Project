Down Scotts Miracle-Gro<figure><figcaption>Pot almost took us down," says Scotts Miracle-Gro CEO Jim Hagedorn STEPHEN WEBSTER FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Over nearly a decade, Ohio-basedlawn care giant Scotts Miracle-Gro madea series of audacious bets on the legal cannabis industry it spent $1 7 billion building pot-focused subsidiary Hawthorne Gardening Company and acquiring grow-light manufacturers, hydroponic supply outfits, plant nutrient makers and other cannabis cultivation supply companies Now, CEO Jim Hagedornadmits the venture has been an abject failure  Back in 2015, when only four states had legalized recreational marijuana, Hawthorne started spending hundreds of millions acquiring companies like General Hydroponics, a Santa Rosa-based indoor gardening supply company, to get into the marijuana industry s ancillary market  The move helped Hagedorn and his 39-year-old son, Chris, who runs Hawthorne,grab glossy magazine headlines, and Scotts  stock price started to rise In 2021, the company agreed to acquire more cannabis-focused companies like Luxx Lighting (purchased for $213 2 million in a deal closed in 2022), a grow-light company started by the founders of respected weed brand Jungle Boys, and brokered a $150 million convertible debt deal with Canadian cannabis investment vehicle RIV Capital  Scotts  stock bloomed to a robust $244 But thanks to themarijuana industry s prolonged recession driven by the oversupply of cannabis, a crashing wholesale price per pound of weed, a punitive federal tax code applied to cannabis companies, a lack of movement at the federal level to legalize marijuana andsales at Scotts dropping from $4 9 billion in 2021 to $3 5 billion in 2023, Scotts  share price cratered 75% from its high two years ago  Hawthorne, which saw its sales decrease by nearly 35% from 2022 to 2023 and posted at a net loss of $48 million for the year, had to terminate 1,000 employees from its 1,300-person staff, and shuttered Luxx Lighting after disposing of $200 million worth of unsold inventory in a landfill Hawthorne is now worth  zero, or less, says Hagedorn But they have a plan to spin out Hawthorne from Scotts, an announcement that helped the stock jump 8% in a day  Ultimately, the goal is tocreate the  Procter & Gamble of marijuana,  Hagedorn says, by selling Hawthorne to a publicly traded cannabis company WHY IT MATTERS  In 2015, Scotts Miracle-Gro CEO Jim Hagedorn was initially applauded for his vision and the market rewarded him as the company s stock reached an all-time high in 2021,  saysForbes staff writer Will Yakowicz  But like many people betting on cannabis a volatile industry that has been hamstrung by the U S  government s prohibition of the drug at the federal level the downturn hurt Scotts and its subsidiary Hawthorne  However, as the Drug Enforcement Administration ponders rescheduling marijuana,Scotts believes it can turn around its failed bet on
