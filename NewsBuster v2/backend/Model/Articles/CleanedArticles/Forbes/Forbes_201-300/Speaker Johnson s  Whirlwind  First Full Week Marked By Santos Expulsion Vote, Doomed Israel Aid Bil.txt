Senate Democrats  objection to the bill makes it essentially dead on arrival in the Senate, while President Joe Bidenthreatenedto veto the measure if it advances without additional aid for Ukraine.Government shutdown and Ukraine aid: On Wednesday, Johnson told Senate Republicans in his first address to the cohort that he plans to push for atemporary continuing resolutionto keep the federal government funded beyond November 17 deadline, but only through mid-January, a path that would once again postpone a set of appropriations bills for long-term funding after lawmakers narrowly averted a shutdown with an eleventh-hour stop-gap resolution on September 30.Johnson also expressed his support for foreign aid to Ukraine in his meeting with Senate Republicans, though he faces opposition from far-right Republicans who have demanded drastic budget cuts and a reduction in aid to Ukraine.The House has so farpassedseven appropriations bills   out of a necessary 12 in Congress  budgetary approval process   including two since Johnson took the gavel, voting in favor of a nearly $57 billion bill for energy and water projects with a nearly 5% cut over current spending levels, which the White Housethreatenedto veto.Santos expulsion vote: Johnson s first week was also highlighted by an expulsion vote against indicted first-term Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), who faces 23 federal charges, including fraud and money laundering, and has faced growing calls to resign (The House alsotableda vote to censure progressive Rep.

That infighting began on October 3, when a group of eight far-right Republicans joined all Democrats present in an unprecedented ousting of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), with members of the House Freedom Caucus arguing McCarthy failed to meet their demands for sweeping budget cuts.
