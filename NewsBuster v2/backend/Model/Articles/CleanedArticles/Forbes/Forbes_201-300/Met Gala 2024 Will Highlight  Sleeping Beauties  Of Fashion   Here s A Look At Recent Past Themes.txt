The pieces will span 400 years of history,accordingtoVogue, and will have a sustainability angle as it attempts to  enlighten our understanding of the natural world through the fashioning of dress and textiles.  The exhibit will also feature what the Met is calling  sleeping beauties,  or garments that aren t able to go on mannequins anymore  due to their extreme fragility.
