<figure><figcaption>Weed the People: With 70 percent of Americans now in favor of legalization, the DEA could play a major role in ending pot prohibition this year getty</figcaption></figure>Recreational cannabis is now legal in 24 states and five more could legalize adult-use sales this year  But will the DEA finally remove pot from the list of the world s most dangerous drugs?SinceOhio became the 24th state to legalize adult-use cannabislast November, the majority of Americans now live in a place where weed is legally available  And with the Biden Administration expected to complete its formal review of the scheduling of marijuana this year, 2024 is full of anticipation even though cannabis is still illegal under federal law Congressman Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), the co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, who will retire from politics at the end of this legislative session, believes there is a  productive year ahead  for possible major cannabis reform at the federal level  In my final year in Congress, and then in the talented hands of the 119th Congress Cannabis Caucus Co-Chairs, we will take bold action to end the failed war on drugs once and for all,  Blumenauer wrote in a memo published in early January   Despite dysfunction in Congress, we can accomplish significant reforms in cannabis in 2024  It is a commonsense issue that can bring people together rather than divide them  In December, Blumenauer co-sponsored Republican Representative David Joyce sStrengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States (STATES) Act, which, if passed, would remove state-legal marijuana as a Schedule I drug  The bi-partisan bill also tries to placate lawmakers who are not in favor of cannabis reform: the legislation would keep marijuana grown and produced outside of the licensed market illegal at the federal level, allowing states that do not want to legalize pot tokeep prohibition in place Currently, 24 states and Washington, D C , have legalized recreational use for adults 21 years and older, while 38 states have legal medical marijuana programs  Cannabidiol (CBD), another active ingredient in cannabis that is associated with some medical benefits but does not get users high, is federally legal and an additional 10 states passed laws to permit the use of products containing CBD and small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the compound found in marijuana responsible for getting people  stoned   That leaves only two states Idaho and Nebraska that do not allow for any kind of state-sanctioned marijuana use In one of themost significant steps toward cannabis law reform, President Biden announced in October 2022 that he wouldpardon all U S  citizens convicted of federal marijuana possessionand also asked the Department of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to review  expeditiously  how marijuana is scheduled under federal law  Currently, cannabis is classified as a Schedule 1 drug, a category reserved for narcotics (such as heroin or LSD) with a high potential for abuse and no medical value  In late August last year, HHS recommended that theDrug Enforcement Administration should recategorize marijuana as a Schedule IIIdrug, meaning it has a low to moderate potential for abuse  The decision is now in the hands of the DEA Andrew Freedman, the executive director of the Washington, D C -based nonprofit Coalition for Cannabis Policy, Education and Regulation, says the DEA is a  black box  and no one knows for sure what and when they will decide regarding a potential re-scheduling around marijuana  But the Biden Administration s view, Freedman says, is that the DEA will reveal its decision sometime during the  first two quarters  of 2024  I still have no reason to think it'll be anything but Schedule III,  says Freedman   But the big question will be how does litigation play out? If it is a long road of litigation, that's going to be tough does the rule survive two years of litigation, or a potential change of administration? Jaret Seiberg, an analyst and the managing director at TD Cowen s Washington Research Group, wrote in a January memo that  Washington will be busy this year with cannabis policy  but that the success of Biden s rescheduling effort  likely depends on President Biden winning a second term  Freedman notes that while a change in marijuana s scheduling would obviously be huge for the industry, it is  the least important policy question   While marijuana being categorized as a Schedule III drug, along with ketamine and anabolic steroids, would help, especially by removing thepunitive tax code plant-touching cannabis companies must pay under, it would not allow for interstate commerce  Without the ability for state-legal cannabis companies to ship products across state lines, the industry will continue to be  the redheaded stepchild of the economy  that cannot fully function Paul Armentano, deputy director of nonprofit marijuana legalization advocacy group NORML, says that while it is exciting to ponder changes at the federal level, 2024 will be defined by changes made in individual states  As in past years, I think the bulk of the legislative activity is going to take place on the state level,  says Armentano   We're going to continue to see lawmakers in states address issues surrounding both legal access and regulation, as well as a number of the ancillary issues that arise when a state legalizes cannabis, such as employment rights, facilitating expungement, strengthening parental rights, addressing issues surrounding whether or not the smell of marijuana constitutes probable cause for a search  As the 2024 Presidential Election gears up, most Americans now support legalization, and it is clear that cannabis reform is a  winning issue,  as Blumenauer describes it  And no matter who becomes the next president, five additional states could legalize recreational cannabis this year  Here s where the cannabis map could expand in 2024 Florida Home to the nation s largest medical market, advocates collected more signatures required to get a ballot measure put in front of voters, but the state s Attorney General has challenged the measure s language in court  Alegal battle is currently under wayand the outcome will decide whether Floridians will see a ballot measure in 2024 Hawaii In Hawaii, where medical marijuana is legal, Gov  Josh Green is on record in favor of legalizing adult use   I think that people already have moved past that culturally as a concern,  Green, a Democrat,saidduring a debate  The senate passed a bill that would legalize adult-use in 2023, but the House did not schedule a vote  In November 2023, Hawaii s attorney general, Anne Lopez,released a bill proposalthat would legalize adult-use sales if passed New HampshireGovernor Chris Sununuissued a statement in early May2023 about how he is  ready to sign  a bill with the  right policy  and  right framework   But in December, the Governor told a commission of legislators working on a legalization proposal thathe would veto any billunless it banned marijuana companies from lobbying the government and capped retail shops at 15 across the state  The commission ended 2023 without a bill proposal recommendation  New Hampshire is the only state in New England that has not legalized recreational marijuana PennsylvaniaMedical marijuana is legal in the Keystone State, and a bill to legalize adult-use wasintroduced last yearby two lawmakers, one Democrat and one Republican  Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, supports legalizing marijuana for people 21 and older  However, there is not enough Republican support in the state Senate for the bill to reach the floor for a vote,reports VirginiaIn 2021, Virginia legalized cannabis possession but lawmakers have been unable to pass additional legislation required to launch retail sales  There are high hopes for this year as Democrats now control both the state Senate and the House, although they have a slim majority and any bill could be vetoed by Governor Glenn Youngkin, a Republican MORE FROM FORBES
