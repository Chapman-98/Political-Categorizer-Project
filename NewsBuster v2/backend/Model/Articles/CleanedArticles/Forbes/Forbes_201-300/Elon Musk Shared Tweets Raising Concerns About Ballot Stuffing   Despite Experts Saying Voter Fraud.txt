That this happened here is beyond reasonable doubt,  Musk said in thetweet, referring to ballot stuffing, adding:  The only question is how common it is. In Connecticut, Superior Court Judge William Clark said surveillance footage showing a woman apparently putting multiple ballots into a ballot box was  shocking  and said  the volume of ballots so mishandled is such that it calls the result of the primary election into serious doubt, accordingto NBC Connecticut.Musk also linked to avideoposted by Trump spokesperson Liz Harrington on X   the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk bought last year   in which people are speculating a woman was stuffing ballots in Gwinnett County, Georgia, in 2020 and calling her a felon for turning in what appeared to be six ballots.The video shared by Musk does not appear to have been debunked by law enforcement, though at least three other videos in Gwinnett County that citizens had raised as potential voter fraudwere Â debunkedwhen investigators found the videos showed one person turning in ballots on behalf of family members, which islegalin the county.Even if the claims were not debunked and investigators found the ballots were harvested, Chairman of the Elections Board Matt Mashburn said the votes would have been legal under Georgia law and should be counted,accordingto theWashington Post.Forbeshas reached out to Musk for comment.Key BackgroundMany claims of voter fraud especially involving absentee ballots and ballot stuffing or harvesting have been debunked prior to and in the years following the 2020 election. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, there isextensive researchshowing voter fraud is  very rare, voter impersonation is virtually nonexistent  and many instances of alleged fraud are simply mistakes. For example, in 2017, the Centerfoundthe rate of voting fraud in the U.S. was less than 0.0009%. There is also research showing that there is no evidence absentee, or mail-in, ballots increase voter fraud,accordingto the Brookings Institute, and former President Donald Trump s claims of mail-in voter fraud have beenrejected by courts. In Georgia a state that was targeted by Trump s election fraud claims officials on both sides of the political aisle have maintained there wasn t  widespread  fraud. Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who served as Georgia s voting system implementation manager,saidin January 2021 that there was  no evidence of any irregularities,  and when they looked into potential incidents that were reported they found  nothing that seems real in any way, shape or form, honestly. Tangent Despite the data showing that voter fraud is increasingly rare and claims that the 2020 election was stolen being debunked, this isn t the first time Musk has promoted election interference theories. As recently as May, Musktweeteda link to astoryin  The Federalist,  a conservative online publication, alleging Mark Zuckerberg  bought  the 2020 presidential election by making large donations. X also receivedcriticismfor its handling of misinformation about the election, and politics more broadly, and not enforcing policies that allow platforms to restrict the spread of misinformation.Forbes Valuation ForbesestimatesMusk s net worth at $229.9 billion as of Thursday afternoon, making him the wealthiest person on Earth, largely due to his stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.Further Reading
