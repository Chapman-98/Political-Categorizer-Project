Crowdfunds Medical Expenses<figure><figcaption>ILLUSTRATION BY PHILIP SMITH FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE With his healthcare startup CrowdHealth, Andy Schoonover wants to destroy traditional health insurance by building a parallel system With CrowdHealth, members pay cash for their medical services, often way less than what insurers would have to pay after CrowdHealth negotiates on the member s behalf  And big bills are crowdfunded by other members CrowdHealth, born in Austin, Texas in 2021, is meant to be the antithesis of the typical insurance nightmare lean, efficient and, most of all, humane  In its short life, it s drummed up $12 million in funding, and, as of its last capital raise in 2022, flaunts a $30 million valuation The company has signed up 7,000 members, and they each pay $50 a month, so it s heading toward $4 million in annual revenue  The company isn t yet profitable, but Schoonover says he s confident it will be by this spring CrowdHealth is not insurance  For their $50 monthly payments, members get a team of personal bargain hunters  A third party hustles to slash their medical and prescription bills, often by 30%, just by knowing the true cost of medical care after backing out the insurance companies  cut and offering to pay providers quickly in cash  Schoonover says that most doctors are in favor of ditching the insurance middleman, but, he admits, not everyone s on board  7,000 members sounds like a lot, but in a health insurance context that s very small,  Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, tellsForbes   It would take just a few cases of bad luck with subscribers to overwhelm a model like this  CrowdHealth attaches a generosity score to all accounts, which tells everyone how much members pitched in  When members need funding, the crowd gets a peek at their score  It s a system built on give and take, counting onhuman nature to ensure that those who help others get helpin return Yet, the real hurdle lies ahead: convincing the masses that health insurance is a lost cause WHY IT MATTERS  Hate health insurance? You re not alone,  saysForbes reporter Brandon Kochkodin   Most  fixes  just fiddle with a busted system  CrowdHealth s different  It s old-school community care, the Amish have been doing it for generations, with a digital twist  Will it scale? Hard to say  But in a world where  innovation  often just means pricier premiums, isn t time for some outside-the-box thinking?
