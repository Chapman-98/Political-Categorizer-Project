STORYGoogle Training Gemini On Its Own Chips Reveals Another Of Its Advantages<figure><figcaption>Google unveiled its highly anticipated new AI model SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Google on Wednesday unveiled its highly anticipated new artificial intelligence model Gemini, an impressive piece of software that can solve math problems, understand images and audio, and mimic human reasoning But Gemini also reveals Google s unique advantage compared to other AI players: Google trained it on its own chips designed in-house,not the highly-coveted GPUs the rest of the industry is scrambling to stockpile As the AI arms race has heated up, GPUs, or graphics processing units, have become a powerful currency in Silicon Valley  The scrum has turned Nvidia, a company founded 30 years ago that was primarily known for gaming, into a trillion dollar behemoth  The White House has clamped down on chip exports to China, in an attempt to keep the AI prowess of a foreign adversary at bay But analysts say the fact that Google DeepMind, the tech giant s AI lab, trained its marquee AI model on custom silicon highlights a major advantage large companies have against upstarts, in an age where giants like Google and Microsoft are already under intense scrutiny for their market dominance Google s compute hardware is so effective it was able to produce the industry s most cutting edge model,apparently one-upping OpenAI s ChatGPT, which was largely built using Nvidia GPUs  Google claims that Gemini outperforms OpenAI

DeepMind, which had previously been notoriously distinct, in an attempt to give product development a push WHY IT MATTERS  Google s ability to train its AI model on its custom designed chips could eventually be a threat to big chipmakers such as Nvidia which has ballooned to a trillion dollar company as AI has become the hottest craze in Silicon Valley,  saysForbes senior writer Richard Nieva

companies have over upstarts, in an age where tech giants are already under the regulatory spotlight for their market dominance  MORE Google Tries To Straddle Being 'Bold' And 'Responsible' In AI
