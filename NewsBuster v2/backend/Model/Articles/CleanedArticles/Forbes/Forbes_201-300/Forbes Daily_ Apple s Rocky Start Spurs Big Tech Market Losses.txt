ByteDance appears to be hiring for at least 17 of these positions across New York, California and Washington state taking a swing at local rivals like Meta, Google and Amazon, where similar work is already underway.The AI for Drug Design team aims to  revolutionize drug discovery,  says one job listing recruiting Ph.D students to Silicon Valley. ByteDance s AI for Science group, meanwhile,  has been focusing on tackling challenges in natural sciences, including biology, physics, and materials,  say listings for research scientists in computational biology and quantum chemistry in Seattle. Staffers across the board will  co-create a future  with ByteDance, the listings say.What, exactly, that future is to be isn t clear. It is also unclear how drug discovery or development, and other science-focused efforts, fit into ByteDance s sprawling repertoire of social media sensations like TikTok and its Chinese counterpart Douyin.Forbesfound no indication that these ByteDance initiatives are related to TikTok, and TikTok did not respond to a request for comment about whether they are in any way linked.But experts said TikTok where many people are drawn to health and wellness content, talk openly about medical issues, and regularly seek information on what has (or hasn t) worked for others could serve as an invaluable feedback loop and marketing tool for drug developers.WHY IT MATTERS  This is not the first time ByteDance has ventured into industries that seemingly have little to do with TikTok, Douyin or social media but most of this expansion has been in and around China, and hardly at all in the U.S.,  saysForbessenior writer Alexandra Levine.  That s why this state-side push into healthcare and science seems to be an inflection point. It s also raising the stakes for ByteDance s biggest American rivals who are already moving into these spaces, edging into their territory and AI research talent pool. Still, it remains to be seen whether ByteDance or any other tech giant can actually beat the pharma/healthcare mainstays in these fields that are well outside their bread-and-butter social media and e-commerce businesses.
