Was there a central women s storyline to 2023? It s hard summarize the year with any neat narrative. January and February kicked off a rash of resignations fromprominent female leadersacross politics and business, but female power saw a resurgence over the summer thanks tothe dominance of Taylor Swift, Beyonce and,yes, Barbie. Women like Patti LaBelle and astronaut Peggy Whitson continued to prove through their work thatsuccess and innovation have no age limit, even asunthinking commentators suggestedthat anyone over the age of 50 is  past their prime.  Meanwhile, women working across economics, academia, sports, film and beyond broke records andcreated 27 new  firsts  for women this year.Of course, it wasn t unfettered progress and power for women: In a post-Roe America, abortion bans in more than a dozen statesrestricted access to essential healthcare, affected doctors  ability to treat pregnancy-related emergencies and,according to a poll of the nation s OB-GYNs, worsened pregnancy mortality rates. Pandemic-era federal funding for childcare ended in September,pushing the nation off the proverbial  childcare cliff and potentially forcing caregivers out of the workforce. Funding for female founderscontinues to lag (far, far behind)at homeand abroad. Suffice it to say: There s much work to be done in 2024.In the meantime, as we reflect back on 2023, these are some of the stories of entrepreneurial insight and malfeasance that captured our attention this year:Meet The World s Richest Self-Made Woman, by Giacomo Tognini<figure><figcaption>Rafaela Aponte-Diamant.AGENCY PEOPLE IMAGE/SIPA/NEWSCOM</figcaption></figure>Rafaela Aponte, a 78-year-old shipping mogul, and her husband Gianluigi saw their fortunes jump a combined $46 billion this past year.

How did Javice go from the Forbes Under 30 list to federal court?This , including what Javice used to tell those who had concerns about the ways she was exaggerating Frank s metrics in the earliest days of the company s existence.

Hennepin County eventually seized Tyler's condo and sold it for $40,000. But rather than keep the money it was owed and refund Tyler the remaining $25,000, the county kept the whole $40,000. And so, Tyler took Hennepin County to court and won.Startup Bobbie Proves There s Profit In Baby Formula Despite The Dominance Of Industry Giants, by Maggie McGrath<figure><figcaption>Bobbie cofounders Laura Modi, left, and Sarah HardyBobbie</figcaption></figure>Just 7% of venture-backed companies that disclose sales ever reach $100 million in revenue, and even fewer are headed by women. Bobbie managed it in a market that used to begin and end with Similac, Enfamil and Gerber Good Start.
