PatrickClaire's</figcaption></figure>For more than 60 years, Claire s has been a destination for the young and young at heart to find fun accessories to express themselves (and formany ear piercings)  Before Kristin Patrick joined the company two years ago, Claire s was focused on its store locations  Patrick, who was previously CMO for PepsiCo s global beverage brands, brought the accessories retailer a new digital presence, refocused the brand, and is forging new content partnerships  I talked with her about the Claire s brand and its path toward the future  This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity  Claire s has been around for generations  How do you keep that brand recognition strong, especially with so many recent changes?Patrick: Most people enter the brand during a rite of passage, which is a first piercing  In general, you experience it with something that is incredibly important to you, and you end up staying with the brand through generations  We re there for your proms and your graduations and your communions and your bar mitzvahs and your bat mitzvahs, whatever it may be We do work to make sure that we re constantly evolving the brand  When I joined the company about two years ago, it was a complete reboot from the top to the bottom  It entailed a rebranding  We ve been working on the store experience  We ve been opening new flagship stores  We have been working to put the brand in places where our consumers are  We took it out of its owned-and-operated stores and into other distribution channels  We created a game in the metaverse called ShimmerVille  I think it s a constant evolution, and at the center of it all is our product, and what we, what we pick and pluck in terms of trends What is different about Gen Z and Gen Alpha, your main marketing target demographics?Patrick:I lovingly refer to them as  the Zalphas   I think it s two of the coolest generations  They are incredibly creative, incredibly entrepreneurial  They morph their physical and digital worlds  They are very fluid in terms of the experiences that they want  They re fluid with their sexuality  They are very, very tech savvy, to the point where an Alpha will never have lived in a world without an Alexa  It is a very powerful group of consumers because they are harnessing social media and digital in a way that even millennials didn t  It is very much about giving them command and a say in what your brand is doing, and being able to kind of turn your platforms over to them in a way that most brands and marketers weren t really trained to do  It s a completely different way of communicating with them as well What are some of the things that you re doing to turn the platform over to them?Patrick: We created a five-part episodic series where we gathered kids together from all over the world, and we literally just let them talk  Frankly, we didn t know what the outcome was gonna be  We pulled them together  They talked about everything from family to friendships, to their bodies, body dysmorphia  They talked about some of the stresses in their lives  They talked about what makes them happy and what they do to feel confident  And we didn t step in, we didn t edit  We kind of just let them go  It s something that I really think is important, and we want to do more of that In addition, we have research feedback loops where we re constantly talking to them about what they re interested in, and what they think about Claire s, and what they think about their life and their generation  So we have a constant dialogue going on, and it s really important  We learn just as much from them, I think, as hopefully they re learning from us Tell me about your new partnerships with  and   Why are you entering these new spaces?Patrick: When we went along this new vision for the future, we talked to consumers and they told us a lot about Claire s and where we could go, and we sort of let them guide us  They told us,  We love the brand  We actually would like more from you   So it was things like,  We d love to get apparel to go along with the accessories    We d love for you guys to decorate our dorms and bedrooms  They told us that they wanted more content and information from us  They said that it could be as close in to things like giving advice around styling and fashion  They also said that it could be things related to the generation, and information around what other kids were interested in  And so we set up two partnerships, and we are going to start to tell stories  With Sony, we re developing a live action series, so think maybe the nextGossip Girl  For Audio Up, we re gonna be telling audio stories around Claire and who Claire is, and who Claire and her friends are and what they re doing In terms of messaging, there have been big changes for Claire s  Have there also been changes in what Claire s is and does?Patrick:We re thinking about Claire s as a brand and a lifestyle, right? We have our fleet of retail stores, we have our distribution around the world, and in other retailers as well  We ve got our e-commerce platforms, and there s a sort of  fourth pillar  around the brand and the brand lifestyle  I think that it s always gonna be about self-expression across all of the businesses  And it will always be about all of the things that people expect from Claire s, which is the fun  I think it s always about the treasure hunt and learning, and it s taking all of the equities of the brand and giving consumers new ways to experience it It s interesting because I don t think all retailers can do this, right? I think because Claire s has such a rich history, and there is a part of it that is so creative and imaginative  Because consumers said,  We will let you guys take us there  We ll go along with you on this journey if you wanna expand  What can we expect to see from Claire s in 2024?Patrick: What you ll see from us is more content coming out  I think that you re going to start to see a realness and an authenticity  More about the kids and their lives  I think that you re going to start to see some really interesting collaborations  We re still gonna continue to dabble in AI  I m really looking forward to a great year  This will be kind of the continuation of this rebranding  I think there's a lot more to come from us FACTS + COMMENTSAnew federal lawsuitbrought by a disgruntled consumer accuses the NFL and Fanatics ofillegally conspiring to squash competition for branded merchandise and drive up pricesof officially licensed items  Fanatics said this lawsuit is very similar to one previously decided in its favor, and the NFL did not respond toForbes request for comment 3%: Size of the NFL s stake in Fanatics, which it purchased for $95 million in 2017$31 billion: Valuation of Fanatics as of last month Share the monopoly profits among themselves : What the lawsuit says the NFL and Fanatics are doingVIDEO<figure><figcaption>YouTube</figcaption></figure>STRATEGIES + ADVICEBrand politics were pretty thorny in 2023, and that slikely to get worse this year  Here are someideas for navigating the landscape QUIZLucasfilm sued a car wash in Chile,claiming it plagiarized its business name  What is it called?A  Car WarsB  Dirt VaderC  Star WashD  Obi Wash KenobiSee if you got it righthere
