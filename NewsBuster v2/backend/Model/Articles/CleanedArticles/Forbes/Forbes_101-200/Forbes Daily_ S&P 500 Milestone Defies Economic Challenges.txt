Over the last two decades, King s Hawaiian revenue has risen 15-fold, and the modest family business has evolved into an acquisition-hungry home for emerging brands.Thesignature buns generate around 85% of the $900 million in annual revenue that Taira s food empire brings in the rest is from condiments and beverages with well over 40% gross profit margins, according toForbes estimates. It s an impressive haul for the food industry, where gross margins typically hover around 30%, especially considering the King s Hawaiian recipe calls for 12 key ingredients three times as many as other breads some of which the company will source only from the original suppliers in the Aloha State.Under the holding company Irresistible Foods Group, which was formed in 2021, the Taira family now sells Hawaiian-farmed tea and the classic bun complement: pickles. They ve also starÂ­ted a Hawaiian-inspired restaurant concept, all while remaining 100% family-owned.ForbesestimatesTaira s extended family which includes his 93-year-old mother, Tsuneko, who sits on the board alongside his four siblings is worth $2 billion.

The Tairas have been eying events like the Super Bowl they want  Slider Sunday  to be the new  Taco Tuesday  as well as grilling holidays like Fourth of July and Labor Day. Customers are buying rolls all year long: A decade ago, some 60% of annual sales came from Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year s. Now it s 40%. That shows staying power.
