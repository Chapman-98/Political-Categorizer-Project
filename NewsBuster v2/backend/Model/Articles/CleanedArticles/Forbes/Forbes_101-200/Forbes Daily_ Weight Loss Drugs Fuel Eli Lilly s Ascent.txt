Amazon, Walmart, Etsy and grocery delivery apps Instacart and Uber Eats may have unwittingly bought canned tomatoes and pastes produced by Uyghur forced laborersin China s far west region of Xinjiang, which are banned by the U S  government, according to aForbesreview of product listings Tomatoes and cotton grown in the region were banned by the U S  government starting in January 2021, and a new law barring all goods from Xinjiang kicked in from June 2022  The bans are a reaction to mass detention centers in the region, where Human Rights Watch say up to half a million people from the region s mostly Muslim minority group have been detained and forced to labor in farms and factories Since the 2022 ban was imposed under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act,U S  officials have seized more than $2 2 billion of goods at American ports they believed were produced by Uyghur forced labor Despite this,Forbesfound examples of canned tomatoes and pastes from Chinese companies with links to
