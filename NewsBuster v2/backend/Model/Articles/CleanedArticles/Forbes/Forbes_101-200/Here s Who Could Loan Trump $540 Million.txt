Most will say  I am not touching this guy   Trump does have plenty of assetsto put up as collateral, including 27 mortgage-free properties that are collectively worth over $1 1 billion  New York-registered banks he s worked with over the years, like UBS and the Bryn Mawr Trust Company, may still be skittish  Deutsche Bank, which was named in the attorney general s lawsuit, had already decidedto sever ties with Trump long before the judge s decision was announced  Given the growing reputational risk of doing business with Trump, I suspect he increasingly has to deal with relatively unconventional lenders, such as wealthy individuals, closely held financial firms and foreign entities not subject to U S  banking laws or regulation,  says Bert Ely, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives and principal of Ely & Co  Inc , a banking consultancy   Who they might be [is] anyone s guess  Evan Gotlob, a partner of the law firm Saul Ewing, is placing his bet on the Middle East and China   There are plenty of banks in the UAE, the new Wall Street, as well as in countries like Saudi Arabia  He also has close ties to China,  Gotlob notes   This does handcuff him, but doesn t cut off his legs  Even Wilbur Ross, Trump s former Secretary of Commerce, concurs, saying that he believes  foreign banks  will be happy to help Trump out   Deutsche Bank [was] a big lender to him in the old days,  says Ross, who himselflied for years about being a billionaire   There are plenty of banks  Trump has plenty of connections abroad  He has a newly mintedpartnership with a Saudi real estate firm and the government of Oman  His son-in-law Jared Kushner, meanwhile, has been cozying up to Saudi Arabia s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman  Kushner s nearly two-year-old private equity firmreportedlyreceived a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia s sovereign wealth fund  Of course, taking this path would raise fresh questions about his business partners and conflicts of interest right in the middle of an election, but that likely won t deter Trump, particularly given the hoops he d have to jump through at home There are still some options in the U S  Axos Bank is one obvious contender  The San Diego-based, largely online lender, which has $22 billion in assets, loaned Trump $225 millionin 2022 to refinance two real estate holdings, and its CEO, Gregory Garrabrants, donated to Trump s 2020 campaign  Axos did not respond toForbes  requests for comment on whether it would continue lending to Trump, though if the judge s ban on New York banks lending to Trump is reinstated, Axos wouldn t be affected, says Milana Dostanitch, a New York-based attorney at Lipsky Lowe LLP  The California entity for Axos Bank would not be chartered or registered with NYSDFS [New York State Department of Financial Services], which means Trump and his organizations are free to do business with them as well,  says Dostanitch   The judgment is narrowly drafted and does not appear to be broad enough to encompass the California business   Lending restrictions, though, limit Axos  lending to $301 million to any one borrower, meaning that it could only extend another $75 million to Trump Another domestic option might be Ladder Capital, a $5 5 billion real estate investment trust with three loans out to Trump right now on 40 Wall Street, Trump International Hotel and Tower and Trump Plaza, per the presidential candidate s latest financial disclosure  But Ladder Capital, which did not respond to a request for comment, did not finance either of Trump s most recent deals, at Trump Tower and Trump National Doral  It's unclear whether the firm, which has received plenty of scrutiny from its connections to Trump, would want to deepen its relationship with the former president If Trump can t find banks willing to move quickly enough, he can try to hit up wealthy investors and billionaire Republican megadonors who not only have cash, but an incentive to endear themselves to a potential future president  Trump certainly has his rich friends Take Phil Ruffin, a Las Vegas real estate tycoon and a longtime pal of Trump s  The two met in the 1990s and became fast friends   I went to Russia with him,  RuffintoldForbes in 2017   We took my airplane   Trump was Ruffin s best man in 2008 when he married his wife, Oleksandra, a former Miss Ukraine who is 47 years his junior  (He s now 88 ) Ruffin and Trump are also business partners  They developed the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, a golden glass tower on the Vegas Strip where they still co-own hundreds of condo units  Trump s half is worth $60 million, and Ruffin   himself a billionaire   could certainly afford to lend Trump money against his stake, or even buy him out  Ruffin did not respond to requests for comment Andrew Beal, a Texas-based banking billionaire worth an estimated $14 9 billion, is anotherlongtime Trump backerwho could step up  His Beal Financial Corp holding company controls two separate bank and thrift subsidiaries, Beal Bank USA (registered in Nevada) and Beal Bank, SSB (registered in Texas), either of which could lend to Trump, as could Beal himself  Beal declined to comment Then there is telecom billionaire Kenny Troutt, who, in addition to giving nearly $2 million to Trump presidential campaigns, was reportedly an early investor in Truth Social, Trump s social media site  Troutt did not respond toForbes  request for comment at press time Forbes reached out to more than 10 billionaires with ties to Trump, including Isaac Perlmutter,reportedlya former top adviser to Trump on the Department of Veterans Affairs, a Mar-a-Lago buddy andTrump Super PAC promoter; casino magnate Steve Wynn, a longtime Trump pal and donor; and Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur whomolded his bombastic far-right politics on Trump sand sometimes stumps for him on the campaign trail  Wynn and Ramaswamy had no comment, and the rest didn t reply toForbes  inquiry about whether they d lend money to Trump Truth Social is also another potential lifeline for Trump  Earlier this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission cleared the merger between Trump Media & Technology Group (Truth Social s holding company) and Digital World Acquisition Corp , a special purpose acquisition vehicle, after a long delay   He will be getting a billion dollars in stock from the SPAC,  predicts Wilbur Ross  (The shares are subject to a six-month lockup after the merger, though the company can waive the restriction )  Presumably that s collateral, in addition to his real estate  Ultimately, any institution or person who steps in to help Trump takes on a high degree of uncertainty   Any lender that makes a loan to Donald Trump, wherever they re regulated, has the potential of getting entwined in a dispute with this judgment,  says David Pratt, a Dallas-based partner focused on financial institutions at Bradley, a law firm  Trump has more experience dealing with complicated financial situations than probably anybody in the world,  says Ross, who worked to recapitalize one of Trump's Atlantic City casinos 27 years ago, before Trump named him commerce secretary   I would be very surprised if he weren t able to figure out a solution to this one  With reporting from Zach Everson and Luisa Kroll  MORE FROM
