ASPLEN/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINESince winning the World Series in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, the Los Angeles Dodgers have suffered a trio of disappointing playoff exits  This winter, theyshelled out nearly $1 1 billion on free agentsto ensure 2024 wouldn t result in a fourth But upgrading one of the most stacked rosters in baseball isn t easy and doesn t come cheap The Dodgers secured the two most-coveted free agents in baseball this winter, first with a record-breaking 10-year, $700 million deal with two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani the largest contract by total value in team sports history Two weeks after signing the 29-year-old two-time MVP, the Dodgers acquired another Japanese star: 25-year-old pitching ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto for $325 million over 12 years Because of that extraordinary spending spree, theDodgers now have the two highest-paid players in baseball this season Ohtani, whoForbesestimates will earn $62 million in 2024 (before taxes and agents  fees), claims the No  1 spot for the second consecutive season, while Yamamoto is No  2, with estimated total earnings of $59 million for the upcoming year But Ohtani who is embroiled in a gambling scandal after his former interpreter allegedly stole $4 5 million from him to cover illegal debts won t see a lot of that money this year  In a rare move, he chose to defer 97% of the $700 million owed to him, offering the Dodgers an opportunity to reinvest in more talent In total, baseball s ten highest-paid players are set to earn a record $462 million combined this year (before taxes and agents  fees), a 6% increase from 2023 s all-time high of $436 million  That figure continues to rise even as team spending declined dramatically year-over-year WHY IT MATTERS  Shohei Ohtani's robust endorsement earnings may offer him the flexibility to defer 97% of his yearly salary with the Dodgers, but baseball s nine other highest-paid players likely can t afford to make a similar sacrifice,  saysForbes staff writer Justin Birnbaum   If you remove Ohtani, theaverage off-field earnings among this year s listers is a paltry $2 3 millionannually, before taxes and agents  fees  But there s room for hope  Last year, sans Ohtani, that figure was roughly $1 5 million  MORE What Shohei Ohtani Can Learn From Tiger Woods And Kobe BryantFACTS AND COMMENTSAfter the death of owner Peter Angelos
