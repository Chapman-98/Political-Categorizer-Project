Congresswoman Victoria Spartz (R-IN) joined  Forbes Newsroom  to discuss her surprise 2024 reelection run, which came after initially declaring in 2023 she would not seek another term. Unfortunately, this Congress turned into really drama, and not a lot of things   are going to be delivered that I worked extremely hard on,  Spartz explained.  I felt that I need to give [my constituents] a choice of someone who actually would fight for them, not personal agenda. We have too many people in politics like that. Spartz noted that issues like border security and foreign policy are top of mind, and pointed out that she  was very disappointed  in the handling of both the Ukraine-Russia war and the Israel-Hamas war. The Indiana Republican accused the Biden Administration of  really not having a policy strategy that covers actions. Spartz also weighed in on former President Donald Trump s controversial remarks this weekend about NATO at a rally in South Carolina. Trump said he would encourage Russia  to do whatever the hell they want  if a NATO country did not pay its pledged share for the multinational defense alliance.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reportedly said that Trump s comments undermine the security of the United State and puts American troops  at increased risk.  But the Indiana Republican toldForbes she was not concerned about the former President s comments.  Ultimately, he s campaigning right now   I care more about what President Biden [does], and I ll hold him accountable. Watch the full conversation above.
