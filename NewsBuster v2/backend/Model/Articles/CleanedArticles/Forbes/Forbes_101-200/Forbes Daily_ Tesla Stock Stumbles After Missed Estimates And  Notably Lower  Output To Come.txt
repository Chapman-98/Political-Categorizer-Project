Aileen Lee Predicts More Women Will Found Unicorns Over The Next 10 Years<figure><figcaption>Aileen Lee, managing partner and cofounder of Cowboy VenturesMarlena Sloss/Bloomberg</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Back in 2013, when venture capitalist Aileen Lee first coined the term  unicorn,  just 39 companies qualified for the moniker That club has now grown to 532, according to Lee s latest research for her firm Cowboy Ventures,a 14X growth rate And when it comes to today s broader ecosystem of unicorns, startups whose valuations reached $1 billion or more over 10 years,in some ways it s more diverse than ever in sector focus, founder background and headquarter location  Enterprising people came up with all these new ways to use technology to help nurses and hospitals, or accountants, or farmers,  Lee says, noting that the list of 532 unicorns includes 19 sectors that Cowboy Ventures wasn t even tracking 10 years ago, including generative AI and enterprise marketplaces But in gender diversity, progress has been slow  Among the unicorns of 2013, there were no female CEOs and only 5% had a female founder or cofounder  Today, 14% of unicorns have a female cofounder and 5% have a founding CEO who identifies as female  The numbers have edged up, butthere are still more founders named Michael, David or Andrew among the present-day unicorn ecosystem than there are female CEOs, and Cowboy Ventures  analysis estimates that it will take until 2063 to reach fully equal gender representation WHY IT MATTERS There is ample evidence that showsinvestments made in female-founded companies are often a more lucrative financial movethan investing in male-founded companies   Especially in downturns, women and minorities have been kind of forced to be scrappier and to do more with less  So I think they will continue  to do so and also grow their ranks among the unicorn club s founders, she said MORE: Why Girls Who Code Founder Reshma
