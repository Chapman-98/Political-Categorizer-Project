crypto industry has long resisted having its tokens classified as securities  However, the success of bitcoin s spot ETFs, could prompt issuers to break ranks depending on the SEC s next move ILLUSTRATION BY ANGELICA ALZONA FOR FORBES VIA ADOBE FIREFLY</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Spring has come early to cryptoland  Bitcoin is trading above $60,000, up more than 167% in the last 12 months and more than $7 billion has poured into the new bitcoin ETFs The market is buzzing with anticipation foran ETF backed by bitcoin s little brother ether, the native token associated with the Ethereum blockchain and used to create such things as NFTs  Ether has a market cap of more than $400 billion, second only to Bitcoin, whose market cap exceeds $1 2 trillion  In May, the SEC will likely pass final judgment on nine spot ether ETF applications  But unlike bitcoin s decision day in early January, which seemed to be a fait accompli, ether s outlook is far less certain The most immediate concern iswhether the SEC believes that ether is a security, which means that it would be subject to registration and regulatory oversight by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940  Most ETFs, like the QQQ or the SPDR S&P 500 trust, fall under the so-called 40 Act, precisely because they are bundles of stocks, or registered securities Despite the fact that cryptocurrencies seem to trade and behave much like any number of stocks in the market, the digital asset community believes that the thousands of different cryptocurrencies behind the $1 8 trillion dollar industry are not securities  In fact, they bristle at the thought, calling it anathema to the decentralized ethos that launched bitcoin 15 years ago  To some extent, these beliefs were vindicated when the SEC greenlit spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January after a 10-plus year wait under the 1933 Securities Exchange Act, which recognized the underlying bitcoin in these funds as commodities WHY IT MATTERSIf the SEC decides that ether is a security, it will insist on ETF issuers treating it as such in their applications for approval  While this might seem like just a bunch of legal paperwork, doing so would be an affront to crypto industry insiders and idealists, and throw into question the status of thousands of cryptocurrencies  However, given the potential billions at stake for early movers in the new booming market for crypto ETFs, those that can gain market share rapidly as Blackrock, Invesco, Fidelity have with their bitcoin ETFs could benefit from such an SEC ruling  When it comes to asset gathering and profits,  crypto community ideals  aren t likely to carry much weight Said one applicant who requested anonymity,  At the end of the day, we'll file under whatever jurisdiction or regulation the SEC wants  MORE Crypto Billionaire Mike Novogratz On Bitcoin s Next Bull RunFACTS AND COMMENTSForbes 30 Under 30 alum Timothy Latimerannounced on Thursday new fundingfor

the more confusingwhen a role like that is reposted  Counterintuitively,this might be the right time to apply: Job listings get the largest volume of applicants within the first 48 hours, and this brief window tends to yield enough quality candidates for recruiters to move forward  But if a role is later reposted, it probably means no candidate was selected, and there may even be a greater
