They represent the biggest investing blunders committed by Davis Advisors, the family business he took over in 1998, which includes 17 mutual funds and ETFs,with total assets of $23 billion.Each certificate is accompanied by two or three sentences in small type describing what Davis calls  transferable lessons,  which mean, if heeded, that the errors won t happen again. Google is on the wall because Davis missed out buying into its 2004 IPO. Waste Management is up there, too, because Davis sold it during a management scandal in 2000, not realizing that its business was still humming. We have a humble culture,  he says.That doesn t mean Davis, 58, has nothing to brag about. His flagship$6.2 billion New York Venture Fund returned 30% last year, compared with 26% for the S&P 500 Index. The fund has delivered an 11.4% average annualized return since it began in 1969. The S&P: 10.2%But near-zero interest rates from 2008 to 2022 proved humbling to value investors and those not falling hard for large tech stocks. Davis  undervalued stocks stayed undervalued. Clients bailed. Venture Fund assets fell by 88%. Davis questioned his approach.With his unruly graying blonde hair, pullover sweater and-tie ensemble and an office decorated with what looks like a detonation of paper, a bust of Charlie Munger and a doggie bed for Knick, his 4-year-old Kooiker, Davis radiates the vibe of a philosophy professor more than that of a Wall Street power player. Davis Advisors is employee-owned;Davis  share is 30%, valued at around $100 million, and he has a significant stake in the firm s funds.But his grandfather and father dedicated most of their money to philanthropy, and Davis insists he is not a billionaire.WHY IT MATTERS FewWall Street pedigrees are as sterling as Davis . His grandfather, Shelby Cullom Davis, started trading in 1947 with $50,000 and turned it into $900 million, landing him on The Forbes 400 for eight years before his death in 1994. Under the stewardship of Davis  father, Shelby M.C. Davis, 86, the New York Venture Fund beat the market 16 times in 20 years and firm assets climbed to $3 billion by 1998.FACTS AND COMMENTSSongshave gotten more repetitive and angrier since the 1980s,according to a new study. They ve also gotten shorter, research has shown, and incentives from streaming services, people playing background music and the rise of short-form videos play a role:12,000: The number of English-language rap, pop, country, rock and R&B songs from 1980 to 2020 that were analyzedThree minutes: The average length of songs from the Billboard Hot 100, a decline from from four minutes in the 1990s, according to a report by theWashington Post24%:The share of Spotify listeners who skip a song in the first five secondsSTRATEGY AND SUCCESSConsumers who keep seeing headlines that inflation is improving mightwonder why they are still paying such high prices for everything. That s becauseprices are still increasing, just less quickly. Plus, it depends on what you re buying education and medical expenses have seen some of the biggest increases, for instance, while apparel has actually gotten cheaper.
