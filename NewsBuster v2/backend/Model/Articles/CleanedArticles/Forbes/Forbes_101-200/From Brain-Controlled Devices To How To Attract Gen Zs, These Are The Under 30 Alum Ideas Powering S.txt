He reached out to an existing investor who signed a terms sheet the very next day, which Ting says is the reason Evisort is here today. Life is really short, and there s a big dollar sign at the end of the rainbow, especially in AI,  he says, but he added that fostering and maintaining relationships with customers, investors and even competitors is the key to future success.Until next week,The U.S. Takes A Major Step Toward Banning TikTok<figure><figcaption>ILLUSTRATION BY FERNANDO CAPETO FOR FORBES; PHOTO BY ROBERTO WESTBROOK/TETRA IMAGES RF/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>Over the last two years, has revealedagain and again how deep TikTok's ties are to its Chinese parent company ByteDance   which remains beholden to the Chinese government   and how that could pose a risk to national security.

Since the boom of content creation, theForbes Under 30 list has recognized the individuals who have either built their businesses through social media or turned social media into their business. Hear from these entrepreneurs on what it takes to make it on the internet.Up this week: Taylor Cassidy, a 21-year-old2024 Under 30 Social Media listerwho is best known for her series Fast Black History, which teaches her 2.5 million followers on TikTok and Instagram about Black history in one minute or less. She s also received a special honor at the 2020 Streamy Awards for her other show focusing on Black creatives,Black Girl Magic Minute.The following has been slightly edited for length and clarity.Your content focuses on educating people about Black history. How did you get your start, and why is social media the best platform for this? My start posting videos online began when I was in 3rd grade. Around that same time is when I started to notice the difference in how I learned history at school versus at home. At home, Black people were triumphant heroes, royalty, inventors and rockstars, but at school they fell into a tight bottled category of enslaved. By the time I turned 17, I had a successful TikTok account with over 100k followers and two days left until Black History Month 2020. I created a 15-second video about Percy Julian, an incredible Black chemist, and called itFast Black History. The series went viral in a week.Even though I teach Black history online, I do not believe teaching it is best done on social media. It's best done in schools and in the classroom with a trained teacher. However, because laws continue to be implemented to block authentic, truthful teaching of Black history, social media is a place people flock to fill in the gap.People on the internet tend to have shorter attention spans. When trying to educate them on history, what s your strategy to keep them engaged?This has been simultaneously the hardest and most fun part of posting history videos online. Over the years, I've grown more creative in how to keep history enticing. My style in telling stories combines costumes, green screen and a comedy sketch format, but sometimes I need more to keep my audience's attention. I take what trends and viral music I'm interested in online and find ways to connect them back to history. For example, a few videos on my feed went viral comparing Doja Cat's appearance to the 1950s performer Dorothy Dandrige. I joined the trend, but instead of stopping the video at their appearances, I used it as a hook to reel the audience into a minute-long history of Dorothy and her influence on breaking barriers for Black performers.How often do you do brand partnerships? How do you choose who to collaborate with? I work with brands often as a creator and I've had the pleasure of learning over the years what works and doesn't work for me. The two pillars of who I work with comes down to how much they value authenticity and how our missions align. If the brand is coming to me with a message that aligns with what I already promote, it's a yes. If they have no clear understanding of my content and seem to only want me to focus on a product without going deeper, it's a no.You re also a radio host for SiriusXM s TikTok radio and a correspondent for Nickelodeon s Nick News. Tell me about how you got those gigs and why you chose to take them on.Both of these came from work I'd already done on my TikTok page. During 2020, as more and more dances choreographed by Black creators went profited off of but uncredited, I created a second web-series calledBlack Girl Magic Minute,where I uplifted and highlighted these creators, Black-owned businesses, followers, Black culture news and more in a talk show format. This series opened opportunities to hone my hosting skills with special guests like actor Jeremiah Birkett, creator of Healthy Roots Dolls Yelitsa Jean-Charles and designer June Ambrose. When TikTok Radio was created, they reached out to me to join their list of creators to guide listeners through trending music.In the same vein, Nick News reached out to me having seen my work onFast Black History. It was an immediate "yes" from me for two reasons. I wanted to be a part of the amazing mission of bringing real stories and education to kids just as I'd done online and I grew up loving shows likeReading Rainbowand remember how influential educational shows are for children. Plus, Levar Burton was my favorite TV host as a kid and I wanted to be like him.Where do you project the creator economy will be 10 years from now? Creators will be the new entertainment industry. With creators running their own channels, series and websites, we are our own production companies and hold all rights to decision making and showrunning. Ten years from now, we will be the new heads when it comes to what succeeds in the media. We've already seen what TikTok can do to politics, the music industry, and how it promotes creatives into success from one viral video. The more brands, networks and streaming companies pour resources into advertising through social media, creators will become the main resource they cannot afford to lose.What s your best piece of advice to aspiring content creators?Before offering creativity, which is a part of you, to the world, make sureyou enjoy it first. This way, you will have the drive, persistence and passion to protect it.
