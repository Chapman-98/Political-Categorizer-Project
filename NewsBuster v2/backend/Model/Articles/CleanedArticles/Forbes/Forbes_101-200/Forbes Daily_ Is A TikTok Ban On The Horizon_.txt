one of the biggestthreats to public health isn t a virus: it s misinformation Two months after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University reported that much of the discussion on Twitter of Covid-19 was disinformation driven by bot accounts It s not just Covid-19: By 2000, measles was officially eliminated from the U S  due to the introduction of a vaccine, but cases are surging as vaccination rates drop amidan onslaught of misinformation  Effective counter messaging from public health officials is key to rebuilding Americans

combat-readyand warned that any presence of U S  troops on Ukrainian soil will be viewed as an escalation  However,Putin said he did not believe that a military clash with the U S  was inevitable, and called President Joe Biden  a representative of the traditional political school  with administration officials who are in favor of  strategic restraint  Former PresidentDonald Trump won the GOP presidential nominationTuesday, according to the Associated Press, hours after Biden won his party s nomination making the2024 primary season one of the shortest in modern history  Republicans will

Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy subindexes, came in at 3 8%, above forecasts of 3 7% but still the lowest annualized core inflation reading since May 2021 Nonetheless,stocks rallied Tuesday, led by massive tech stocks, even as stickier-than-expected inflation could mean a delay in interest rate cuts  Tom Lee, head of research at boutique firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, hypothesized to CNBC that the market is discounting  the notion that overall inflation numbers  look worse than the reality of the economic situation One stock that continues to suffer is Boeing:Shares of the aerospace giant tanked again Tuesday, a decline that came after theNew York Times reported Boeing failed almost 40% of the Federal Aviation Administration s audits of its manufacturing process for the 737 Max commercial jet Boeing s stock is now down 29% this year, making it the second-worst performing company listed on the S&P 500, according to FactSet data, amid high-profile safety incidents MORE: Airlines also struggled Tuesday, withSouthwest Airlines  stock plummeting more than 14%after it said it willcut its flight capacity after receiving fewer Boeing jets than expected Meanwhile,American Airlines  stock dropped just under 5%after the company said it would have an adjusted loss at the low end of its prior guidance for the first quarter because of higher-than-expected fuel prices WEALTH + ENTREPRENEURSHIP<figure><figcaption>Barry Sternlicht (Photo by Craig Barritt/Getty Images for 1 Hotel Brooklyn

intends to combine with a group of hotels owned by Starwood Capital Group, a private real estate investment firm where Sternlicht is CEO and majority shareholder  There are no regulations preventing SPAC sponsors from merging with companies their beneficial owners also control,but this sort of deal is prone to conflicts of interest, says NYU Law Professor Michael Ohlrogge TECH + INNOVATIONFormerPresident Donald Trump discussed selling his social media siteTruth Social to Elon Musk last summer,theWashington Post reported, at the same time the company that planned to take the social network public faced an SEC investigation and regulatory pressure  The talks came before the SEC approved a proposed merger in February between Trump Media & Technology Group, the mostly Trump-owned company that owns Truth Social, and blank check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp MONEY + POLITICS The House of Representatives is expected to vote Wednesday on a bill that wouldforce Chinese tech firm ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a banin the United States  Thebill has received bipartisan support from unlikely allies,including President Joe Biden and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La )  But progressive Democrats may come out against it, and in a surprising reversal, former President Donald Trump has expressed opposition despite trying to ban the social media app during his presidency SPORTS + ENTERTAINMENT<figure><figcaption>Margot RobbieJOEL C RYAN/INVISION/AP</figcaption></figure>As Congress held a hearing Tuesday on the rise in non-consensual pornographic deepfakes,

models like ChatGPT and Gemini have ushered in a new age of AI in Silicon Valley, the world s most powerful tech companies are looking ahead to drug discovery and digital biology ILLUSTRATION BY ANGELICA ALZONA FOR FORBES; LAGUNA DESIGN/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE As language models like ChatGPT and Gemini have ushered in a new age of AI in Silicon Valley, the world s most powerful tech companies are looking to biotech as the next frontier in artificial intelligence At Nvidia, one of the few companies with a market cap in the trillions, the bulk of its venture capital investments over the past two years have been in drug discovery  At DeepMind, the Google AI lab s AlphaFold model a groundbreaking tool for predicting protein structures has been used by academic researchers over the past year to develop a  molecular  syringe to inject medicine directly into cells, and to research crops that are less dependent on pesticides While using AI in drug discovery is not exactly a new trend, executives at both DeepMind and Nvidia toldForbesthat this is a breakthrough moment,thanks to a confluence of three things: the mass of training data now available, the explosion of computing resources and advancements in AI algorithms AI has great potential in the biotech space because of its sheer complexity  Training AI models on hundreds of millions of different protein sequences and their underlying structures helps those models uncover patterns in biology without necessarily needing to do the expensive computations required by a true molecular dynamics simulation The boom in drug discovery tech isn t only coming from the AI tech giants  Since 2021, there have been 281 venture capital deals worldwide in AI drug discovery startups,accounting for $7 7 billion in investment,according to PitchBook Still, as promising and hyped as AI drug discovery is, there are setbacks  It still takes years to get drugs through clinical trials, and while the FDA so far has okayed clinical trials for over 100 new drug candidates that use AI or machine learning as a key development component, it has yet to actually approve one to enter the market  That s in part because the trial process itself often takes years to complete WHY IT MATTERS  When people think about the recent wave of innovation in AI, they re mostly thinking about the most controversial topics: using ChatGPT to cheat on exams, whether image generators are violating artist copyrights, making deepfakes to spread misinformation, things like that,  saysForbes senior editor Alex Knapp   But the major investments that tech companies are making into biopharma is one area where AI may have a real potential to be a technology for good If machine learning lives up to its promise of making drug discovery more efficient, that could mean better treatments at a lower cost than what s available now  MORE: This Startup Says It Can Beat Deepmind s Gamechanging Protein AIFACTS AND COMMENTSA new
