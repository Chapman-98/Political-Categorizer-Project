Finance LP</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Elon Musk ceded the title of world s richest person to Frenchman Bernard Arnault of luxury conglomerate LVMH on Tuesday evening, after a Delaware judge voided a hefty package of performance-based Tesla options awarded to Musk in 2018  Those shares had been worth more than $50 billion Forbes estimates that Musk is now worth $184 5 billion  He now trails Arnault, who is worth an estimated $210 8 billion, but remains ahead of the world s third richest person, Amazon s Jeff Bezos, worth $179 billion In her ruling, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick determined that Musk and his co-defendants, Tesla and certain members of its board, failed to prove that the process underlying the award of  the largest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets  was fair due to conflicts of interest and Musk s  control  over the board Musk s options were worth $50 9 billion (net of exercise cost) at Tuesday s stock market close  Because of the ruling, he won t be able to exercise or sell them  Given the high level of uncertainty about what comes next including an appeal of the ruling,Forbeshas discounted Musk s options by 50%,enough to knock his net worth down by $25 5 billion after the decision There is also the possibility that Tesla could just grant Musk another pay package with a more rigorous process designed to withstand legal scrutiny  After all, Tesla shareholders, whose stock has appreciated more than sevenfold since 2018, haven t exactly celebrated the decision by the Delaware court  Shares of Tesla were trading down 0 8% at 2:30 p m  EST on Wednesday Musk had been clamoring for even more Tesla shares prior to the Delaware decision  In an X post on January 15 he wrote,  I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control  If upheld on appeal, the judge's decision to void Musk's options pay package would drop his stake in Tesla from 22% to 13% WHY IT MATTERS  The Delaware judge s ruling to void $51 billion of Elon Musk s options caught many on Wall Street and in the legal world by surprise and cost Musk the title of world s richest person,  saysForbeswealth reporter Matt Durot   Musk recently suggested he might requiremore Tesla shares to stay with the company long-term, and the ruling does exactly the opposite  He s likely to appeal, and should he lose, Tesla will likely come up with another compensation package for him  Whether such an award could fully replace what was the  largest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets  is another question  FACTS AND COMMENTSGamblers inNevada spent more money at casinos in 2023 than any other year on record  Therecord-breaking year was buoyed by continued

people make a budget category like food, they often multiply their spending each week by four, but four weeks times 12 is only 48 weeks That leaves an entire month s worth of time unaccounted for Instead, try monitoring your spending weekly, or if you are going to track a whole month, multiply the weekly figure you re examining by four, then multiply it by 13 to gain an accurate sense of your
