Cyber Insurance Market<figure><figcaption>CODY PICKENS FOR FORBESCODY PICKENS FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Since 2017, fintech startups Coalition and its closest competi­tor, At-Bay, founded by security and spy-agency veterans, have beenreinventing the way cyber insurance is underwritten and managed, particularly for small and midsize clients Old-line insurers seemed hopelessly out of touch, sending prospective customers forms asking such basic questions as whether they had antivirus software installed  The newcomers, by contrast, scanned potential customers  systems as a hacker might  Sometimes they required specific security upgrades before agreeing to insure them  Other times, they simply turned them down That combination of screening, vigilance and jawboning has allowed the two fintechs to charge lower premiums, winning the favor of insurance brokers and a foothold in the market  It has helped, of course, that cyber was a newish niche when they entered the market, and that both cyber­attacks and demand for insurance against them exploded during the pandemic  Total cyber insurance premiums in the U S  shot from less than $1 billion in 2012to an estimated $11 billion in 2023, according to San Francisco-based analytics firm CyberCube Coalition CEO and cofounder Joshua Motta offers this chilling example: In 2020, using a single employee s login, a hacker was able to move laterally within a Kansas distillery s computer systems and shut the whole operation down   The gaskets that sealed the different equipment where fluid was being transpor­ted dried up and cracked,  causing property damage, Motta says Coalition and its reinsurers ultimately paid about $2 million on the company s claim, including nearly $1 million in lost revenue, $600,000 in ransom to get back online and fees for attorneys and digital forensics experts While neither startup is yet profitable, theirgrowth stands out in the struggling fintech sector,earning them spots on Forbes  2024 Fintech 50 honor roll WHY IT MATTERS Coalition retains just 10% of the risk and At-Bay keeps 20%  The rest of the risk and a big chunk of the premiums get passed on to large carriers and reinsurerssuch as Swiss Re and Munich Re  Net revenue last year was nearly $300 million at Coalition and more than $110 million at At-Bay Despite not making a profit, both companies still have money in the bank, but should they need to raise more capital soon, they d likely have to take a valuation cut given the state of the industry  Coalition last raised funds at a $5 billion valuation in 2022, making Motta s 20%-plus ownership stake worth a bit less than $1 billion, by our estimate MORE Eight CEOs Making Their Debut On The Fintech 50FACTS AND COMMENTSA proposed deal to builda new sports

four-day work week has been growing, asproponents cite benefits to well-being, productivity and morale  The main model for a four-day work week is 100:80:100, where employees are paid 100% of their salaries, work 80% of the previous hours but need to meet the same expectations for 100% performance  Critics of the shorter work week equate the amount of time spent working to working hard, when in
