Doesn t Need To Be First To Win<figure><figcaption>Yin Wu, CEO and cofounder of Pulley, a new Forbes Fintech 50 member, convinced the majority of startups in her class at YCombinator to sign up for her service CODY PICKENS FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE San Francisco-based Pulley, the most visible challenger to scandal-scarred Carta and a newcomer to this year s Forbes Fintech 50 list, is pouncing on the niche market for cap table management software Serial entrepreneur Yin Wu isn t at all intimidated by the fact that she entered the cap table game seven years after market leader Carta  She s gambling thatyou don t necessarily have to be first to win the long game  When Stripe was getting started, it wasn t the first payment processor  Braintree, Amazon Pay and Paypal all existed,  says Wu   But when you talked to folks that were actually using any of these payment networks, it wasn't like they had such an amazing experience on these platforms  It was more like,  well, this is kind of what exists   For now,Pulley still lives in the long shadow of Carta, which has 40,000 customers and was valued at $7 4 billion during its last fundraising round in August 2021 Pulley, for its part, has $50 million in funding from Stripe, Founders Fund and angel investors including Elad Gil, Jack Altman and Avichal Garg, Wu s husband, and the company notched a $250 million valuation in its Series B round in October 2022 ButWu insists Pulley s fundraising modeling technology is superior, helping founders understand exactly how much their stakes would be diluted by complex early-stage funding structures and what control they may be signing away should they offer to give away pro rata shares or  most favored nation  status to attract early investors  She also highlights Pulley s offer letter tool which seamlessly tracks equity grants to new hires on the cap table and facilitates the logistics of getting offers approved by the board and sending out option grants

(fair market valuations needed for tax purposes)  Many customers are on custom pricing plans for more advanced features Pulleyexpects to triple in revenue this year and bring in tens of millions of dollarsin 2024 WHY IT MATTERS  As venture-backed companies stay private for longer,serving their needs is becoming big business,  saysForbesstaff writer Hank Tucker   For more than a decade, Carta has been Silicon Valley startups  go-to option for tracking ownership, managing fundraising and granting equity to stakeholders, but thanks to Pulley s emergence, founders have more choices now  Yin Wu is
