So, under a pseudonym, he ventured onto X, yucking it up with folks looking to buy small businesses. He ended up leveraging his legal expertise to assist budding entrepreneurs.Pacifici s firm, SMB Law Group, has grown to 18 members, closing $1 billion in deals since opening its doors in 2022.Butselling a law firm isn t a walk in the park, and it s far from a guaranteed jackpot.Pacifici shed light on the problem in a February post, questioning why small law firms, even when they  print money,  attract few buyers.One obvious reason is  key man  risk.
