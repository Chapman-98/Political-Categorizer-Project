in full compliance with all of its U S  government contracts NurPhoto via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE A group of U S  lawmakers are calling on Elon Musk tomake SpaceX s Starshield military-specific satellite communications network available to American defense forces in Taiwan after years of refusing to do business in the country In a letter to Musk obtained byForbes, Rep  Mike Gallagher (R-WI) reminded the billionaire of SpaceX s contractual obligation to provide the U S  Department of Defense with  global access  to its satellite internet services  He noted that the Pentagon is committing  tens of millions of dollars  over the next year to Starshield, which uses low-Earth orbit satellites to provide communications and observational imagery to the military For Musk, the request is certain to discomfit  He has close ties with China, where Tesla has a major manufacturing plant, and has very publicly waded into the tensions the country has with self-governed Taiwan, which it views as part of its territory  In 2022, Musk suggested that tensions between Taipei and Beijing could be resolved if some control of Taiwan was handed over to China The letter also highlights theuncomfortable reliance the U S  government and military have developed on SpaceX s satellites  The Texas-based company has launched more than 5,000 satellites since 2019, and is the top vendor of satellite communications in the world  It is often the only way to get internet access in remote areas, places destroyed by natural disasters and war zones  The service has been crucial to Ukrainian forces battling a Russian invasion since 2022 After the original article was published byForbes,SpaceX said in a statement that it is in full compliance with all of its U S  government contracts  In addition, the company said it had notified the Select Committee last week that it was misinformed,  but the Committee chose to contact media before seeking additional information  WHY IT MATTERS It sunlikely the mercurial Musk can be cowed into activating Starshieldin Taiwan by lawmaker pressure  And he has limited Starlink access in disputed parts of Ukraine in the past because he said he does not want to be  explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation   But given the importance of SpaceX s military contracts with the U S  government, in Taiwan he may
