Forbes himself in 1918, with a net worth of $1 2 billion  By the time of his death in 1937, Rockefeller had given away the equivalent of $11 billion in current dollars, and left the rest to his heirs  Today more than 200 of them share an estimated $10 3 billion fortune That s enough to rank them No  42 onForbes first ever list of Decabillionaire dynasties  At a time when markets and asset values are soaring, and the number of billionaires seems to multiply by the day,Forbes decided to up the ante and rank only decabillionaire families worth $10 billion or more in our definitive ranking of the

billion in 2020have since lost their decabillionaire status  Among them: Purdue Pharma s Sackler family, whose offer to settle all OxyContin-related civil claims against them for $6 billion has been
