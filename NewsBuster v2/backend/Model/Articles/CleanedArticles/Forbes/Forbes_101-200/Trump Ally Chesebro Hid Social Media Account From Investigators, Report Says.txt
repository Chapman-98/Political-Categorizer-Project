ToplineKenneth Chesebro, the ex-attorney for former President Donald Trump, told investigators he did not have any social media presence or alternate IDs he used on social media, but aCNN investigation foundhe had a private Twitter account where he  promoted a far more aggressive election subversion strategy  than he shared with investigators   which could present new legal consequences for the attorney.<figure><figcaption>Kenneth Chesebro speaks to Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee during a hearing where Chesebro accepted a plea deal from the Fulton County District Atorney at the Fulton County Courthouse October 20, 2023 in Atlanta, Georgia.Getty Images</figcaption></figure>Key FactsChesebro a Trump lawyer who was involved increating a fake electors schemeallegedly designed to overturn the 2020 election results reportedly distanced himself from schemes to overturn the election when talking to investigators in Michigan, but didn t mention his alternate Twitter account on which he posted a number of things that contradicted what he told investigators, CNN exclusively reported Monday.Chesebro met with Michigan investigators due to his role in the fake elector scheme, which he has been considered the leader of after amemo revealedhe laid out the plan for GOP electors in six swing states to cast new ballots for Trump and send them to Washington for congressional certification.Chesebro told investigators he didn t use Twitter, but CNN linked him to the account  BadgerPundit,  which regularly tweeted about the electoral college process and how Trump could win a second term and Chesebro s lawyer confirmed to Forbes the account was his.AWordPress websitefor  BadgerPundit  on the WayBack Machine shows a picture of Trump and says that the pundit chronicles  farce, folly, and fiasco in progressive politics  and that his  work contains occasional hints of having progressed beyond a left-wing Wisconsin public high school education. Audio obtained by CNN indicated that Chesebro contradicted himself in his interview with investigators when he said he saw the alternate elector plan as a last resort, but the BadgerPundit page showed he was actuallytweetingdetails of how the plan could work even if Trump didn t win his legal battles.Manny Arora, a lawyer for Chesebro, told Forbes on Monday that when Chesebro was asked by investigators if he had  alternate IDs  he said no and believed he was answering the question honestly because he interpreted the question as an account  used during the representation of Trump,  but the BadgerPundit account was  just him pontificating his ideas out there. What We Dont KnowWhat consequences Chesebro might face. Chesebro doesn t face charges in Michigan, where he cooperated with law enforcement, but Adam Hoeflich, professor of legal ethics at Northwestern s Pritzker law school, told Forbes that Chesebro could face two issues if he lied about the existence of his profile. Hoeflich said Chesebro could have a  genuine legal ethics  issue with the Bar Association and may have risked his ability to practice law because  a lawyer is not permitted to make a false statement of material facts.  Hoeflich also said Chesebro could face a problem under Michigan law for  knowingly and willfully  making a false statement to an investigator, though he said it s up to the state whether it wants to use its time and resources to pursue charges. Forbes has reached out to the Michigan Attorney General s Office for comment.Crucial Quote  Trump doesn t have to get courts to declare him the winner of the vote. He just needs to convince Republican legislatures that the election was systematically rigged, but it s impossible to run it again, so they should appoint electors instead,  Chesebro said as BadgerPundit in 2020,accordingto the WayBack Machine. The tweet directly contradicted what Chesebro told investigators though, according to audioobtainedby CNN, when he said:  I saw no scenario where Pence could count any vote for any state because there hadn t been a court or a legislature in any state backing any of the alternate electors. Big Number 50. That s at least how many times Chesebro tweeted as BadgerPundit saying that Pence was able to count electors benefitting Trump, according to the CNN analysis of his account, which used the WayBack Machine.Key BackgroundChesebro is often considered the leader of the  fake electors  scheme to get Trump elected after he lost the 2020 election. He laid out a plan in a December 2020 memo reportedby the New York Times in which GOP electors in six swing states would cast new ballots for Trump and send them to Washington for congressional certification as though Trump had been elected. In the memo, Chesebro reportedlysaidhe was  not necessarily advising  the strategy be used, adding  there are many factors,  but he also wrote  it seems feasible that the Trump campaign can prevent Biden from amassing 270 electoral votes  during the certification. Chesebro has not been indicted in special counsel Jack Smith s case against Trump for election interference though he is believed to be an unnamed co-conspirator in the case. He was indicted andtook a plea dealin Fulton County s case against Trump and 18 others for election interference in Georgia. He has also spoken to investigators in Wisconsin and Arizona, CNNreported, and he was not charged in Nevada s investigation.Surprising Fact Chesebro s lawyers reportedly told CNN they should have  asked for clarity  when investigators asked him if he used Twitter, and said they have since  all the information on BadgerPundit  to states investigating claims in which Chesebro s involved.Further Reading
