GroupPHOTO BY CHRIS CRISMAN FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Clemens Food Group, one of America s largest pork producers now in its sixth generation of family ownership, has charted a more humane strategy that s at odds with the rest of the industry  And it s bringing home the bacon In 2023, California started enforcing Proposition 12, which legally bans farms from keeping pregnant hogs in crates barely larger than their bodies a practice that animal care expert Dr  Temple Grandin compares to forcing a person to spend months strapped in an airplane seat  (There are now 15 other states with some sort of crate law ) But competitors, including America s largest pork processor, Smithfield, have fought the new regulations, even shutting down plants rather than comply Those openingshelped double Clemens  market share last year, rising from 2% of the U S  fresh pork market to 5% and going from 1% of the bacon market to 2%  In all, 2023 revenue at the fifth-largest fresh pork producer in the U S  topped $2 billion Forbesestimates theClemens family is worth $1 1 billion The majority of that fortune comes from owning 94% of Clemens Food Group longtime employees and charities own the rest  The clan also owns $200 million worth of real estate around the East Coast In addition, Clemens owns a lot of its supply chain Every year, Clemens raises 2 7 million hogs, from an additional 110,000 sows that are raised by Clemens subsidiary Country View Farms  The rest of its annual 1 6 billion pounds of pork comes from a network of 20 family farms from Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and North Carolina That s givenClemens Food Group flexibility with its customers, which include McDonald s, U S  Foods, Sysco, Wegmans, Wendy s, Kraft, Publix, Target, Walmart and Jersey Mike

found that a pork consumer s bill would only increase $8 per year per person, because of the new measures WHY IT MATTERS  Meat is big business, andthere s a lot of money behind keeping standards extremely low,  saysForbes staff writer Chloe Sorvino   But consumers want their meat from animals raised more humanely, and better conditions usually means better meat to eat  Clemens is serving
