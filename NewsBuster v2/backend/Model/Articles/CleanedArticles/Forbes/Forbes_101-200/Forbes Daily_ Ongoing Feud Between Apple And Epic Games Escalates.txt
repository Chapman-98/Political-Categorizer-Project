Gates-Backed Startup Is Trying To Fix Steel s Horrible Environmental Impact<figure><figcaption>With a goal of lowering harmful greenhouse gasses in a vast and growing industry, Boston Metal has raised more than $350 million from investors Boston Metal</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Steel is the backbone of modern industry  It s in everything from cars and buildings, to kitchen appliances and medical equipment, and even your kid s braces  Our society is addicted to steel in a way that s unlikely to change anytime soon, but this ubiquitous alloy of iron and carbon also presents a conundrum:It s horrible for the environment Steel manufacturing is responsible for around 8% of global CO2 emissions, primarily because making it usually involves burning vast amounts of coal  If steel were a country, it would be the third largest polluter, says Donald Sadoway, a retired MIT professor and cofounder of Boston Metal  Sadoway thinks he s found a way to decarbonize the process by essentially shooting electricity into iron ore rather than splitting it with a chemical reaction in a blast furnace no coal needed With a goal of lowering harmful greenhouse gasses in a vast and growing industry,Boston Metal has raised more than $350 millionfrom investors that include steel giant ArcelorMittal and Bill Gates s Breakthrough Energy Ventures at a recent valuation, according to venture-capital database PitchBook, of $860 million Boston Metal already has a pilot plant at its headquarters just north of Boston, and this week it s slated to open a full-scale factory in Brazil that will produce pricey low-carbon iron alloys with cheaper off-the-shelf anodes, which are the high heat-resistant metal rods that conduct electricity  The idea is to quickly establish a solid source of revenue that will give the companyrunway to commercialize its green steel  Boston Metal CEO Tadeu Carneiro expects the Brazilian operation to reach $400 million in revenue, with $100 million in operating profit, by 2026 the same year it hopes to be commercial with its green steel WHY IT MATTERSHow much green steel will cost relative to traditional steelmaking is the big unknown  Steel is a commodity industry where every penny of cost counts  Irina Gorbounova, head of ArcelorMittal s XCarb Innovation Fund, concedes green steel will be pricey for a time   There s still what Bill Gates calls a green premium,  Gorbounova toldForbes But cofounder Sadoway has that bottom line in mind  He toldForbesthat as long as the plants that use its technology have access to  appropriately priced electricity,  the pricing should work   We want to make a better metal at a lower price without a subsidy,  he said   A premium means you failed  MORE Los Angeles Startup Uses AI To Reduce The Carbon
