DAILY COVER STORYRevenge Of The Bootstrapped Startup<figure><figcaption>Srinivas Njay, CEO and cofounder of interface aiCODY PICKENS FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE For five years, founders Srinivas Njay and Bruce Kim have been building interface ai and its artificial intelligence powered virtual assistant that helps banking customers complete tasks such as filling out a mortgage application and opening a new credit card  So far, they ve signed up more than 100 credit unions and small community banksserving 16 million consumers With AI in his company name and product, CEO Njay has been fielding a stream of calls from venture capitalists  He s happy to talk, he says, because at some point, the right investor might help scale up growth  I m just dating,   Njay says  We are in a good place, it's not like we need money   That s because Njay, 37, and CIO Kim, 59, have been able to get their company to this point with just $1 million of their own savings, a $3 million credit line from TMCC, an Indian credit union run by Njay s father and crucially bybootstrapping growth using internally generated revenue It s not just fintech, either  Other industries such as direct-to-consumer ecommerce have already gone through the process of discovering thatthe winners aren t always those with investors throwing money at thembefore they even have any sales  People are finally converting to the religion of profitability,  crows Mike Salguro, who launched meat delivery service ButcherBox in 2015 with $10,000 of savings and a kickstarter campaign offering pre-sales of his premium cuts  While food box services with big VC dollars behind them have struggled, ButcherBox has been profitable since its first year And Simple Modern, which sells sleekly designed water bottles and other utilitarian products, has become a major success via bootstrapping it made $40 million in profit on $200 million in 2023 sales  It s not just that CEO Mike Beckham doesn t need money from VCs It s a matter of autonomy, he says Says Beckham:  We stayed bootstrapped because we really felt like we weren't going to be able to run the type of company that we wanted to run if we took outside capital, that the demands of the shareholders or their interests might conflict with some of the things that we wanted to do, especially when it came to giving money away [via donations]  WHY IT MATTERS U S  venture firms raised just $67 billion in 2023, the lowest haul since 2017 and down 61% from 2022  Yes, the VCs are still chasing deals in AI and have plenty of uncommitted funds  But the continued weakness in the market for initial public offerings since 2021 s record (and poor-performing) crop, is dragging down private market valuations and limiting what VCs consider worth
