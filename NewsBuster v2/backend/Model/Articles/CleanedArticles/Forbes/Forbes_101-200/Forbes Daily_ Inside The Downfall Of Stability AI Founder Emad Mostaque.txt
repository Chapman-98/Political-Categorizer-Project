well-heeled clients in his iconic red-soled heels, shoe designer Christian Louboutin is now a billionaire SHAYAN ASGHARNIA/AUGUST</figcaption></figure>After four decades of keeping his well-heeled clients in his iconic red-soled heels, shoe designerChristian Louboutin is now a billionaire  While still best-known for its towering stilettos and perilous platforms, the Louboutin brand has expanded into sneakers, bags and beauty products, as well as lines for men and children The company was valued at $3 2 billion last year by Exor, the investment company of Italy s Agnelli family, which bought a 24% stake in 2021 for about $650 million  Louboutin still owns 35% whichForbesvalues at $1 1 billion  That stake makes up most of an estimated $1 2 billion fortune that includes other investments such as the Vermelho Hotel, a luxury resort he opened in southern Portugal last year  I started the company with my two best friends,  Louboutin said in a 2021 interview withThe Business Of Fashion   I never thought of selling a part of the company  I never thought of anything else other than designing pretty shoes  Those pretty shoes which start at about $800 a pairand can quickly reach into the mid-thousands  have become a fixture on the red carpet  And today, Louboutin has more than 160 boutiques in 32 countries across 4 continents, including 35 in the United States, 23 in Japan and 20 in China The company produces more than 1 million pairs of shoes a year and as with many luxury fashion brands, the high prices are key to its staying power  But after posting record profits during the pandemic, the luxury goods industry saw slower growth in 2023 Shoes were the slowest-growing luxury category last year, expanding by only 2% to 3%, according to Bain & Company  That s impacted Louboutin, too  The firm recorded net profits of $37 million in the first half of 2023, down 51% from the same period in 2022, amid raw material shortages and slow growth in China But Louboutin is not ready to put his feet up just yet WHY IT MATTERS Even as he s moved beyond heels into sneakers and makeup,Louboutin himself remains essential to the brand s success  He designs the autumn and winter collections at his French ch√¢teau or in Portugal, and works on the spring and summer collections in Egypt or Brazil  The sketches are then manufactured into shoes at factories in Italy and Spain   I
