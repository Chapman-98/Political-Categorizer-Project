My morning usually starts between 6:30 and 7:00am, when my toddler gets up and I can hear him talking to himself  He just started a Montessori school, so I just get him ready for school and make him breakfast  Then I try to wait a good couple minutes before I check my phone in the morning, but I ultimately have to check my phone to see if I've got any emails  After that, I have breakfast and coffee and sometimes do a quick workout  I'm not a huge workout person, but I'll do a 15 minute class or I'll do jump rope Has becoming a mother changed your career a lot?It has, and it was actually a lot more impactful than I thought it was going to be  I was like,  Oh, I can do that  You're just taking care of a baby   But it s been sort of a shocking transition, just in terms of the physicality that it takes and the emotional toll that it takes  But luckily I built a team around me  I found an amazing nanny, I set my company up for success so I could take proper paid leave and my husband stayed home and did some paternity leave, too  We also moved out of New York City to Miami, which is something I never thought I d do Whether in your career or in your life would you say is your biggest inspiration? I would say my mom  She had her own marketing agency in the eighties through the two thousands, It was a female founded company with a whole female team  I d go there after school and do work in her conference room, and so I was surrounded by phones and people on the computer and everything, and so that, through osmosis, affected me  I think it gave me the confidence and inspiration to be able to do the work that I do What would you say is your biggest accomplishment to date?Writing a book  Writing a book is a beast  It is so much work, and doing that while running a company was even harder  And I only gave myself a six month timeline to finish it, so I'm really proud of that What is something that you cannot live without?I can't live without my AirPods  I use them for work, but I also love listening to music constantly  And I also listen to podcasts What is something that you think will change the comms industry in the next year or three years? AI, definitely  I think that everybody's scared of it, but my team and I actually embrace it  We created a whole program around it in our operations manual for it to help us think of ideas, come up with pitches and write press releases  You can never sort of submit that final product to a client, but it can help with that idea creation What is your favorite social media or digital app right now? I think that it's always been Headspace  It puts me to sleep with its soundscapes and it wakes me up with the morning breathing, so I love it What is the best piece of advice that you've ever received?It s something my dad always says, which is  healthy body, healthy mind   I'm a big proponent of mental health and that's really important to me  I actually was diagnosed with OCD late in life, and so I really started focusing on keeping my body healthy through exercise, through sleep, through therapy, and that all helps my mind, too  Whenever I'm stuck at work or feeling a little anxious or uncomfortable, I get up and I go on a walk or run, and it literally always makes me feel better
