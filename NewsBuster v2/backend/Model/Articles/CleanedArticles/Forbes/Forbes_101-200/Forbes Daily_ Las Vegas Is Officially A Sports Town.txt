returning to his position as Disney CEO in late 2022, Bob Iger held a meeting with two top executives to talk about video games  It s a sector the company had mostly avoided since 2016, when it shut down the Disney Interactive Studios division that was, at one point, losing some $200 million per year  But Iger s aides came armed with demographics and other statistical trendsshowing that gaming had become too popular to ignore  When I saw Gen Z and Gen Alpha and even millennials, and I saw the amount of time they were spending in terms of their total media screen time on video games, it was stunning to me, equal to what they spend on TV and movies,  Iger said on Disney s earnings call on February 7 That same day,Disney announced its big move the company would invest $1 5 billion into

universe or TV series in the future The new partnership, however,suggests much more than an IP exchange  Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, estimated to be worth $4 1 billion, said in a statement the plan is to  build a persistent, open and interoperable ecosystem that will bring together the Disney and Fortnite communities  WHY IT MATTERS  They are the kings of passive entertainment, and they're very good at parks, butthey've been less successful with interactive,  says Jason Chapman, founder and managing partner of gaming investment firm Konvoy Ventures, of Disney   These worlds, if done successfully, could produce a heck of a lot more reusable entertainment and engagement and monetization mechanics than a movie  So I think it's probably a really good investment for Disney, which
