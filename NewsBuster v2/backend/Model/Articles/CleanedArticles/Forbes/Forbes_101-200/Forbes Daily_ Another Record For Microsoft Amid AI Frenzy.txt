STORYSingapore Airlines Bets Big On India<figure><figcaption>Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon PhongMUNSTER CHEONG FOR FORBES ASIA</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Singapore Airlines has plenty to brag about: record profits, nearly full planes, a coveted Best Airline award  But the subject that really excites CEO Goh Choon Phong is India Singapore Airlines didn t fare well during the pandemic due to the country s small population and a vastly reduced market for domestic travel, but a deal giving it a 25 1% stake in Air India is expected to close in March  Goh plans to make the country a hub in effect, a second home for the airline with almost unlimited room for growth India is a valuable prize for SIA  It is Asia s last big and largely untapped market, with China largely shut off to outsiders and Indonesia relatively mature (dominated by big players such as Lion and Garuda)  No other air market in Asia or even few in the world offers the same potential Goh, who has been CEO since 2011, proved his chops as a leader who can plan long-term during the pandemic  Goh asked his biggest shareholder, Singapore state-owned Temasek Holdings, and other investors, to inject $11 3 billion in U S  dollars in fresh capital into the airline SIA used the funds toprepare the airline for its post-pandemic future by expanding and sprucing up its fleet  All this preparation meant that when air travel restrictions were lifted at the end of the pandemic, SIA could immediately take to the air with flights packed to capacity from pent-up demand And last June,SIA was named the World s Best Airlineby U K -based airline consultancy Skytrax, toppling Qatar Airways, which held the top accolade since 2019 WHY IT MATTERS Last year, over 327 million Indian passengers were expected to take domestic and international flights, up 73% from the previous year, according to Statista  As India s economy keeps growing, so will air travel, andSIA is now poised to grab a significant chunk of that
