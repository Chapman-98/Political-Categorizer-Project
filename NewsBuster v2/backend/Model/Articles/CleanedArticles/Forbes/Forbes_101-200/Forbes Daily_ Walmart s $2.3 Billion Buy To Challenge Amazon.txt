Baggage fees, including charges for checked bags and overweight items, are part of an income category that helps airlines offset the rising cost of fuel.Baggage fees aren t the only extras: Seat fees may now earn just as much ancillary revenue for airlines, as more charge for premium seating.Let s get into the headlines,BREAKING NEWS<figure><figcaption>Amazon will join the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday.

DAILY COVER STORYElectric Cars Vs. Wildflowers: Who Wins?<figure><figcaption>Moral Miner: For buckwheat and batteries to coexist, Ioneer must be  the embodiment of responsible mining,  says Chairman James Calaway, shown in his Houston office.TREVOR PAULHUS FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE In 2017, Bernard Rowe and James Calaway secured enough mineral rights in Nevada s Esmeralda County to potentially produce more than 100,000 tons of lithium a year enough to makebatteries for billions of iPhones and millions of electric cars.Now Rowe, an exploration geologist and CEO of Australian mining company Ioneer, and Calaway, a Texan who had developed one of the world s biggest lithium mines, just need to start digging.Rhyolite Ridge, a volcanic rock outcrop in the southwest part of Nevada, is on federal land, requiring permits from the Department of the Interior s Bureau of Land Management. But given China s dominance in lithium, Calaway, Ioneer s chairman, believed his project would be favored politically.There was a complication: a 6-inch-high desert wildflower with yellow blooms called Tiehm s buckwheat.The heart of this rare perennial s 900-acre range is right where Ioneer intended to mine. So the comÂ­pany worked with desert botanists to devise a plan to dig up and  translocate  thousands of plants to similar terrain nearby.Calaway didn t get the chance to try. After 40% of the native population, about 17,000 plants, died mysteriously in the summer of 2020,environmentalists petitioned for its inclusion as an endangered species. Undeterred, Ioneer submitted revised mining plans in early 2022. Months later, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service officially designated Tiehm s buckwheat as endangered.Calaway s desert bloom dilemma exposes a critical challenge facing policymakers. Who prevails in green vs. green,when one environmental concern comes into conflict with another? Is digging up enough minerals like lithium, neodymium and dysprosium to enable the electric vehicle transition worth killing 44,000 small plants growing in the middle of the Nevada desert? Should we erect offshore wind turbines if they kill whales and seabirds? If so, how many dead whales is too many?If the Bureau of Land Management gives the nod to Rhyolite Ridge (a decision is expected by mid-2024), it would be the first new mine on federal lands approved under the Biden Administration. Ioneer hopes to begin producing lithium by the end of 2026.WHY IT MATTERS  This deal matters a lot, because in order to achieve any kind of green electrification transition without relying on raw materials from China, theU.S. needs more domestic sources of lithium and other battery metals,  says Forbes senior editor Chris Helman.  If Ioneer can prove that such development can simultaneously protect an endangered species, it could smooth the path for similar projects.
