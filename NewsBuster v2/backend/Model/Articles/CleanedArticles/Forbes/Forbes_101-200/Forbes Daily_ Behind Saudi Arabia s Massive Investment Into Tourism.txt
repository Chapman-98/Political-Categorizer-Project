TheMiddle East kingdom is on a massive building spree creating private islands, luxury hotels, theme parks, cruise ports, and even a desert ski resort. The question remains: If they build it, who will come?TRENDS + EXPLAINERSWhile former President Trump is likely to appeal the $83.3 million verdict in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, should that ruling hold,the irony of the U.S. tax codeis such that Trump could probablydeduct most or all of the payment as a business expense, while Carroll would have to pay taxes on all of it. All punitive damages are taxable as ordinary income, including the portion that goes directly to lawyers, but even the compensatory damages are taxed in cases of emotional distress.DAILY COVER STORYExposing The Myth Of Decentralization<figure><figcaption>Aragon s story illustrates that decentralization of finance and governance might be nothing more than a utopian pipe dream.ILLUSTRATION BY ANGELICA ALZONA FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE For a decade now, the crypto industry has beenselling the promise of decentralization, a new financial system without middlemen, but the story of the Aragon network token (ANT) shows that idea might be nothing more than a pipe dream.Those who held the ANT cryptocurrency were told last Novemberthey were being cashed out of their investments, like it or not. The Aragon Association that issued the tokens unilaterally decided to put its assets beyond the reach of corporate activists a very centralized move for an organization considered a standard-bearer for decentralized finance. Fearing investors could eventually control more than 50% of the votes, the association offered a take-it-or-leave-it buyout of 0.0025376 ether, about $5.76, and holders have 12 months until November of this year to cash in.The deal will see at least $11 million and possibly much more go to a successor not-for-profit company set up by Aragon. Aragon did not respond to requests for comment, but there may yet be more to the story disgruntled ANT holders managed to get hold of $300,000in Aragon s decentralized autonomous organization andhave used it to retain a law firmto potentially oppose Aragon s strategy. That firm, Patagon Management, did not respond to requests for comment, but posted to X,  It is in our opinion papered over, beautified theft. WHY IT MATTERS If all of this seems like the height of 1980s corporate raider culture on Wall Street,that s because it is. Decentralization is  what you have to do if you are in crypto to attract new investors and get more legitimacy,  says Camila Russo, founder of decentralized finance-focused publication The Defiant.Much of the cryptocurrency business just mimics what already exists in traditional finance, but with an alluring high-tech narrative.  [Decentralized finance] has evolved in a much more centralized way than expected,  Russo says.MORE: Why DeFi s Woes May Be ExistentialFACTS AND COMMENTSRemote workers should be awareof the potential increased risk of layoffs andtake proactive measures to ensure their job security, as they contend with less visibility in the workplace and manager bias.35%: Increased likelihood that professionals working from home will be let go, compared to onsite employees67%: Share of remote employees who report that the stress about layoffs has affected their productivityOne step ahead: Show your supervisor and company that you are plugged in and attuned to the big picture despite being offsiteSTRATEGY AND SUCCESSThe Golden Bacheloraside, sex and the senior citizen is considered a story about decline.
