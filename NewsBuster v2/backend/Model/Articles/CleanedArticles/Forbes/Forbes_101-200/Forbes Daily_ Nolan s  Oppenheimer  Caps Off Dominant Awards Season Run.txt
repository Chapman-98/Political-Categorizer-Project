Rather than liquidate his shares to cover the debt, Breslow had allowed $30 million to be swept from Bolt s bank account, the lawsuit alleged. And when three board members insisted he repay the company, he forced them out instead.These problems were an ocean away in Ibiza, Spain, where Breslow was headlining a mindfulness retreat centered around dance and  the pursuit of happiness.  But back home, the suit was among a host oflegal battles, bitter money squabbles and shaky venturesthat awaited him.Over the past two years, Breslow has repeatedly attempted to use his Bolt equity to take out large loans, and has tried to expense seven-figure travel and security bills to Bolt after stepping down as CEO, according to internal documents, court filings, and interviews with more than a dozen friends, advisors and colleagues.Breslow declined to comment on a detailed list of questions sent byForbessaying they contained  too much inaccuracy.  However, his October 2023 motion to dismiss a lawsuit by Activant, the aggrieved Bolt shareholder,confirmed the $30 million loan s existenceand terms, as well as his non-repayment at the time. Bolt declined to comment.WHY IT MATTERS For years,Breslow had personified Silicon Valley successwith an archetypal story: a public school kid who dropped out of Stanford University to found Bolt, a one-click payments company that became a venture capital darling and raised $1 billion in funding, earning him a spot onForbes list of theworld s youngest billionairesand a cover story. By early 2022, Wall Street heavyweights like BlackRock and H.I.G. Growth had lined up to back a $355 million Series E funding round, valuing Bolt at $11 billion and Breslow s personal stake at over $2 billion.But instead of catapulting Bolt to new heights, the 2022 deal marked the start of a turbulent 18-month period for Breslow, pocked with acrimonious lawsuits and a showdown with one of Bolt s earliest backers.MORE Inside Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt s $1 Billion Philanthropic MessFACTS AND COMMENTSSingapore was theonly stop in Southeast Asia for Taylor Swift s globetrotting Eras tour, a privilege its government paid for, and the city-state s economic growth projections for 2024 areseeing a boost as a result, according to Bloomberg:2.5%: Annual GDP growth projection for Singapore this year, up from the 2.3% that had been predictedOver 50,000: Number of attendees at each of Swift s six concerts in the country$225 to $300 million: Amount added to Singapore s economy in Q1 from foreign tourists attending Swift s concertsSTRATEGY AND SUCCESSHave you filed your taxes yet?If not, you re in good company, the IRS says the number of returns it has received so faris slightly behind this pointlast year.
