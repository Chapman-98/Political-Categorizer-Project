The longtime prosecutor was tasked with leading two separate inquiries: A probe into the January 6 riot and efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, and an investigation into Trump s handling of classified materials. Former Vice President Mike Pence was also subpoenaed by Smith earlier this year, but Pence isplanning to fightcomplying with the subpoena. Both probes have accelerated in recent months, possibly putting Trump closer to legal jeopardy than any other former president in recent memory.What To Watch ForTheTimes reported last monththat Smith could make his first charging decisions this summer. Prosecutors will likely start with charges in the relatively straightforward classified documents case rather than the complex and politically perilous January 6 case, the paper reported. But Trump could face more immediate legal exposure in Georgia, where a state prosecutor has suggested charging decisions are  imminent  in an investigation into Trump s efforts to overturn that state s election results.TangentKushner and Ivanka Trump s testimony to the House January 6 committee drew widespread attention last year when excerpts were played during the panel s televised hearings. Notably, Ivanka Trump told lawmakers she  accepted  former Attorney General William Barr s belief that the 2020 election wasn t marred by voter fraud, contradicting her father s false voter fraud claims. The former presidentpublicly insistedon social media his daughter hadn t assessed any voter fraud evidence and had  long since checked out. Surprising FactIt s unclear how closely tied Ivanka Trump and Kushner are to the former president s political operation. After Trump announced a 2024 presidential run last year, his daughtersaid in a statementshe no longer plans to be  involved in politics,  pledging to  prioritize my young children  and support her father  outside the political arena.
