legal team requested the meeting, according to CNN Federal prosecutors are reportedly weighing whether to charge Hunter Biden with two misdemeanors for failing to file taxes in 2016 and 2017, one felony count of tax evasion and another charge for making a false statement on a questionnaire required to purchase a gun Federal investigators believed in October they had gathered enough evidence to charge the younger Biden in the long-running case, and sent their findings to the U S  Attorney s Office in Delaware, theWashington Post reported, citing sources familiar with the matter but it s unclear whether prosecutors will charge him The case is one of several investigations that have enveloped the president s son: On Tuesday, a judge overseeing a paternity dispute involving one of Hunter Biden s children ordered he appear in person before the court next week, while congressional Republicans are avidly investigating whether the president influenced his son s business dealings Key BackgroundThe 2018 case before the U S  Attorney s Office in Delaware stems from an investigation into Hunter Biden s foreign business dealings and expanded to include a probe into his taxes and purchase of a  38 revolver  Hunter Biden was using cocaine at the time of the gun purchase which he has discussed openly and failed to disclose his drug use on a questionnaire required to buy the firearm  Separately, Republicans in the House have ramped up their probes into whether the president had contact with his son s Ukrainian business partners while serving as vice president though the president has fervently denied any involvement with Hunter Biden s financial dealings and insisted he hasn t discussed business with his son  The allegations reached a fever pitch just before the 2020 presidential election, when theNew York Postreportedthe contents of a laptop it said belonged to Hunter Biden suggested that then Vice President Joe Biden met an executive from Ukrainian energy company Burisma at the behest of his son while Hunter Biden was serving on the board of the company  In an entirely separate matter, Hunter Biden is embroiled in an ongoing child-support dispute with an Arkansas woman with whom he fathered a 4-year-old daughter Surprising FactSome federal investigators working on the Hunter Biden case are reportedly growing wary of the pace of the investigation and have suggested politics have influenced prosecutors  decisions in the case  A supervisor with the Internal Revenue Service who is involved in the Justice Department probe into Hunter Biden s taxes claimed in a letter to Congress earlier this month that the agency has mishandled the investigation, and suggested that Hunter Biden has been given  preferential treatment   FBI officials have also expressed frustration that the case has yet to reach an inflection point,NBC reported last week, citing senior law enforcement sources who said they finished the majority of their work a year ago  Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee, has said he s stayed out of the probe to avoid a potential conflict and has left Delaware U S  Attorney David Weiss, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, to oversee the matter TangentHunter Biden s legal team has taken a new, aggressive approach to combating the various allegations against him as his father gears up for a reelection campaign  On Monday, his legal team asked the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate Rep  Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga ) for her inflammatory rhetoric about the president s son, including her allegations that he is involved in human trafficking  In a separate Monday letter, his attorney Abbe Lowell also asked the Treasury Department Inspector General to probe how Garrett Ziegler, a former Trump White House official, obtained  suspicious activity reports  from Hunter Biden s bank that he published on his Marco Polo website dedicated to exposing various individuals he claims are involved in  corruption and blackmail   Last month, his lawyersfiled a lawsuitlast month against the owner of the laptop repair store that distributed the contents of his computer, alleging
