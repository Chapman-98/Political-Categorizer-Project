Sadr and his allies have refused to engage with other Shia groups in the parliament backed by Iran, delaying the formation of a new government in the country. Tehran is an influential playerin Iraq s national politics and it backs a bloc of political parties led by former prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki a rival of Sadr. Sadr-loyalists fear that his exit from active politics could allow Iran-backed leaders to seize power in a new ruling coalition. Aside from political parties, Iran also exerts influence over several Iraqi paramilitaries who are part of the country s security forces but not directly controlled by the government in Baghdad, theNew York Timesreports. Iraq s caretaker Prime Minister an ally of Sadr has decried the violence and also imposed a nationwide curfew. Sadr himself has demanded an end to all violence across the country and said he will go on a hunger strike until this happens.Crucial QuoteIn astatementissued on Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad which is located inside the Green Zone said:  The United States is concerned about escalating tensions and urges all parties to remain peaceful and refrain from acts that could lead to a cycle of violence...Now is the time for dialogue to resolve differences, not through confrontation.

In July, Iraqproduced4.496 million barrels per day and a major drop in that number could send global crude oil prices soaring further.According toReuters, there has been no disruption in oil exports from Iraq as of Tuesday, but Sadr s supporters have surrounded a refinery in Basrah, which produces 210,000 barrels per day. Despite this, the global benchmark Brent Crude Oil Futures Index is down more than 2.4% on Tuesday morning amid fears of an oncoming recession.TangentA series of what appears to be unrelated rocket attacks on a gas field in northern Iraq s Kurdish region forced U.S. workers to leave the area, causing another disruption in the country s energy sector, Reutersreported.
