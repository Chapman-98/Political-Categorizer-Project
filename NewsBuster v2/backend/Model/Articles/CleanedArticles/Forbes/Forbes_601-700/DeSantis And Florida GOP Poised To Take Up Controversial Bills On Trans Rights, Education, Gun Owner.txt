What To Watch ForThe legislative session will last for 60 days and end in early May, with DeSantis widely expected to launch his 2024 bid sometime after the session ends. The governor has promised the legislative session will be  the most productive session we ve had  for pushing his administration s agenda ahead of his anticipated presidential run.What We Don t KnowWhat other controversial bills may be filed. TheNew York Timesnotesmore legislation is likely to be filed later in the session, as that allows lawmakers to have more time to prepare bills and less time to debate them before they re up for a vote. It s particularly expected Republican lawmakers could introduce new restrictions on abortion after previously enacting a 15-week ban in the state, though it s still not clear yet how far such a ban would go. It also still remains to be seen how many of the bills that have been introduced will actually pass, and not all of them have been explicitly endorsed by DeSantis, such as the restrictions on bloggers.Crucial Quote I ve never seen a governor in my lifetime with this much absolute control of the agenda in Tallahassee as Ron DeSantis,  Florida lobbyist and DeSantis supporter Brian BallardtoldtheTampa Bay Times.Chief CriticsMany of the proposed bills for Florida s legislative session have already drawn widespread criticism even before the session has officially begun. The American Association of University Professors hasdenouncedthe higher education bill, saying it  would destroy academic freedom, tenure, shared governance and university independence in the state s public higher education system,  for instance, and anti-gun violence organization Giffordsdecriedthe permitless carry bill as  dangerous legislation that will drive gun violence up and further jeopardize the safety of our families and communities.  First Amendment Foundation executive director Bobby Block told theabout the defamation bill:  This is about intimidating free speech, chilling free speech and silencing critics. TangentAnothercontroversial billthat s been introduced, but faces far longer odds of passing, would completely abolish the Democratic Party in Florida and require the state s 4.9 million registered Democrats to be unaffiliated or register with a different party, by directing state officials to eliminate any political party that  has previously advocated for, or been in support of, slavery or involuntary servitude.  State Sen. Blaise Ingoglia (R), who introduced what s called the  Ultimate Cancel Act,  said he had drafted the bill without any involvement from DeSantis, and the governor has not endorsed the legislation.Key BackgroundThe new legislative session adds on to a string of controversial actions DeSantis and the Republican-controlled legislature have taken, as the governor has sought to institute so-called  anti-woke  policies that have often drawn criticism. The state garnered national attention for the Don t Say Gay  bill, for instance, which sparked a battle with Disney that resulted in the governorpenalizing the companyfor opposing the policy and appointinghis own boardto oversee the special district that controls Walt Disney World. Florida has also restrictedclassroom librariesand publiclyrejecteda proposed new AP African-American Studies course for having a  political agenda,  in addition to other controversial measures, like the state s 15-week abortion ban. The controversial policies have raised DeSantis  national political profile, and while he s drawn widespread criticism from the left, he won reelection in November by a 19-point margin and is widely viewed as former President Donald Trump s primary rival in the 2024 GOP primary. The start of the legislative session comes as DeSantis has been trying to make more of a name for himself nationally over the past few weeks,releasing a bookthat touts  Florida s blueprint for America s survival  andmakingÂ appearancesacross the country.Further ReadingIn Florida Legislative Session, a Chance for DeSantis to Check Off His Wish List(New York Times)DeSantis  sway over Florida Legislature unprecedented ahead of 2024 bid(Tampa Bay Times)Florida bills would ban gender studies, limit trans pronouns, erode tenure(Washington Post)Republicans In Florida Are Trying To Get Rid Of The Democratic Party(Forbes)'Disaster for free speech': Florida defamation, libel bill alarms advocates(Tallahassee Democrat)
