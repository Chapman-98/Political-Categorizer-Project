STORYEffective Altruism-Linked Group Used Millions Donated By FTX To Buy A Czech Castle<figure><figcaption>Last July, an effective altruism-linked group received $4 5 million from FTX to fund the purchase of a Czech castle called Chateau Hostacov FEDERICO WINER/ULTRADISTANCIA FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Just months before its collapse, FTX donated millions of dollars to an obscure charity for a real estate investment: the purchase ofa centuries-old castle in the scenic Czech highlands  That $4 5 million gift is one of dozens of donations from the FTX Foundation, the exchange s philanthropic arm, now tied up insprawling bankruptcy proceedings The funds were disbursed last July to the European Summer Program on Rationality, a Czech educational non-profitwith ties to  effective altruism, a social movement promoted by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried  Effective altruism is a philosophy that seeks to do the most good for as many people as possible  As Bankman-Friedonce said:  I wanted to get rich not because I like money, but because I wanted to give that money to charity   (A few months later,he toldtheWall Street Journalthat his charitable efforts were  as much PR as anything else  )Chateau Hostacov was built in 1297, converted to a 17-room hotel in 2007 (featuring a restaurant, pool, escape room and frisbee golf course), and was sought after by the Czech non-profit as an events venue  But for now, the castle s future, and all donations to FTX grantees remain in limbo WHY IT MATTERS FTX management is seeking to reclaim a chunk of the company's assets as the landmark bankruptcy case continues to unfold  Donations, including political campaign contributions, have already been targeted, but millions of dollars distributed by the FTX Foundation hang
