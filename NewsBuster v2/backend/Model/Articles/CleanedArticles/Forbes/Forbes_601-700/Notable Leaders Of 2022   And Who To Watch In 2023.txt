<figure><figcaption>Climate change activist Greta Thunberg, who turns 21 today, ended the year on a high note thanks to misogynist troll Andrew TateGetty Images</figcaption></figure>Here s an excerpt from this week s CxO newsletter. To get it to your inbox, .Thanks to readers who suggested some additions to our2022 list of notable career crashes. Among the ones who stood out:Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his titles and royal duties amid sexual abuse allegations in January, directorDavid O. Russell, whose filmAmsterdamwas a box office flop, and misogynist trollAndrew Tate, who was humiliated byGreta Thunbergon Twitter last week and then arrested for alleged sex trafficking in Romania.Another contender for career-damaging moves in 2022 is soccer legendCristiano Ronaldo, whose ignominious split with Manchester United was followed by a ho-hum performance for Portugal in the World Cup. While his move to Saudi Arabia s Al-Nassr football club may be good for his wallet, few think it s likely to boost his reputation.Also, we were remiss to mention the former U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss without noting that she came to power after scandals forced her predecessorBoris Johnsonto resign. On the international politics front, Chinese leaderXi Jinpingfaced widespread protests amid Covid lockdowns and Russian PresidentVladimir Putin will likely go down as the biggest loser of 2022, along with the bevy of billionaires who rely on his largesse.Notable Leaders Of 2022With darts come laurels, so let s take a moment to celebrate those who inspired us in 2022. As with career crashes, we decided to bypass the volatile and polarized realm of U.S. politics. Voters will pick the winners or lobsters, and investigators will determine if the contents of Hunter Biden s laptop, Donald Trump s taxes and George Santos  resume warrant further action.

Whether his heroic status will continue into 2023 remains to be seen. While he has vowed to continue fighting Putin, Zelensky also signed a new media law last month that gives his government broad censorship powers that move Ukraine closer to its rival in terms of press freedom. That s not a good look for a leader who is trying to win the hearts and minds of supporters in fighting for freedom.The war in Ukraine also showcased the steady leadership of European Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyen. From managing a $300 billion+ budget to negotiating consensus with 27 heads of state who represent 450 million people, von der Leyen earned her spot atopForbes  list of the World s Most Powerful Women.The Year In Sports: <figure><figcaption>Argentina's Lionel MessiGetty Images</figcaption></figure>The first nod goes toLionel Messi, who led Argentina to a World Cup victory that he celebrated with the most-liked Instagram post ever.

In baseball,Aaron Judge set an American League record by hitting 62 home runs for the New York Yankees.Meanwhile, legendary Steelers quarterbackBen Roethlisberger left the game while rivalsTom BradyandAaron Rodgers continue to defy what we thought we knew about the lifespan of NFL athletes with awe-inspiring performances. Serena Williamsretired from a legendary career in tennis to build on her success as an entrepreneur. Right behind her, inspiring a new generation, isNaomi Osaka, the highest-paid female athlete of the year.(In terms of money, it s still a man s world as our annual list of highest-paid athletes confirms.) Behind every great player, of course, is a great coach. Here are contributor Steve Silverman s choices in the NFL and accolades from Tom Layberger. I leave it to sports fans to debate the rest but not without first recognizing Brian Flores for bringing attention to racism in hiring coaches with his NFL lawsuit.Entertainment Winners: <figure><figcaption>Taylor Swift dominated the Billboard charts and continued to rewrite the rules of music, though TicketMaster snafus left some fans unhappyGetty Images</figcaption></figure>Taylor Swiftbecame the first artist to occupy every spot on Billboard s top ten singles.Forbes  30 Under 30 alumJack Harlow saw his single  First Class  debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart andEuphoriapropelled fellow Under 30 alumZendayaon to the charts, too.Jennifer Hudsonbecame the youngest woman to ever earn an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.

(And I d give a shout-out toCodaactor and Oscar winnerTroy Kotsur for inspiring us on multiple levels with his humor and talent.) And while others will decide who wins best director accolades during awards season,James Cameron deserves kudos for creating a technically ambitious film inAvatar: The Way Of Water. It s also earned more than $1.37 billion globally, putting it within striking distance of being one of the highest-grossing films of all time.Peter Jackson became the third person in history, afterSteven SpielbergandGeorge Lucas, to become a billionaire by making movies.In TV, it was a great year forTheWhite LotusstarJennifer Coolidge,Stranger Things Sadie Sink,Jeremy Allen WhiteofThe Bear, andAbbott Elementary creatorQuinta Brunson.The Year of The Worker: <figure><figcaption>As AI becomes ubiquitous and creative Joy Buolamwini's warnings about algorithmic bias are being heardGetty Images</figcaption></figure>2022 was a year where workers got more leverage.Derrick Palmer andChris Smallshelped form Amazon s first labor union a move that rippled through corporate America. California State Sen.Monique Limón(D) helped lead the charge among legislators around the country in passing pay transparency legislation that will make it easier to spot and address discrimination. Computer scientistsTimnit Gebru andJoy Buolamwinishowed us that algorithmic bias is real.
