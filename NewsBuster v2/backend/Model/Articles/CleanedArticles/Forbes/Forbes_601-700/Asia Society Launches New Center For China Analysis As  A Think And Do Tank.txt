One,  he continued,  is that it's important to bring together the full spectrum of China's specialization under one roof in order to bring together the best integrated analysis of contemporary China that is possible   There is no lack of analysis on different aspects of China's rise  What I find    is a lack of synthesis in drawing the threads of disparate analysis together into an integrated whole that can make sense to policymakers,  Rudd said  That is why the Center for China Analysis will bring together expertise on Chinese domestic politics, China's domestic economy, new developments in Chinese society and culture, rapid advances in Chinese technology, as well as the most recent developments in Chinese foreign security policy, and of course, China's impact on climate,  Rudd said  In the minds of the Chinese leadership, all these things relate to each other  Therefore, I think it's useful for other international leaders to have available to them integrated analysis of Chinese politics and policy in a way that also relates the part to the whole,  he said Second, Rudd continued, the new center will attach a priority to Chinese-language sources   Many of the debates on China's foreign and domestic policy are well ventilated by China's own domestic discourse, often freely available in its own public literature, assuming of course you know where to find it (and) assuming you'll put in the effort to read the Chinese original sources  We therefore intend to make maximum use of Chinese domestic journals, publications, newspapers, and online information as the Chinese system itself seeks to communicate across the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people new directions in politics, the economy and foreign policy   That's not to say we'll believe everything that we read, but it's important to understand how the Chinese system speaks to itself  It's what we describe in the CCA as our  inside-outside  angle of looking at China,  he said Another feature of the Center for China Analysis is  vigorously objective analysis of where China is going that  will be critical of Chinese policy whenever necessary, but also means to bring a critical approach to bear on U S  policy, where we also judge that to be necessary  <figure><figcaption>Xi Jinping, China's then vice president, left, speaks as Kevin Rudd, Australia's then prime minister, looks on during the Australia China Trade and Economic Forum lunch, at Parliament House, in Canberra, Australia, on Monday, June 21, 2010  Photographer: Ian Waldie/BloombergÂ© 2010 Bloomberg Finance LP</figcaption></figure>Event speakers and panelists included former U S  Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, as well as Wu Guoguang, senior research scholar at the Stanford Center on China s Economy and Institutions; Chris Johnson, president of political risk consultancy China Strategies Group; Ma Guonan, a senior fellow on the Chinese economy at the Asia Society Policy Institute; Evan Medeiros, former top Asia advisor to President Barack Obama and current Asia studies scholar at Georgetown University; and Rorry Daniels, managing director of the Asia Society Policy Institute Other panelists included Dr  Selwyn Vickers, CEO of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK); Dr  Bob Li, MSK Physician Ambassador to China and Asia-Pacific; and Kate Logan, associate director of climate the Asia Society Policy Institute  Guest attendees included business leaders Joe Tsai and Ray Dalio See related posts:China Party Congress To Highlight Trade-Offs As Growth Slows   Top Obama Asia Policy Advisor Says U S  Cancer Moonshot Needs Strong International Effort To Make Substantial Progress   Kevin RuddBiden Deserves Credit For Taking On Cancer:  Cancer Moonshot PathwaysTop Chinese American Group Blasts  Racist Slurs  By Trump About His Former Transportation SecretaryU S -China Business Ties Are  Better Than The Headlines @rflannerychina
