Just in the past week, Musk has used his Twitter account toattackthe country s top infectious disease official Dr. Anthony Fauci and make references to theQAnon conspiracy theory. Musk s comments appear to be having a direct impact on the perception of Tesla as a brand, a Morning Consultpollfrom last month showed. The electric-car maker s favorability among Democrats dropped to 10.4% from 24.8% in October while it rose from 20% to 26.5% among Republicans.
