ToplineFormer President Donald Trump became the first former or sitting president to beindictedon criminal charges Thursday, but while polling conducted in the leadup to the indictment suggests most Americans believe the charges against him are serious and fair, the development is unlikely to hurt and could help Trump as he vies for the GOP presidential nomination <figure><figcaption>Former

have shown Trump increasing his standing among Republicans for the 2024 presidential nomination, further widening his lead over Florida Gov  Ron DeSantis Half of GOP voters support Trump in 2024, a Harvard CAPS/Harrispollfound up four points from February while Trump s lead over DeSantis had doubled since February, going up from 43% support to 54% support, a recent Fox Newspollfound Similarly, Morning Consult sweekly tracking pollfound 52% of GOP voters support Trump, which is consistent with the level of support he s received throughout March, though the share of Republicans who have a favorable view of him decreased slightly from March 19, from 57% support to 55% But 57% of respondents in a Quinnipiac poll conducted March 23-27 believe the charges against Trump should disqualify him from running for president again, and 55% said the charges were very or somewhat serious even as a 62% majority believed the Manhattan district attorney s case against Trump was more motivated by politics than the law A 56% majority believe investigations into Trump are fair and not a  witch hunt,  an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Maristpollfound, and 46% believe he s done something illegal A further 29% believe Trump has  done something unethical, but not illegal  in regards to investigations into him including 43% of Republicans while only 23% believe the ex-president has done nothing wrong Big Number61%  That s the share of NPR/PBS/Marist poll respondents who do not want Trump to be president again, including 21% of Republicans and 64% of Independents, while 38% of U S  adults do  Besides Republicans, the only demographics in which a majority support Trump becoming president again are Trump 2020 voters (81% want him to be president again), residents of small towns (52%) and white evangelical Christians (55%) though Marist notes support among that demographic has dropped from where it was in the past  White men without a college degree were evenly split 50/50 on whether or not Trump should return to the White House What We Don t KnowHow public opinion will change now that Trump s actually been indicted  The charges against Trump still remain under seal, which may have an impact on the public s view of the case and the seriousness of the crimes he s facing, and the reality of him being indicted rather than it just being a likely possibility could move the needle  It s still unclear whatTrump s arraignmentin Manhattan, expected on Tuesday, will look like whether he ll do a  perp walk  and appear in handcuffs, which his attorney hassuggestedwon t be the case but Trump has reportedly said he wants to make the event a  spectacle  that will project defiance, which could further inflame his GOP base and garner support for him Surprising FactTrump s indictment and even a convictioncan t stop himfrom heading back to the White House if voters elect him, as there s nothing in the Constitution that prevents people who have been charged with or convicted of a crime from serving as president unless they re impeached and removed from office Key BackgroundTrump wasindicted in ManhattanThursday on charges stemming from $130,000 in  hush money  payments made in 2016 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, which he allegedly reimbursed ex-attorney Michael Cohen for and mislabeled as being for  legal expenses   While the charges against him remain under seal, he s reportedly been indicted on more than 30 counts related to business fraud, and is believed to face charges for falsifying business records  That can be a felony in New York if done to cover up another crime, and be punishable by up to four years in prison  While the Manhattan DA s investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization has been ongoing since 2019, and theNew York Timesreportedthe investigation had turned its attention back to the Daniels payments in November, Trump facing imminent charges has been a major source of speculation for only the past few weeks, as the grand jury s work has been reported to near an end and Trump baselessly suggested he was going to be arrested on March 21  The Manhattan investigation is one of fourcriminal probesinto Trump that could end in charges, along with investigations in Fulton County, Georgia, and by the Justice Department into his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and a separate federal probe into Trump bringing White House
