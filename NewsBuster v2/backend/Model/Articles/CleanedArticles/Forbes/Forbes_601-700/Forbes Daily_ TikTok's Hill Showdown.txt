In 15 years, they want their exclusively licensed, seedless version to control 25% of the U.S. fresh lemon market, now dominated by Sunkist with 50%. That would mean 10 million cartons, or 400 million pounds, of seedless lemons grown annually by Wonderful on at least 15,000 acres in California and Mexico.It s an ambitious goal, but could be in reach. In the 1990s and early 2000s, with business partners they sold mandarins under the brand Cuties; then successfully rebranded the small, seedless fruit on their own as Halos. Over the years, Wonderful has swelled to $5 billion in annual sales, with 50% of American households having purchased one of the company s products. And competitors, like Sunkist, know the Resnicks are onto something, and are already trying to churn out their own versions.WHY IT MATTERS  The Resnicks are among the few farmers who can make this kind of investment, though a warming planet and water scarcity are expected to threaten citrus trees like lemons,  saysForbesStaff Writer Chloe Sorvino.  The Resnicks own 155,000 farmland acres, with nearly 125,000 planted in California alone. They have the power to dictate what is sold, and they plan out what they hope consumers will want a decade or more prior to those foods ever securing space in grocery stores.
