TangentLightfoot s re-election campaign has centered on highlighting investments in impoverished neighborhoods under her watch and her early popularity during the pandemic  She has also touted record spending on public safety, including the police department and anti-violence programs  Vallas has cast the city as gripped by out-of-control crime and blamed leadership for failing to hold people accused of crimes accountable  He has advocated for tougher crime penalties, more arrests and hiring more police officers  Johnson, who vows on his campaign website to invest in affordable housing and additional resources for public schools, has faced criticism for his previous support for  defunding  the police  García, who lost a runoff election to Emmanuel in 2015, has spotlighted his Latino
