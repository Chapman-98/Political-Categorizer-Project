Just one problem  The tune, which is best known as the theme for Rocky III, has gotten more than one Republican politician into a bit of hot water Former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee settled a lawsuit with Survivor guitarist Frankie Sullivan in 2016 at a cost of$25,000  I do not like mixing rock and roll with politics; they do not go hand in hand,  Sullivan told Rolling Stone magazine at the time   What upset me most [about Huckabee s use] was that, once again, my song was being used to further a political agenda   and no one even bothered to ask for permission  Also, in 2012, both Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney aroused the band s anger when they both chose the song for their events  Romney agreed to stop using the song at his rallies, while Gingrich was sued and latersettledout of court Haley s campaign didn t immediately respond to a request about whether they were given permission to use the song
