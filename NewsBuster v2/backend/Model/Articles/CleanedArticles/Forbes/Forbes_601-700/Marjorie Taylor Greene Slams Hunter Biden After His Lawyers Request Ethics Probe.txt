All rights reserved.</figcaption></figure>Key FactsHunter Biden s attorney Abbe Lowell accused Greene of  unmoored verbal abuses  against the president s son ina Monday letterto the Office of Congressional Ethics, citing her social media statements suggesting Hunter Biden is involved in human trafficking, drugs, and sex with prostitutes and minors.The letter also cited a Truth Social post by Greene in January in which she posted a photo of Hunter Biden driving his niece and her cousin and accused him of being  on crack  and  wheeling and dealing  with China and  prostitutes. Lowell said the statements amount to  outrageous, undignified rhetoric and brazen violations of the standards of official conduct that do not reflect creditably on the House. Ina separate letter, Lowell also asked the Treasury Department Inspector General to probe how Garrett Ziegler, a former Trump White House official, obtained  suspicious activity reports  from Hunter Biden s bank that he published on his Marco Polo website dedicated to exposing various individuals he claims are involved in  corruption and blackmail. Ziegler claimed he worked with associates at JP Morgan to obtain the five reports which banks are required to send to the Treasury Department when they detect potential illegal activity associated with a transaction and used the documents to  craft a false narrative that Mr. Biden is associated with a human trafficking ring,  Lowell s letter states.Greene doubled down on her accusations against Hunter Biden in tweets on Monday reacting to the letter, claiming  the entire government knows and has proof Hunter Biden was involved in human sex trafficking,  while also alleging a double standard is at play compared to law enforcement investigations against former President Donald Trump:  just imagine if Hunter s last name was Trump, she wrote.Key Background Hunter Biden faces two possible misdemeanor charges of failing to file his taxes in 2016 and 2017, along with felony charges for tax evasion and omitting information on paperwork he was required to fill out to make a gun purchase. His lawyers are expected to meet with DOJ officials this week to discuss the charges, months after federal agents decided they believed they have enough evidence to charge Hunter Biden, the reported. The investigation initially centered around Hunter Biden s international business ventures when it began in 2018, but it expanded into a probe of his taxes and purchase of a .38 revolver. FBI and Internal Revenue Service investigators overseeing the probes have reportedly grown frustrated that the DOJ has yet to make charging decisions. An IRS whistleblower accused the agency of  preferential treatment  and allowing politics to influence decisions in a letter to Congress last week,the Associated Press reported.TangentA2020 published just before the presidential election that detailed the contents of a laptop belonging to the president s son kicked off a flurry of accusations against Hunter Biden, including that his father, while serving as vice-president, used his influence to benefit his son s Ukrainian business ventures. Biden has repeatedly denied having any involvement with his son s professional work, and the White House insists Biden hasnever discussedhis son s business dealings. House Republicans, after winning control of the lower chamber in the midterm election, have ramped up their various probes against Hunter Biden s foreign business dealings in an effort to implicate the president. Hunter Biden s attorneys have recently become more aggressive in attempting to counter the attacks by refusing to comply with Republican House leaders  requests for information to aid their investigations. His lawyers alsofiled a lawsuitlast month against the owner of the laptop repair store that distributed the contents of his computer, alleging he violated his rights to privacy.What We Don t KnowWhether the Office of Congressional Ethics will probe Greene for the conduct described in Lowell s letter. The chair and co-chair of the committee appointed by the top Republican and top Democrat in Congress must agree to open a preliminary review of the issue.
