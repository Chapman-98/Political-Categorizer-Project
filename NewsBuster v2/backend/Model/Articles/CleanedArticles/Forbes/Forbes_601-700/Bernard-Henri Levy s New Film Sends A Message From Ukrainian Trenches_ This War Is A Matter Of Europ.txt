In the film it was clear the Russians were striking very close to you and your crew, at times Bernard-Henri Levy:Yes, sometimes yes, for sure  I felt it strongly in Bakhmut, in Izium  There were drones  Of course, you are feeling danger  How can it be different? But Ukrainians risk their lives every day  Much more than me  Why do Ukrainians risk their lives? To protect my family, my country, my values  So the minimum I can do is to be part of that  To be part of that combat  Even if it is a real risk Katya Soldak: So when you decided to do this journey, and film, what was your primary motivation?BHL: Myprimary motivation was solidarity with the people who were in danger of death  The war in Ukraine isn't under-reported  It was underestimated, that s what was different  We didn t understand what was at stake in Ukraine  It's the very security of Europe, and peace in the world  That's the challenge   to show what's at stake Through my film I explain clearly that we weren't doing the US a favor by arming them(Ukrainians   Forbes)  We were working for our own self interest  This is what I wanted to show Katya Soldak: Why is this war not just Ukrainian? Why does it concern everyone?BHL:That's what Putin says  And it s better from time to time to listen to what the fascist dictators say  Putin said it very clearly: the target is Europe  He wants to create chaos in our countries, he wants to interfere and create a mess in America's elections  He did it once, he probably intends to do it a second time  So we have all the evidence that the target is also the rest of the free world, not only Ukraine Ukraine is the front line  We in Europe are the second line  We here in America are the third line, we're under attack, too  And that's what I want to say and to repeat to public opinion in America and all decision-makers in Washington, D C  This war will matter Putin believes in war, he believes that war is a way for him to engage in politics  We in the West didn't want to see that because it would have been too disturbing  If we had accepted what we saw, it would have required some action to stop him much earlier I don't want this to happen again  That's why I'm going to Washington, D C  That's why I'll speak to decision-makers and audiences in D C , because there's a temptation to say that this war is just a regional affair  There's a temptation to implement a compromise, there probably is a temptation to spare Putin  So it has to be repeated that we would be committing new mistakes for the future Katya Soldak:What do you think the world does not see now?BHL:One mistake we have committed since the invasion is the delivery of weapons in an incremental way  Incremental, you know, progressive  It was a mistake  To save lives, we should have delivered weapons massively and immediately, not in an incremental way  And it's not too late  We can do it now  We can't(deliver)weapons drop by drop, we have to understand that the greater it is, the more massive and the quicker it is, the better it is for saving lives and assuring security  This is what should be understood Katya Soldak:So when you went to the front lines and you spoke to people, did you get a feeling that they need more, that what they have is not enough, did they talk to you about it?BHL:There are so many places where I saw with my eyes the terrible lack of ammunition and weapons  Ukrainians use them with a great sense of economy, of course, but there isn't enough  I could name some front lines without enough ammunition and which are therefore vulnerable  I will not say which ones, for obvious security reasons Early in September, we were at a place very close to Izium the day after its liberation  So morale was high, of course  But they don't have enough weapons  I know that for American opinion, the figures give(people)vertigo: billions, tons  People feel that we've already delivered a lot  I know that it's not enough if we want to save Ukraine, to save Europe, to save peace and to save lives Katya Soldak: From an American point of view, we've already invested many billions of dollars into this  So, clearly, I think the US is expecting Ukraine to win, otherwise they wouldn't be spending that much money,BHL:You have two lines(of thought)in the West  The line which you are presenting   giving Ukraine the means to win  There is a second line, which would be satisfied with a weak Russia  With a weak Putin, but maybe not with Putin at the Hague  You have some people in France, in America, too, who say  okay, we're going to weaken Putin, we're going to put him on his knees, but we prefer to keep him down rather than face the risk of somebody else  This is a mistake  But this mistake exists in the heads of some of the leaders of the West  And I do my best to expose this mistake  In other words, I do my best to convince people that there is no solution other than Russia's total capitulation Katy Soldak: So what would it look like, that total capitulation?BHL:It would mean, number one, giving Ukraine the means for a counter attack and, number two, providing the means to cause the collapse of the Russian army  The Russians aren't able to resist a massive attack by the Ukrainian army  I saw Lyman, I saw Kharkiv, I saw Kherson, I saw Izium, I saw Hulai Pole; I was there  So I know that each time the Ukrainians have the means and the tools, the Russians aren't able to resist  They will collapse first here, then there and when they collapse in enough places, the whole Russian army will collapse If this military collapse happens, Putin will have to accept capitulation, like Germany in 1945  Not like Germany in 1918  Or be taken to the Hague   which is my hope Katya Soldak: And is it going to be one Russia, or smaller states like some people are hoping that it will disintegrate?BHL: We don't know what will happen  You know, each time Russia has lost a war 1905 against Japan, 1916-17 in the First World War, the war in Afghanistan in the 1980s it has (undergone) huge political consequences: a democratic revolution in 1905, the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the democratic revolution after Afghanistan  So something huge will happen, it won't be just a military defeat  What? I don't know Katya Soldak:Did you change over the past year? Was there anything that changed in you or transformed because of this war, in your views, in your perception of certain things?BHL:We all change,  We will never be the same again , as the title of thesonggoes in my film,Slava Ukraini,by Slava Vakarchuk  We will never be the same again  It's true for all Ukrainians; and it's even true for me  I'm not the same after this war  I am not the same, because for one simple reason: there were some values which I thought were in the process of dying   courage, citizen bravery, even the values of Europe   they were slowly dying in my home country  And suddenly, thanks to Ukraine, they seem to be reviving  So this is very impressive  And this changed me because it gave me some new hope
