The governor said Monday the board will have its first meeting next Wednesday, where they re expected to approve additional funding for first responders like firefighters.What We Don t KnowHow big of an impact the board will have. The special district previously called Reedy Creek but now renamed to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District doesn t control Walt Disney World itself or its offerings, but does operate the infrastructure on its property in the same way as a municipal government. That means the board will have control over things like issuing construction permits, waste management, roads and other major structural facets of Disney s property, even if they re not connected to Disney itself. While board members won t have any direct control over Disney s rides or other park offerings, DeSantis hinted Monday the board members could try to use their leverage over Disney with construction permits and the like to influence the company to be less  woke. Crucial Quote When you lose your way, you've got to have people that are going to tell you the truth,  DeSantis said about Disney.  I think all of these board members very much would like to see the type of entertainment that all families can appreciate. Surprising FactDisney has not commented since DeSantis signed the bill on Monday, but the company has previously said it did not intend to fight the government overhauling its special district.  We are focused on the future and are ready to work within this new framework,  Walt Disney World President Jeff Vahle said in a statement after the bill imposing the special district changes passed the state legislature.Chief CriticState Rep. Anna Eskamani (D-Orlando), who represents the area where Walt Disney World is located, slammed the special district bill and DeSantis  appointees in astatementMonday as  extreme and political donors  and  hostile conservative cronies,  and says,  Disney still maintains the same tax breaks   but their First Amendment rights it sends a message to any private individual or company that if you don t purport to what the Governor wants, then you ll be punished. Key BackgroundReedy Creek was first created by the Florida government in 1967 and has largely existed without controversy before becoming a political target last year. While the special district is separate from Disney, the company previously had significant influence over it. As the district s majority landowner, the company had outsized power in electing its board, and Disney hand-picked the other residents who resided on the property and had a vote in how it was run, asreportedby the. The district s long standing status was challenged after Disney publiclyopposedthe  Don t Say Gay  bill after coming under widespread pressure to do so, saying it  should never  have been passed or enacted, and that its  goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts.  That spurred DeSantis and Florida Republicans to attack Disney andenactlegislation getting rid of Reedy Creek entirely. After local officials said getting rid of the special district would force itstax burdenonto local taxpayers, however, the legislature changed course, deciding instead to pass legislation that would keep the special district intact but now change its board to be appointed by the governor.Further ReadingDeSantis Now Controls Disney World s Special District Here s What That Means(Forbes)DeSantis appoints conservative supporters to new Disney board(Washington Post)Ron DeSantis Appoints  Parental Rights  Advocate to Oversee Disney World(Variety)What Bridget Ziegler s Agenda Means for LGBTQ Youth(Bloomberg)
