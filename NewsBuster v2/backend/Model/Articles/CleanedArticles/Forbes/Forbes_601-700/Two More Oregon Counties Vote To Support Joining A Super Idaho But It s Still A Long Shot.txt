ToplineVoters in 2 small eastern Oregon counties passed ballot measures in Tuesday's election asking local officials to explore somehow seceding from the state to join a  Greater Idaho,  bringing the number of Oregon counties that have passed such measures to 11, but some colossal hurdles remain before moving the border comes close to becoming a reality.<figure><figcaption>Voters in several Oregon counties have signaled they d rather be part of neighboring Idaho.Found Image Holdings/Corbis via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>Key FactsSome 60% of voters in Morrow County (pop.: about 12,000) and 58% of voters in Wheeler County (pop.: just under 1,500) supported measures backed by the group  Move Oregon s Border For A Greater Idaho. The group s goal is to redesignate nearly all of Oregon east of the Cascades as part of Idaho, though it pared back an earlier aim to extend Idaho all the wayto the Pacific Oceanand also absorb some northern California counties as part of a  Greater Idaho. Votes in support of a move have been taken in 11 of the 15 counties it proposes moving to Idaho, and organizers say enough signatures have been collected for a ballot measure to appear in a future election in Wallowa County, along the existing Idaho border.What To Watch ForThe only way for the border to move would be for the Oregon legislature, Idaho legislature and Congress to approve new boundaries. Idaho Gov. Brad Little (R) hassuggestedhe supports redrawing the border, but it doesn't appear there is significant support for the movement among state or federal lawmakers.Key BackgroundThe main impetus for the movement is politics, along with cultural differences between rural eastern Oregon and population centers along and near the Pacific coast, such as Portland. The heavily Democratic cities tend to dominate state politics given the relatively small population of eastern Oregon, which is a solidly Republican area former President Donald Trump won more than 70% of the vote in 2020 in more than half the counties that have voted in favor of joining Idaho. Organizers bill the movement as mutually beneficial to both states, arguing it would allow remaining counties in Democratic-leaning western Oregon to pass initiatives without worrying about much Republican pushback, while Idaho would grow both in size and population while retaining its strong conservative identity.Surprising FactOregon appears locked in one of its tightest gubernatorialelectionsin history, with Democrat Tina Kotek leading Republican Christine Drazan 45.7%-44.7% with an estimated 67% of the vote counted. The governor's race has been aworrying contest for Democrats, given former Democrat Betsy Johnson ran as an independent and there were concerns about a red wave of Republican victories across the countries in the midterms, whichdid not pan out. Johnson was running third with 8.8% of the vote as of early Wednesday afternoon.Crucial Quote"If western Oregon doesn t like the risk of being forced to accept the gubernatorial candidate it voted against, then it should simply stop holding our counties captive in this unhappy marriage," movement leader Mike McCartersaidin a statement.Further ReadingOregon Counties Vote To Consider Seceding, Becoming Part Of Idaho(Forbes)Blue States In Play?
