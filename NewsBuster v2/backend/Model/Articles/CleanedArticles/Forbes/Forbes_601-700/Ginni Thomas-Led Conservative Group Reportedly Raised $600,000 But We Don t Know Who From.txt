network of conservative leaders, cultural entrepreneurs, and cultural influences,  received $596,000 between 2019 and the end of 2021, thePostreports The payments were funneled through the right-wing think tank Capital Research Center (CRC) as a  fiscal sponsorship,  according to thePost, which means Crowdsourcers did not have to disclose donors behind the payment, or information about the group s activities and spending that would have been required if it registered as a nonprofit Financial documents cited by thePostdo not say how Crowdsourcers spent the $596,000 or if Thomas received any payment, and while CRC s fiscal sponsorship said it provided  fiduciary oversight, financial management and other administrative services to help build the capacity  of Crowdsourcers, former CRC

Crowdsourcers work, and said Thomas  complied with all reporting and disclosure requirements  Chief CriticThomas was  proud of the work she did with Crowdsourcers, which brought together conservative leaders to discuss amplifying conservative values with respect to the battle over culture,  Paoletta said in a statement to thePost  Thomas has previously denied any impropriety involving her work and her husband s work at the Supreme Court, telling House investigators she can  guarantee that my husband has never spoken to me about pending cases in the court  and she  generally [doesn t] discuss with him my day-to-day work in politics  Surprising FactThomas told supporters that Crowdsourcers  partners in the early days of its operations included right-wing attorney Cleta Mitchell, who told thePostshe  did not know anything about Crowdsourcers and that nothing ever came of the political action committee   Other major right-wing figures that Thomas said were involved with the group, including Project Veritas founder James O Keefe and Turning Point USA president Charlie Kirk, did not respond to requests for comment  According to thePost, Crowdsourcers  communications were done through a private Google group, and emails contained warnings not to reveal members  identities Key BackgroundThomas has come under significantscrutinyin recent months for her right-wing activism and
