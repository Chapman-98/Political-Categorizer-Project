ToplineThe Senatepasseda bill Wednesday that would block a Biden rule allowing retirement funds to take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, which helps screen investments based on socially conscious factors intensifying a GOP push to challenge a "woke" practice that's garnered widespread adoption on Wall Street and trillions of dollars in investor funds

fossil fuel companies The practice has picked uptractionon Wall Street as companies aim to bolster their social and environmental efforts, but increasingly, Republicans havecriticizedESG investing, saying financial institutions should not use their power to invest in so-called woke political agendas On Tuesday, the House passed a bill introducedby Republican Representative Andy Barr (R -Ky) to block the Labor Department rule allowing fund managers to consider ESG practices for retirement plans, citing that retirement plans should focus solely on maximizing returns instead of  woke  agendas The Senate then passed the bill Wednesday in a 50-46 vote, with Democrats Sen  Joe Manchin (W Va) and Sen  Jon Tester (Montana) crossing party lines to support the effort, which will send the bill to Biden s desk, where he is expected to veto it Criticism of ESG investing escalated last week when 25 GOP-led states asked a federal judge to block a Biden Administration rule that took effect on January 30 and allows retirement plans to consider ESG factors in their investment decisions The group, which filed alawsuitin federal court seeking to block the rule completely, argues the ESG provisions "undermine key protections for [the] retirement savings" of 152 million workers by placing a focus on "woke" social rules, rather than financial returns The lawsuit further claims the ESG provisions conflict with tax and labor law requiring retirement advisors to act in the best interests of their clients and put clients' interests above their own by allowing the advisors to prioritize their own ESG policy preferences instead of long-term financial returns However, the Labor Department and proponents of the rule contend ESG factors are relevant to financial returns, as investments subject to climate change risks can ultimately impact profits While no federal laws have been passed to completely ban state assets from being invested in ESG strategies, several Republican states including Iowa, Wyoming and North Dakota have enacted their ownlawsprohibiting investments using social factors for investment strategies Big NumberAccording to PwC, ESG assets areexpectedto eclipse $33 trillion by 2026 commanding some 21 5% of total assets under management Key BackgroundDuring the Trump Administration, the Labor Department passedrulesdiscouraging ESG investing in retirement plans  The rules stated fiduciaries for private pension plans in the Early Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 could not provide investments in ESGs sacrificing investments returns  However, in November, President Joe Bidenloosenedthe rules and made it easier for employers to consider climate change and other ESG investments for their 401(k) plans  As Republicans look to squash state assets being used for any type of ESG or social impact investments, local banking groups have alsopushed backagainst laws barring such investments TangentVivek Ramaswamy, a multimillionaire financier who
