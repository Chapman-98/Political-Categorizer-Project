He understood that the experience of Black students was different - Father Brooks said he would never understand the experience of being Black at Holy Cross, any more than he would understand the experience for women  But he did respect that it created challenges that had to be addressed  So he let the men get a designated "Black" corridor and involved them in matters of campus life  When they talked about wanting to get off campus to meet other Black students, Brooks lent them a car and later paid for a cheap station wagon they'd take turns using on weekends - He listened and learned - Brooks kept his door open to any student who wanted to talk, but he made a concerted outreach to Black students  When a few of the men complained about offensive lyrics to a popular school song, Brooks looked at the song in a new way and pushed to change it  He regularly stopped by the corridor to say hello and was available as a leader who cared   He didn t stereotype,  Thomas told me   He saw people who were individuals who happened to be Black who had very different outlooks  - He challenged the culture - He stood up to alumni who talked about  declining standards,  , and challenged his boss when the president refused to budge on demands that prompted every Black student to quit and walk out  He stood firmly with the students and pushed the institution to change  As he d once told Worcester sEvening Gazette, it was hard to shift the perception of white colleagues who  couldn t see their own bias, never mind overcome it  - He created opportunities - Along with inviting students to share their views, Brooks understood the importance of also bringing in more Black faculty on staff and engaging with the surrounding community  When Wells, now a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, wanted to drop off the football team to focus on academics, Brooks assured him that his scholarship would remain intact  He admitted Jones as a promising young writer even though Jones says his SAT scores were ho-hum  (Let's not debate affirmative action withoutputting legacy admissionsunder the microscope, too) Brooks made it clear, Wells said, that at the very highest levels of the administration, people cared about their success  (Wells last year reflected onthe state of racial justice on the anniversary of George Floyd s murder )- He accepted discomfort - Brooks didn t like the idea of the students segregating themselves into a special corridor, nor did he agree with other views, but he respected the need to change  He'd been one of the rebels a few years earlier in Rome amid Vatican II when the Catholic Church underwent a seismic shift to modernize and become more inclusive  Change, for Brooks, was a constant and leadership meant being in a permanent state of evolution "It's not about what I want or need," he said  It's what's needed today to make a better tomorrow - He showed up  Brooks made a specific point of visibly supporting the Black students  When I talked to the white students who were there at that time and later, they, too, had many stories about how Brooks provided support, humor and guidance in their lives   He was a combination of friend, uncle, priest, father, saint and good Samaritan,  said Thomas   He's a great man  He did right by us  When Thomas came back to the school to accept an honorary degree in June 2012, the Supreme Court Justice teared up during a discussion that I moderated with him and the ailing priest  You saw each of us as a person, not a project,  he said to Father Brooks   I know that I am the better for you having lived
