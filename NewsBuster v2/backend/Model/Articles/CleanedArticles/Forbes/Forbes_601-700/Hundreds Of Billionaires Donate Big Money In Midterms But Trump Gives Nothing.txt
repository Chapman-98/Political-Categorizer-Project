Ask the former president Hundreds of billionaires have pumped money into the 2022 midterm elections  George Soros dumped $129 million into left-leaning super-PACs  Conservatives Dick and Elizabeth Uihlein and Ken Griffin each countered with nearly $55 million  Peter Thiel handpicked a couple of Senate candidates, then seeded them with $15 million apiece Donald Trump, by contrast, appears to have donated nothing Yes, the former president has routed money to his acolytes and has gained a kingmaker reputation for doing so  But the cash Trump is sending to other candidates isn t actually Trump s money  Instead, it s money other people have given to Trump-affiliated groups  Trump then takes those funds, passes some of them along to his allies and basks in the attention that such generosity affords him Consider the $15 million that recently went to support Republicans running for Senate in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Ohio and Georgia  After the 2020 election, Trump raised more than $100 million from an army of supporters across the country  To do so, he started a group named Save America, which qualifies as a leadership PAC, the sort of entity politicians often use to share cash with other candidates  Trump held most of the money for himself, but a month ago, his group transferred $20 million to another outfit called Make America Great Again, Inc  That entity then bought $2 million to $4 million of ads to support candidates in those five states  Trump, in turn, patted himself on the back  In the last two years alone, President Trump s Save America PAC has provided maxed out contributions to over 250 candidates,  Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich said, ignoring the fact that none of that money came from Trump personally   He is responsible for raising over $350 million for [various Republican groups], he has headlined more than 40 fundraisers for candidates, and his name is used by candidates around the nation to raise an incalculable amount of money  No one doubts Trump s ability to raise a lot of money from other people  But some of the reported465 other billionaireswho donated in the 2022 election might be wondering why Trump is not willing to part with any of his own cash  A search of Federal Election Commission documents turned up a handful of donations for small amounts $1 50 here, $25 there from people purporting to be Donald Trump  In all, they add up to less than $200  "Most likely they are not from former President Donald Trump,  concluded Brett Kappel, a campaign-finance attorney at Harmon, Curran, Spielberg & Eisenberg   Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for people to enter false information on those donor forms "For those familiar with the way Trump does business, it should not come as much of a surprise that he is using other people s money rather than his own  Trump, after all, made his name in the 1980s by loading up on debt other people s money and spending like he never had to pay it back  Ultimately, that approach led to a series of bankruptcies  He slowed down but didn t stop, figuring out how to expand his empire by convincing other developers to spend money on various projects, then pay him to slap his name on them  Trump even applied the other-people s-money approach to philanthropy, collecting cash via his foundation and then handing out funds from others as if they were his own When he got into the political arena, Trump promised things would be different   I don t need anybody s money,  he said when announcing his candidacy in 2016   I m using my own money  I m not using lobbyists  I m not using donors  I don t care  I m really rich   He assured supporters, however, that he would use the same hard-nosed tactics he had perfected in the business world to help the United States   It s called OPM,  he said at one rally, laying out his plan to make Gulf states pay for refugee safe zones   I do that all the time in business  It s called other people s money  There s nothing like doing things with other people s money  Trump put $66 million of his own money into his 2016 presidential bid, but he eventually decided other people s money would be nice on the campaign trail as well  His 2016 campaign bolstered his donations with $285 million from others  In 2020, rumors swirled that Trump would end up injecting a big amount of cash into his campaign in its final weeks  But that never came to fruition, and he became theonly billionaire to spend $0 of his own moneyon a White House run  After losing office, Trump stayed on the fundraising circuit, eyeing the 2022 midterms and, perhaps, the 2024 presidential election Additional reporting by Zach Everson
