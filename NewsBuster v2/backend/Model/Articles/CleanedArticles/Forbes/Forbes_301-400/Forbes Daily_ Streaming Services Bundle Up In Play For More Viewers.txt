The Billionaire Pop Star Is One Of The World s Most Powerful Women<figure><figcaption>Taylor SwiftORIANA FENWICK FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE  You re making me feel phenomenal, Taylor Swift likes to tell the sold-out crowds at each stop on her Eras tour, right before she performs her feminist anthem  The Man   The 33-year-old pop star then flexes her bicep and kisses the muscle   You re making me feel,  she says, as a smile spreads across her face,  powerful  But Swiftie fans understand that she is, and has always been, the source of her own power and 17 years into her career,Swift has never had more economic, cultural and political clout  All of which has caused her to soar up the ranks of Forbes  World s Most Powerful Women list, from No  79 in 2022 to No  5 this year Thanks to the record-breaking success of the Eras tour,Swift became a billionaire in October making her the rare recording artist to achieve ten-figure status, joining the likes of Jay-Z (net worth: $2 5 billion) and Rihanna ($1 4 billion) The so-called Taylor Swift Effect casts a wide financial halo, meanwhile  Two nights of her tour in Denver added $140 million to Colorado s GDP, thanks to fans spending an average $1,300 apiece on hotels, restaurants and retailers  She s like a big corporation, essentially, operating in many sectors,  says labor economist and University of Chicago professor Carolyn Sloan   Her audience has skewed so young and so female for so long thatpeople may have underestimated how big this thing could be, economically I don t think anybody doubts that today  Much of Swift s power stems from her direct control over her business  More impressive and potentially far more lucrative is the way in which she reclaimed ownership of her song catalog by rerecording albums that were part of a $300 million sale Swift alleges was done behind her back  She has so far rerecorded and released four of the six albums that were part of that sale When you consider that Katy Perry and Justin Bieber sold the rights to their respective music catalogs in 2023 for more than $200 million, the value of Swift s music will only make her wealthier in the eras to come WHY IT MATTERS  Taylor Swift has had a 17-year career and been an international pop star for much of that time  However, as I say in my story, she's really never had more economic, cultural or political clout than she does right now,  says ForbesWomen editor Maggie McGrath   In reporting out the Power Women list a list whose ranks include world leaders and CEOs of multi-billion-dollar conglomerates I'd be in conversations with sources about the women most qualified to join the Power Women ranks this year, and Swift's name would often come up unprompted  She dominated the zeitgeist this year, and had a real economic impact  MORE The World s Most Powerful WomenFACTS AND COMMENTSAfter two years of dramatic decline in life expectancy,data from the CDCshowsU S  life expectancy roseto 77 5 years in
