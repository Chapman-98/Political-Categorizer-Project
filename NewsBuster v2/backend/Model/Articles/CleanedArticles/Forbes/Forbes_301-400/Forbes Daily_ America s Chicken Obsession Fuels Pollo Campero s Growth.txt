War Is Decimating It<figure><figcaption>Gaza City on October 16, 2023.ALI JADALLAH/ANADOLU/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Palestinian startups have served as a bright spot for a growing local tech scene, with pockets of young companies, incubators and accelerators across Gaza and the West Bank. While small, thattech ecosystem has been viewed as an important part of Palestinians  economic future,Palestinian founders and investors said.But in the face of renewed tragedy and war, it s one that also seems increasingly fragile.After Hamas terrorists attacked Israel and killed 1,300 Israelis last week, kidnapping nearly 200 others, the Israeli government responded with aerial strikes that killed at least 3,000 Palestinians, per local officials, and an evacuation order for 1.1 million Gazan civilians to relocate ahead of an expected ground invasion. Israel has cut off access to water, food and electricity for civilians, and the evacuation has been called a  crime against humanity  by the U.N.Now, what was once atenuous path to economic advancement in one of the poorest placesin the world could vanish entirely.  Tech was actually the last resort they could escape to from the prison,  said Palestinian founder Ram Mere, referring to Gaza'sdescriptionby some human rights groups as an open-air prison.  Now, even that is gone. In Israel, founders and tech employees are mourning killed relatives and grappling with their colleagues getting called up to Israel s military reserves. The country s technology sector, which represents 18% of GDP, raised nearly $10 billion in funding in 2021, according to data from startup funding tracker Crunchbase.By comparison, the Palestinian startup community has received $9.5 million in funding for all of 2021, at a combined valuation of $66 million, according toFast Company Middle East.Forbesspoke to several Palestinian founders and members of its tech community based largely in the West Bank, who told us that they are unsure if their colleagues in Gaza are safe.Ramallah-based Sondos Mleitat, the cofounder and CEO of online mental health platform Hakini, is trying to set up a free mental health phone hotline for Gazans.

Alex remembers personally attending a hackathon for Israeli and Palestinian founders in Jerusalem years ago. But in Gaza and the West Bank, Palestinian entrepreneurs described unique challenges they have faced while starting their companies, such as reduced access to early stage capital and international funding. Right now, the founders featured in this story are grieving the loss of life and community in Gaza, with many currently unable to reach friends, family and colleagues.We wanted to feature them and their resilience.
