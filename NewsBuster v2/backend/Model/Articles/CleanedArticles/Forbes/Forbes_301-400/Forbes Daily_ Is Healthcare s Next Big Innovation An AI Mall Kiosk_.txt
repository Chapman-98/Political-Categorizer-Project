But spyware companies are now exploring how to use it and other emerging AI tools to surveil people on social media.In a presentation at the Milipol homeland security conference in Paris on Tuesday, online surveillance company Social Links demonstrated ChatGPT performing  sentiment analysis," where the AI assesses the mood of social media users or can highlight commonly-discussed topics amongst a group. That can then help predict whether online activity will spill over into physical violence and require law enforcement action.Founded by Russian entrepreneur Andrey Kulikov in 2017, Social Links now has offices in the Netherlands and New York; previously, Meta dubbed the company a spyware vendor in late 2022, banning 3,700 Facebook and Instagram accounts it had used to repeatedly scrape the social sites.But that hasn t halted its growth: Company sales executive Rob Billington said Social Links had more than 500 customers, half of which were based in Europe, with just over 100 in North America. That Social Links is using ChatGPT shows howOpenAI s breakout tool of 2023 can empower a surveillance industrykeen to tout artificial intelligence as a tool for public safety.According to the American Civil Liberties Union s senior policy analyst Jay Stanley, using AI tools like ChatGPT to augment social media surveillance will likely  scale up individualized monitoringin a way that could never be done with human monitors,  he toldForbes.That s a problem not just because this kind of technological eavesdropping could amplify inaccuracies or biases. It could also chill discourse online becauseeveryone feels  that they're being watched, not necessarily by humans, but by AI agents that have the ability to report things to humans who can bring consequences down on your head,  Stanley added.WHY IT MATTERS  ChatGPT went viral after it showed an astonishing ability to understand questions and respond to them like a hyper-intelligent human,  saysForbes senior writer Thomas Brewster.  It's been feared that same capability could be used to assist police in their surveillance operations. And that's exactly what's happening here. It's an early sign that large language models like OpenAI's tool are going to form part of surveillance technologies and could be used to clamp down on protest and free speech.
