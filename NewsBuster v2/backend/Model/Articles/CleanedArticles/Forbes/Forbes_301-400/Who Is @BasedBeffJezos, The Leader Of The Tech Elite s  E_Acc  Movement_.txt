Forbes has learned that Guillaume Verdon, the founder of stealth AI startup Extropic and a former Google engineer, is behind the provocative Twitter account leading the  effective accelerationism  movement sweeping Silicon Valley By Emily Baker-White, Forbes StaffAndreessen Horowitz cofounder Marc Andreessensays@BasedBeffJezos is a  patron saint of techno-optimism   Garry Tan, who cofounded the venture firm Initialized Capital before becoming CEO of Y Combinator,calls him brother   Sam Altman, who founded OpenAI   the company that finally mainstreamed artificial intelligence   has jokinglysparredwith him on Twitter  Elon Musksayshis memes are       Andreessen, Tan, and several dozen other Silicon Valley luminaries have also begun aligning with a movement that  Jezos  claims to have founded:  effective accelerationism,  or e/acc  At its core, e/acc argues that technology companies should innovate faster, with less opposition from  decels  or  decelerationists    folks like AI safety advocates and regulators who want to slow the growth of technology At first blush, e/acc sounds a lot like Facebook s old motto:  move fast and break things   But Jezos also embraces more extreme ideas, borrowing concepts from  accelerationism,  which argues we should hasten the growth of technology and capitalism at the expense of nearly anything else  On X, the platform formally known as Twitter where he has 50,000 followers, Jezos has claimed that  institutions have decayed beyond the point of salvagingand that the media isa  vector for cybernetic control of culture  So just who is the anonymous Twitter personality whose message of unfettered, technology-crazed capitalism at all costs has captivated many of Silicon Valley s most powerful?Forbeshas learned that the Jezos persona is run by a former Google quantum computing engineer named Guillaume Verdon who founded a stealth AI hardware startup Extropic in 2022 Forbes first identified Verdon as Jezos by matching details that Jezos revealed about himself to publicly available facts about Verdon  A voice analysis conducted by Catalin Grigoras, Director of the National Center for Media Forensics, compared audio recordings of Jezos and talks given by Verdon and found that it was 2,954,870 times more likely that the speaker in one recording of Jezos was Verdon than that it was any other person Forbesis revealing his identity because we believe it to be in the public interest as Jezos s influence grows In a wide-ranging interview withForbes, Verdon confirmed that he is behind the account, and extolled the e/acc philosophy   Our goal is really to increase the scope and scale of civilization as measured in terms of its energy production and consumption,  he said  Of the Jezos persona, he said:  If you're going to create an ideology in the time of social media, you ve got to engineer it to be viral  At various points, on Twitter, Jezos has defined effective accelerationism as  a memetic optimism virus,   a meta-religion,   a hypercognitive biohack,   a form of spirituality,  and  not a cult   But in an interview, Verdon put it differently:  We're kind of just optimistic people that want to build a better future  It's pretty straightforward  He noted that Jezos doesn t reflect his IRL personality   The memetics and the sort-of bombastic personality, it's what gets algorithmically amplified,  he said, but in real life,  I m just a gentle Canadian    We re trying to solve culture by engineering   <footer>Guillaume Verdon</footer>When he s not tweeting about e/acc, Verdon runs Extropic, which he started in 2022  Some of his startup capital came from a side NFT business, which he started while still working at Google s moonshot lab X  The project began as an April Fools joke, but when it started making real money, he kept going:  It's like it was meta-ironic and then became post-ironic   He used the money he made to buy GPUs, sold his car and moved back in with his parents In August, The Informationreportedthat Extropic, which was previously called Qyber, was designing a microchip  specifically to run LLMs,  or large language models  It has raised money from venture capital firms HOF Capital, Julian Capital, Buckley Ventures, and other minor investors  Verdon says he has raised $14 1 million On Twitter, Jezos described the company as an  AI Manhattan Project  and once quipped,  If you knew what I was building, you d try to ban it   Verdon declined to disclose more details about Extropic, but he described the project as  creating a different type of physics-based computer that is not quantum   He said his Jezos persona has been  very instrumental to get all sorts of deal flow, whether it's talent, investors, or partnerships  Extropic investors HOF Capital and Julian Capital did not respond to a comment request  Tan, Altman and Musk did not respond to comment requests  Andreessen declined to comment through a spokesperson At its core, effective accelerationism embraces the idea that social problems can be solved purely with advances in technology, rather than by messy human deliberation   We re trying to solve culture by engineering,  Verdon said   When you're an entrepreneur, you engineer ways to incentivize certain behaviors via gradients and reward, and you can program a civilizational system "He expects computers to eventually solve legal problems too: "At the end of the day, law is just natural language code for how to operate the system, and there's no reason why technology can't have impact there in terms of social problems  Not everyone agrees that engineering is the answer to societal problems   The world is just not like that  It just isn t,  said Fred Turner, a professor of communications at Stanford University who has studied accelerationism   But if you can convince people that it is, then you get a lot of the power that normally accrues to governments  E/acc is also a reaction to another Silicon Valley movement: effective altruism (or EA)  While it was originally focused on optimizing each person s ability to help others (and is known for some of its most famous adherents willingness to engage in fraud), EA has also become a hotbed for people concerned about whether AI might become sentient and murder humans   so-called  doomers  that Jezossays are instrumental to forces of evil and civilizational decline    We ve got to make sure AI doesn't end up in the hands of a single company   <footer>Guillaume Verdon</footer> If we only focus on the end of the world, bio weapons, [artificial general intelligence] ending us all, then   we might engender our own doom by obsessing over it and it demoralizes people and it doesn't make them want to build,  Verdon said He referenced multiple large AI startups  ties to the EA movement, including OpenAI, which just underwent a major board struggle where CEO Sam Altman wasoustedand then quicklyreinstated, ostensibly overAI safety related issues  Verdon is part of a loud chorus in the AI community who believe that this technology should not be developed in secret at companies like OpenAI, but instead be open-sourced   We think this whole AI safety industry is just a pretense for securing more control,  he said  If you're interested in safety, decentralization and freedom is kind of the way to go,  he toldForbes   We ve got to make sure AI doesn't end up in the hands of a single company  In its reaction against both EA and AI safety advocates, e/acc also explicitly pays tribute to another longtime Silicon Valley idea   This is very traditional libertarian right-wing hostility to regulation," said Benjamin Noys, a professor of critical theory at the University of Chichester and scholar of accelerationism  Jezos calls it the  libertarian e/acc path  As a Twitter personality, Jezos has been something of a troll   making outlandish pronouncements behind a veil of in-crowd anonymity  But not all e/acc adherents have been fans of the persona   You create an idea, you don t actually have anything to show anyone, and the idea somehow becomes real   and so does the money   <footer>Benjamin Noys, a professor of critical theory at the University of Chichester</footer>One person in an e/acc-dedicated Discord server, using the name of a venture capitalist, said,  It s silly that he bigs himself up with an anon account with a cartoon pic   it is unserious   Yeah, the anon stuff is not helping,  said another member of the chat, who added that he was  not impressed  with Jezos   techno-babble   Dude needs to dox himself, and start speaking math and engineering,  said another person (Revealing the name behind an anonymous account of public note is not  doxxing,  which is an often-gendered form of online harassment that reveals private information   like an address or phone number   about a person without consent and with malicious intent )Verdon said he has decided to take a different approach   I guess that now that my identities are going to be correlated, that's going to allow me to put my actual name behind my words  And the reason I agreed to do this interview is because I think that it's kind of time for me to do that,  he said On a recent evening at San Francisco s 1015 Folsom nightclub, a masked Jezos waded through a crowd of AI founders, investors and developers dancing to music DJ ed by Grimes  He doffed his mask to take selfies that would later appear in a public Facebook post made under Verdon s name  There, he would also tout his role in producing a  Keep AI Open  rave festooned with NRA-style Come And Take It posters that swapped guns for neural networks and GPUs   Starting the SF cyberpunk AI counter-culture scene,  Verdon captioned the Facebook post   The vibes were impeccable,  he toldForbes The party, which Jezos cast as a great victory from his Twitter account, was sponsored in part by Extropic  Guests were given e/acc-branded shirts and hats, versions of which are now for sale on anofficial e/acc merch store  (Other e/acc-branded items are alsofor sale on Amazon, but they appear to have been designed by a different vendor )  There's a whole aesthetic kind of forming and hopefully we could keep that going,  Verdon said   The truth is, they have no social vision   <footer>Fred Turner, a professor of communication at Stanford</footer>Noys, the Chichester professor, toldForbesthat branding is critical to the accelerationist project  He compared e/acc to other familiar Silicon Valley and Wall Street hype cycles like cryptocurrency: With enough people talking about a concept, he said, some accelerationists believe you can build something from nothing   You create an idea, you don t actually have anything to show anyone, and the idea somehow becomes real   and so does the money  That idea of building something from nothing   called  hyperstition    was popularized by Nick Land, a philosopher, blogger and activist who has been both credited as a father of modern accelerationism and discredited for his embrace of racism and the alt-right  Land, whom Andreessen also deemed a  patron saint of techno-optimism,  hasexplicitly endorsedJezos s vision of e/acc, and Jezos hasexplicitly embraced Land  In recent years, Land has devoted his efforts tomaking the case against democracyalongside the alt-right provocateur Curtis Yarvin, who favors rebooting  our government with a  start-up guy  to act as a dictator-monarch Verdon said he came across Land s writings as he began working on a Substack post with a friend   known anonymously online as @bayeslord   about what they would later deem e/acc   Someone told us that this theory, what we were writing, was very similar to his works,  he said  But Verdon noted that he s never talked to Land or Yarvin For all their talk of accelerating, it is not clear what future Verdon and other e/acc adherents want to accelerate into  Turner, the Stanford professor, said he wasn t sure that they themselves know:  The truth is, they have no social vision  And they can t have a social vision, because the solutions that they re proposing to social change and social politics so radically simplify the complexities of social life  But Verdon has a social vision of his own:  If we can make it so that more people are optimistic about the future, are inclined to build, take risks and go forth and have the greatest impact it can on the world, that's a net positive  So if we have to be not so polite on the timeline, then so be it  Alex
