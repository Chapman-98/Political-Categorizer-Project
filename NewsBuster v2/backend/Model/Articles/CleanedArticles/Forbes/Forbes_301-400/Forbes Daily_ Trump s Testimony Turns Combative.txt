automatically when they re pushed beyond a certain range The problem has only gotten worse, they say Retailers reported $112 billion in losses last year from  shrink,  which aside from stolen merchandise, includes items that have been damaged or lost because of vendor fraud or paperwork screwups up from $94 billion in 2021, according to the National Retail Federation  Organized retail-crime groups who resell the goods online are the main culprits, retailers say, and their nefarious handiwork has taken such a toll that the CEOs of Walmart, Target and Best Buy, among others, have used quarterly earnings calls to decry the problem  Last month, Target closed nine stores, blaming high levels of theft and safety concerns However, media investigations, as well as a recent report from analysts at the investment bank William Blair, have questioned the severity of losses from theft and suggested thatretailers are using the issue to divert attention from other problems,
