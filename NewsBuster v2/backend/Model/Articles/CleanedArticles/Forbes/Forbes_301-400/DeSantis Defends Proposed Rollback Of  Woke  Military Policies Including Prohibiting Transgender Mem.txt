When Tapper challenged his view that  woke  policies were impacting recruiting, citing an Army study showing concerns over discrimination outweighed concerns about  wokeness,  DeSantis blamed the results on people being unaware of the true definition of the word.Crucial Quote  I think there s an issue about, like, not everyone really knows what wokeness is,  DeSantis said when Tapper asked him about the Army recruitment study.  I mean, I ve defined it, but a lot of people who rail against wokeness can t even define it. ContraDepartment of Defense officials have rejected the notion that the military is more focused on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives than its core mission of protecting the United States. Air Force Chief Master Sgt. JoAnne Bass suggested the narrative that the military is engaged in  woke  military policies was hurting recruitment more than those policies themselves in a congressional hearing earlier this month.  Where we could use your help is by sharing that message that your services are not focused on any of those [DEI] training more than we are on warfighting,  she told lawmakers. Pentagon officials also say they arestruggling to competewith traditional employers in a strong labor market, and many people don t meet the military s physical fitness standards.Key Background As governor, DeSantis implemented a series of right-wing policies targeting what he refers to as  woke  initiatives, including banning teaching about sexual orientation and gender identity below a certain grade level, prohibiting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in state-funded colleges and universities, and banning abortions under six weeks of pregnancy. DeSantis has also waged a war with Disney over its denouncement of the state s  Don t Say Gay  law, and the company has sued his administration as a result of his tactics to limit its power.TangentDeSantis sat for an interview with Tapper as his campaign is reportedly recalibrating its strategy amid bleak polling numbers that have shown him trailing former President Donald Trump by double digits for months. Part of the new approach includes lifting a moratorium on mainstream media interviews.Further Reading DeSantis Signs Bill Banning Public Colleges From Funding Diversity Programs(Forbes)DeSantis Laughs Off Concerns About His Campaign As GOP Eyes A New Trump Alternative (Forbes)What Does  Woke  Even Mean?
