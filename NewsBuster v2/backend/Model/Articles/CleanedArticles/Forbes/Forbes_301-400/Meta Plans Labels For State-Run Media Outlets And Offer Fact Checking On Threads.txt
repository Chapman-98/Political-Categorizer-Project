Mosseri tried to justify this decision by saying:  any incremental engagement or revenue they might drive is not at all worth the scrutiny, negativity (let's be honest), or integrity risks that come along with them.  Despite efforts to stay away from politics, the week-old app has already come under fire from right-wing commentators and politicians who haveaccusedThreads of censoring conservatives. Users attempting to follow certain right-wing figures including Donald Trump Jr. on Threads were greeted with a warning saying the account has  repeatedly posted false information.  Meta later said the warnings were the result of an error that has been fixed.TangentEarlier this year, Twitter decided toditch labelsfor state-affiliated media outlets and government entities after limiting its verified badge to accounts that pay for its $8-a-month subscription. The labels had been in use since 2020, but they became a subject of controversy in April after the platform s owner Elon Muskimplemented changesthat added the  state-affiliated  badge to public broadcasters such as NPR, BBC, PBS and CBC. NPR rejected the label, touting its editorial independence, andsaidit receives less than 1% of its annual budget from the federal government. Both NPR and PBS stopped posting on Twitter after the labels were added.Further ReadingThreads Won t Promote Political Or Hard News Content   A Contrast From Twitter(Forbes)Conservatives Accuse Threads Of Censorship But Meta Claims It Was An Error(Forbes)
