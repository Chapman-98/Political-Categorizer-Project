Way To Beat Amazon<figure><figcaption>ILLUSTRATION BY YUNJIA YUAN FOR FORBES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE For decades, Amazon s lower prices and speedier delivery have blown a crater in the college bookstore business  Given the option to shop around, students only buy about one-third of their course materials at the campus store Now the bookstores are fighting back with a model thatautomatically charges students for textbooks on their tuition bills, which can be covered by financial aid, and get them to students by the time classes begin Books are typically discounted 30% or more, say the bookstores, and students must return materials at the end of the semester  Despite reservations fromeducation advocates who worry it limits purchasing options for students, the plan, dubbed Inclusive Access, is spreading like kudzu It rose out of a 2015 rule from the U S  Department of Education that permitted universities to include the cost of textbooks with tuition, as long as prices were under competitive market rates and students could opt out Bookstores latched onto the idea during the pandemic, when they werelooking to boost sales as they were hamstrung by closures, declining enrollment numbers and the seismic shift to digital textbooks In the 2022-23 academic year, Inclusive Access already captured the business of 44% of students, worth an estimated $1 4 billion annually, according to the National Association of College Stores Sell-through rates, which measure the percentage of course materials students purchase at the campus bookstore, skyrocketed from about 30% before Inclusive Access to north of 80 or 90%, according to Follett and Barnes & Noble Education, which each operate about one-third of campus bookstores  Few students opt out because they like the prices and convenience, the companies said Unable to compete with Amazon, Follett and Barnes & Noble Educationseparated their customers from the open marketplaceand bundled their products with something Amazon couldn t sell college tuition WHY IT MATTERS  Theway students are buying their textbooks is changingfast,  saysForbesstaff writer Lauren Debter   Determined not to be left out, the nation s two largest operators of campus bookstores have persuaded hundreds of schools to begin automatically charging students for course materials  It s a clever move that shuts out competition and guarantees sales  But as it becomes more widely adopted, is it good for students?
