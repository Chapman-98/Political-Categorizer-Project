Of<figure><figcaption>Elisabeth DeLuca pictured in 2017 at the trial of her late husband against his former partner in a real estate deal LANNIS WATERS/USA TODAY NETWORK</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Subway heir and former nurse Elisabeth DeLuca isone of the richest women in the world, worth an estimated $8 2 billion  But she s far from a household name Behind the scenes, the Florida-based DeLuca has quietly been forging a legacy separate from Subway and from that of her late husband, Subway cofounder Fred DeLuca, who died of leukemia in 2015 largely through giving away the fortune he built  For example, DeLuca donated $40 million to her alma mater the University of Connecticut, its single biggest gift ever, to build a new nursing school facility DeLuca and her son Jonathan inherited the fortune including her husband s stake in the business and billions in cash, according toForbes  reporting  Then in August, she and the family of deceased Subway cofounder Peter Buck agreed to sell the sandwich chain to private equity firm Roark Capital in a $9 7 billion deal that will put another estimated $3 4 billion in cash into her family s pockets The record-breaking gift to UConn is just the latest gift  DeLuca already funneled at least $710 million of cash and stock into two family foundations between 2015 and 2021, per an analysis of the most recent available IRS filings  While most of the money was put into a foundation set up by her husband in 1997, Elisabeth incorporated another one in her name in December 2020 and moved $250 million into it the next year As of 2021, thefoundations had doled out $100 million to mostly Florida- and Connecticut area charities that support education and youth groups like Boys and Girls clubs WHY IT MATTERS DeLuca s style of philanthropy falls in line with anew cohort of women quietly giving away their fortunes, with none of the pomp and flash that some donors lean into, including philanthropists like Lynn Schusterman, Laurene Powell Jobs, and perhaps the best known, MacKenzie Scott, the billionaire ex-wife of Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos MORE This Super Private Heir Will Bag Billions From Subway s
