the pulse oximeter, a blood oxygen sensor that was introduced in the Series 6 in 2020 APPLE</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE The International Trade Commission issued an order tohalt the importation of certain Apple Watches into the U S  last week, handing a major win to medical device-maker Masimo in a years-long patent battle with the most valuable company in the world It s an important bargaining chip for Masimo founder and CEO Joe Kiani, who said his company has spent upwards of $65 million related to ongoing patent and trade secret litigation with Apple over its pulse oximeter, a blood oxygen sensor that has become a selling point for premium smartwatches and fitness trackers TheCommission sided with Masimo that Apple infringed on two patentsrelated to the pulse oximeter, and the ban would prohibit certain Apple Watches that include the sensor from being imported into the U S  It also includes a cease-and-desist order that stops sales of infringing products already in the country The import ban is now subject to a 60-day presidential review and, barring intervention by the Biden administration, is slated to go into effect on December 25  Apple said it plans to appeal the decision, which does not immediately affect Apple Watch sales But unless Apple can convince the Biden administration to veto the ruling in the next two months, theban would go into effect while the appeals process playsout in federal court  A presidential veto of an International Trade Commission ruling is exceedingly rare, said John Presper, counsel at Foster, Murphy, Altman & Nickel, who isn t involved in the litigation but represents clients before the Commission Kiani toldForbeshe hopes the ITC decision  might speed things up  and push $2 7 trillion Apple toward a settlement

regulations  There is a longshot chance that Apple might attempt to disable the blood oxygen function in order to comply with the Commission s decision, but the most likely outcome is a settlement
