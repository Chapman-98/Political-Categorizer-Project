100 million pounds this Thanksgiving roughly five ounces for every human being in the country Most of those carrots are produced by just two companies, Bolthouse and Grimmway, which were both acquired by buyout firms in 2019 and 2020 respectively Such market consolidation often leads to shoppers paying more: Since 2019, carrot producer prices have increased more than 40%, according to the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics, outpacing the 22% inflation in the U S  economy Consumers, workers and neighbors of the two producers in Southern California s Cuyama Valley are calling for a boycott of Big Carrot over the amount of water the farmsare sucking out of the ground Together, Grimmway and Bolthouse pump a large amountof the area s water, or about what s used by a medium-sized city like Santa Barbara  Local residents say they expect their wells to dry up if the carrot farms keep pumping like they do Grimmway CEO Jeff Huckaby toldForbes his company has already cut back on the amount of acreage it farms and the two carrot producers have joined forces to defend their thirst in court The battle in Cuyama Valley is an example of the kinds of water fights that are surfacing across California  Farming has depended on irrigation for decades  Those years of pumping water and spraying it over crops through sprinklers or complex drip irrigation systems have had drastic implications, including threats of sinkholes, a receding water table that makes it tougher to dig wells, and the threat of some of them drying out Grimmway and Bolthouse can move on, unlike most of the residents in New Cuyama, Pomona College environmental analysis and politics professor Heather Williams, an expert on water issues, toldForbes  These are their homes, their small farms If the well goes dry, it s worth basically nothing,  she said   They can t pay lawyers for 10 years of litigation  WHY IT MATTERS  Thanksgiving meals are all about gluttony,  saysForbesstaff writer Chloe Sorvino   But there are
