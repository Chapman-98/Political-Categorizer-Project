targets  Some analystssaw reasons to be cautious, warning the company may not be able to get a larger market share in cloud features or improve its margins Earnings reports are essentially snapshots of three months in time for a company  For a new and novel technology such as AI, there areample opportunities for both Microsoft and Alphabet to prove themselves  But there are also many opportunities for a new player to shift the paradigm something both Microsoft and Alphabet both did when they entered the technology market IN THE HEADLINES<figure><figcaption>Meta's sign at its Menlo
