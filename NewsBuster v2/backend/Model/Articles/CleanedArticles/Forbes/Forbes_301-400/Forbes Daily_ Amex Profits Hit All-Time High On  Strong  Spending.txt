Anyways?<figure><figcaption>In-person mandates are up  Bosses have more power to enforce face time  Yet after years of remote work, the role of the office has fundamentally changed, prompting a vast rethinking of what the  workplace  is really for MARTIN BARRAUD/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE What s the real role of the office today?It s a question that s been puzzling executives, frustrating workers and causing headaches for H R   When I ask CEOs and executives  what is the purpose of your office?,  I am eight out of ten times met with blank stares,  says Kelly Col√≥n, a Boston-basedworkplace consultant and former adviser with office furniture maker Allsteel For decades centuries, perhaps no one had to ask about the office s purpose  Before laptops, cell phones and the Internet, it was the place for people to get work done in the same room, for managers to keep a watchful eye on their people and for companies to splash their name on a building that highlighted their brand, cemented their culture and showcasedtheir status Now, manywhite-collar workplaces exist in a hybrid purgatory, torn between managerial nostalgia and CEO opinions about remote work s downsides, andthe real need of workers to avoid crippling commutes while meeting life s many commitments Meanwhile, plenty of employees want or even need a place to work that s not their cramped apartment, and many agree that physicallybeing with colleagues helps build relationships, ease collaboration and speed up certain work The problem: There snot enough consensus between workers and managerson how often or where that time together should happen The near religious rhetoric about  return to office  and  remote work  obscures a simple fact: Much of this comes down to common sense  Not all businesses are the same  What works for an established law firm may make no sense for a startup toy company Many companies are rethinking how offices work, making more room for meetings and socialization  They re adding booths or private rooms for Zoom calls,reducing square footage and renting real estate on-demand Being collaborative and making time for connection doesn t always have to happen in a company s office  Offsite retreats are booming, demand for flexible space is soaring and platforms for office alternatives are proliferating In the end, rethinking where offices are located, how they re designed or how often they re used doesn t mean they re not needed at all WHY IT MATTERS  Even as more CEOs, emboldened by a cooler labor market, have been issuing stricter return-to-office mandates as the calendar turned to fall, the data shows visits are only slightly higher, and many experts predict hybrid work will be a permanent part of professional life,  says Jena McGregor,ForbesSenior Editor for Careers and Leadership Strategy   What that means for commercial real estate, downtown districts, office design and workers' commutes and schedules is just coming into view  But the office's role has fundamentally changed, from a place to be seen and get individual work done to one that's a home for socialization and collaboration  MORE The War Over Work From Home:
