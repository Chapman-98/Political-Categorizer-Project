every year DAILY COVER STORYInside Paypal s Billion Dollar Battle For Payment Processing Dominance<figure><figcaption>ILLUSTRATION BY YUNJIA YUAN FOR FORBES; PHOTO BY DBENITOSTOCK/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Consumers rarely think about who processes their payments at checkout, as long as it is fast and hassle free  But behind the scenes, there is abattle underway to control  buy now  technology  E-commerce sales in the U S  alone surpassed $1 trillion in 2022, from which billions in revenues and profits flowed to dozens of firms vying to be at the center of the transactions, including industry giant PayPal Last year, the San Jose company began cutting the cost of payment services it offers under its Braintree brand, a white-label service that lets companies small and large accept debit cards, credit cards and other payment methods from consumers PayPal is making a land-grab play in North America to gain market share over close competitors including Dutch processor Adyen and fintech darling Stripe, analysts say  It s trying to reel in merchants by offering lower prices on Braintree services and then bundle them with more profitable features like branded checkout, its credit products or PayPal Payouts, which helps merchants like Uber pay their drivers Thepayments processing business is one that thrives on tiny percentages  In 2022, PayPal had net revenue of $27 5 billion, or 2% of the $1 36 trillion total transaction volume that it processed  Competitor Adyen, more of a pure play in transaction processing, had revenues of $1 4 billion from $815 billion in processed volume, or just 0 17% of its volume  Stripe s revenues were $3 2 billion from $817 billion in volume, or 0 39% percent The risk PayPal runs by cutting processing fees istriggering a race to the bottom  If all three companies chose to cut prices, they would all take hits to their bottom line, though that may be less risky for Paypal given its higher margins and the fact that it has the wider suite of products available for cross-selling WHY IT MATTERS The slowdown in e-commerce spending post-pandemic hasput pressure on all three companies to maintain the coronavirus-era growththat thrilled investors  In 2020, PayPal and Adyen s stocks rose 116% and 173%, respectively  This year, they are down 19% and 47% MOREBetter Late Than Never: Federal Reserve
