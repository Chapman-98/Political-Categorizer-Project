Dr. Disrespect, a gamer with 4.5 million YouTube subscribers,said everything is starting to make sense  after he found out Bethesda s head of publishing Pete Hines has his pronouns listed in his X bio, and he laterpostedon X that  politics should stay out of the video game industry entirely. YouTuber NinaInfinityposted,  I almost refunded my game when #Starfield asked me for pronouns, statingin a later post she decided to have her purchase refunded not just because of the pronouns option, but because of glitches she experienced while playing.Chief CriticsStreamer The Act Man, who has 1.8 million YouTube subscribers,criticizedHeelsvBabyface for being  on the verge of crying becauseStarfieldlets you pick pronouns at the start of the game, callingthe issue  superfluous  because he  cannot recall a single moment where my character's pronouns were brought up.  Hutch, a Twitchstreamerwith 360,000 followers,calledthe negative reactions to the pronoun option  wildly unhinged,  noting the selection is simply  a single button press to clarify your pronouns inStarfield.  Streamer Keffals, who has 52,000 Twitchfollowers, ridiculed reactions that urged politics to be kept out of video games, noting that Bethesda s other games are political:  I can't believe bethesda would make starfield political by adding pronouns. I'm only going to play their other games like the fallout franchise which is about the social and political implications of nuclear war and is not political whatsoever,  Keffalsposted.ContraHeelvsBabyface defended himself in a YouTubevideotitled,  Man  Cancelled  For Having Opinion on Internet!!  in which he doubled down on criticizing  the gender ideology and intersectionality that s been rammed into every solitary facet of our entertainment, from video games to TV, film, comics, etc. TangentSome social media users drew comparisons betweenStarfieldandHogwarts Legacy, another video game that facedcontroversyand boycotts because of its association with J.K. Rowling, theHarry Potterauthor who has become known for making comments critics perceive to be anti-trans.Hogwarts Legacyalso faced criticism for including a transgender woman character named Sirona Ryan, whose name attracted criticism for allegedly sounding masculine. After HeelvsBabyface sStarfieldrant, The Act Man accused him of hypocrisy,postinga video in which HeelvsBabyface urges people boycottingHogwarts Legacybecause they think it  goes against your ideology  to  man up.  HeelvsBabyface responded to this criticism in his YouTube video, stating he was actually talking about how he would not  bow down to the intersectional woke far-left ideological mob that wanted to cancel it.
