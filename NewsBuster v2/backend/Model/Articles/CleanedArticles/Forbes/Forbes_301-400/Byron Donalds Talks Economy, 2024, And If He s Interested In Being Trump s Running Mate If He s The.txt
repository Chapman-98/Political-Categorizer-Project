Congressman Byron Donalds (R-FL) joinsForbes Newsroom for a wide-ranging discussion on the biggest issues facing Americans, 2024, and the future of politics. In a 2022 conversation withForbes, he pointed to inflation as the largest problem challenging Americans. Over a year later, he still agrees. The impact of inflation over the past two-and-a-half years has impacted every American,  Donalds tellsForbes.In June, inflation hit a two-year low, but prices continue to remain stubborn. The solution, according to the Florida Republican?  The number one thing we are trying to do on Capitol Hill is cut spending ... you get inflation by the government pumping too much money into an economy. In this calendar year, former President Donald Trump has been indicted twice, and most recently, has been charged withthree more federal crimesin relation to the White House documents case. The indictments do not deter Donalds  support, but  embolden  it, and the Florida Republican still endorses Trump for president in 2024. If Donald Trump won the GOP presidential nomination, would Byron Donalds be interested in being his running mate? Yea, I mean, it s an honor,  Donalds tellsForbes.
