ILLUSTRATION BY FORBES; GRAPHICS BY CSA IMAGES/GETTY IMAGES, PRO_VECTOR/ADOBE STOCK</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE Aclosed-end investment company is a peculiar beast Unlike funds that are open-end or exchange-traded, a closed-end does not have any mechanism for liquidating the holdings of departing customers  Its shares trade in the second-hand market, with prices, set by supply and demand, that can veer far away from their asset value A fund selling with a  15% off  sticker is not the same sort of thing as a discounted kitchen appliance  If you were prepared to buy the dishwasher at full price, a 15% sale is money in the bank Not so with a fund  Availability of a discount on it doesn t leave you better off unless something happens to turn the fund s portfolio into cash for you  That could be a liquidation of the fund, an uncommon occurrence, or else a payout from the fund Most of the closed-end funds out there are trading at discounts Only a few are genuine bargains  These are the ones that combine a discount with two other things: distributions of cash and reasonable expense ratios There is, in fact,a simple formulathat relates three variables discount, distribution rate and expense ratio to tell you when a closed-end is worth a look Forbeslooked at the 15 best buys for closed-end funds by cranking that formula into a database of closed-ends available from Ycharts, an
