This story is part of the , where you can find handpicked presents for everyone on your list.If you re looking to give presents that will surprise and delight recipients of all ages this holiday season, then look no further than the very best tech gifts. Let s face it: A smartwatch will always be more fun than socks, a new pair of AirPods will receive greater fanfare than a scented candle and a sleek new TV will always wow on Christmas morning (or otherwise). But if you re a novice to the tech world, it can be difficult to decipher between the latest and greatest models of smart speakers, iPhones, e-readers and more.<figure><figcaption>From smartwatches to speakers, our top picks for the best tech gifts include products from Apple, Garmin, Samsung, Marshall and more.Illustration: Forbes / Photo: Courtesy</figcaption></figure>With that in mind, we turned to tech expert,Forbes 30 Under 30alum andCameocofounder Devon Townsend to help us select the very best tech gifts for everyone on your list. Townsend s approach to holiday shopping starts close to home.  If I m using a product and unexpectedly become obsessed with it, that becomes the thing that I buy as a gift because I know how well it works,  he says.  That recently happened with theGarmin Vívoactive 5 GPS Smartwatch after I bought it, I got addicted to running with it, and I ve since given it out a bunch of times as a gift. Same thing for theMarshall Tufton Speaker: I use mine constantly and it has incredible sound quality, so I ve given it at 10 different weddings. If you love something, why not share the joy? At Cameo, Townsend is also working hard to spread some holiday cheer. The platform sells personalized video messages from thousands of celebrities, athletes, musicians and social media influencers, with figures likePriscilla PresleyandDrew Breeson tap to send yuletide greetings to your loved ones near and far.  We also recently launchedCameo Kids, so now we have AI-powered 3D avatars that represent animated characters from popular TV shows likeBlippy,CoComelonandGracie's Corner,  says Townsend, who s planning to gift one of theCoComelonvideos to his 3-year-old nephew, along with a video from one of the stars ofThe Bachelor to a friend who s a fan of the reality TV show.  At the end of the day, the perfect gift is something that you know will put a smile on their face. Ahead, shop the best tech gifts, according to Townsend. And if you end up buying a gift or two for yourself, well, no judgment here.Best Tech Gifts, At A Glance:Best Affordable Tech Gift: Apple AirTagBest Splurge Tech Gift: Samsung The Frame 65-Inch QLED 4K UHD Smart TVBest Tablet Gift: Kindle PaperwhiteBest Headphones Gift: Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen)Best Tech Gift For Kids: Toniebox Audio Player Starter SetBest Smartwatch Gift: Garmin Vívoactive 5 GPS SmartwatchBest Speaker Gift: Marshall Tufton Portable Speaker<figure><figcaption>Apple</figcaption></figure>Apple AirTag<button>$27 At Amazon </button> My mom gave me some AirTags for Christmas, which has been super useful for finding my car and tracking other things that I often misplace,  says Townsend.  This is one of those gifts that I probably wouldn't have bought on my own, but it's been really helpful to have. <figure><figcaption>Best Buy</figcaption></figure>Samsung The Frame 65-Inch QLED 4K UHD Smart TV<button>$1600 At Samsung </button> I recently got the Frame TV for my living room. It's super thin, which is great for mounting on the wall, and then when it's turned off, it goes into art mode and shows the coolest photos. As a gift, it would check that box of something that they may never splurge on, but they ll fall in love with it once they see just how sleek it is. <figure><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure>Kindle Paperwhite<button>$125 At Amazon</button> I like to swap between three or four books at any given time, but when I travel I don't have room to carry them all, so I m a Kindle guy. I like to have a sci-fi book in the queue, a politics book and sometimes if I'm on a plane and exhausted, I want to read something a little easier.The Inner Game of Tenniswas a book that I recently liked a lot, andA Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joywas also super meaningful for me. <figure><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure>Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen)<button>Buy From Amazon</button> I have so many pairs of Apple AirPods because I always lose them, buy new ones, and then I find them again. When I m on a plane, I wear the AirPods Pro because they re noise-canceling and I feel like it unscrambles my brain for the flight. And then I wear the regularAirPodsfor going to the gym and running around town basically anywhere that you don t need noise-canceling capabilities. <figure><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure>Toniebox Audio Player Starter Set<button>$100 At Amazon</button> I bought my 3-year-old nephew a Toniebox, which is this little box where he can add characters to it to play music and stories,  says Townsend.  I got a lot of feedback from his parents on that one because he loved it so much. My brother sent pictures of him falling asleep to it. <figure><figcaption>Best Buy</figcaption></figure>Garmin Vívoactive 5 GPS Smartwatch<button>$300 At Amazon</button> I love to leave my phone at home and not have distractions in the gym or when I go for a run. I bought the Garmin Vívoactive Smartwatch because a friend recommended it to me, and I quickly got addicted to working out with it. It makes a great gift because it s less expensive than the Apple Watch Ultra and many other smartwatches, but works really well. <figure><figcaption>Marshall</figcaption></figure>Marshall Tufton Portable Speaker<button>$449 At Marshall</button> In the Cameo office, we useSonos speakers, which are really nice from a social perspective because if you're on Wi-Fi, you can jump right in and use it. But at home, I'm obsessed with my Marshall Tufton speaker. The sound quality is great, so I bring it everywhere. If I m showering, it comes in the bathroom; if I m working, it comes to my desk; if I go to the beach, it s in my bag. <figure><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure>Google Nest Smart Thermostat<button>$89 At Amazon</button> I really like the Nest thermostat and theNest cameras, which you can buy in bundles depending on how many you need. My dad also did a ton of research and recently convinced me to get theNest smoke detectors, too. It s convenient that they re all accessible in one app. <figure><figcaption>Best Buy</figcaption></figure>Ninja Air Fryer Max XL<button>$100 At Amazon</button> The big thing that's on my holiday wish list this year is anair fryer. I'm kind of in a battle over it because I like to live a minimalist lifestyle and buy as few new things as possible, but I've talked to so many friends that can t live without it. I've also been cooking a little bit more lately, so I think it might finally be time to play around with one. <figure><figcaption>DICK'S Sporting Goods</figcaption></figure>Garmin Approach R10 Golf Launch Monitor<button>$500 At Dick's Sporting Goods</button> This year, I've been really into golf. I looked at golf simulators, which are crazy expensive, but Garmin s R10 Golf Launch Monitor connects to the Garmin app and is a fraction of the price. I set it up with a golf mat in my house and can play simulated games on any golf course in the country. It's battery powered, so I've brought it to the driving range, too. <figure><figcaption>Cameo</figcaption></figure>Cameo Personalized Video<button>Buy From Cameo</button> A Cameo always makes a great gift, but the key is finding something that they will be obsessed with. I recently bought one fromTony P., who's a 25-year-old lifestyle influencer from Washington, D.C. that vlogs his day, and it s so fun to watch.Scott Hansonis another person that I've been into lately he's the NFL RedZone channel commentator, so would be great for any football fan. We also recently hadChester Cheetahjoin from Cheetos, which is an unexpected one! <figure><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure>iRobot Roomba s9+ Self Emptying Robot Vacuum<button>$572 At Amazon</button> When I moved into my apartment it came with aRoomba, and I've fallen in love with it. As I leave in the morning, I press the button and it does its thing, and when I come back it's charging itself like it never happened. It would be a phenomenal housewarming gift for anyone on your list that just got a new house or apartment. <figure><figcaption>Apple</figcaption></figure>Apple iPhone 15 Pro<button>Buy From Apple</button> The novelty has worn off for a lot of us with the iPhone. It's really just a slightly better camera every year, but I'm still excited for the latest one. It has USB-C charging and a whole new world of accessories that s going to come with it, so I cannot wait for it to get here. <figure><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure>Cheerwing Phantom Mini Remote Control Helicopter <button>Buy From Amazon</button> Sometimes it s the little gifts that you remember the most. One year for Christmas, I got a super-cheap helicopter that flies around the living room and I loved it so much. Those cheeky little gifts are always the coolest. My brother is also super intodrones. I haven't been convinced yet, but I think a lot of people would like that as a gift this year. <figure><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure>Liftmaster MyQ Key Free Smart Lock<button>Buy From Amazon</button> One thing I really like about my home is that I don't have keys; everything is opened with a keypad. For my garage door opener, I have the MyQ Smart Lock, which is nice and easy because it connects to your phone. For my house, I ve found that the Wi-Fi-connected door locks run out of battery quickly, so I use theSchlage keypad locksthat are relatively low-tech, but really great. <figure><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure>Sony ZV-1 II Vlog Camera<button>$799 At Amazon</button> I've been making more content lately, which used to be a huge part of my life before Cameo. I usually use my iPhone for filming, but this Sony ZV-1 II vlog camera is now at the top of my list because I ve heard from a few friends that it delivers.

Anything that uses a headphone jack is compatible with this device, so you can use it on your gym equipment and more. The AirFly here can connect to one set of earbuds. If your loved one likes to watch movies with friends and family on the plane, then you can opt for theAirFly Duo, which can connect to two sets of earbuds simultaneously.Tech editor Rebecca Isaacs says this is one of her favorite travel devices.  As someone who loves to use noise canceling while in flight, the AirFly SE allows me to use myBose QuietComfort Ultra headphonesto listen to my music and watch in-flight movies. If I forget to charge it, I appreciate that it lasts up to 20 hours before needing recharging, so I can use it on multiple flights.
