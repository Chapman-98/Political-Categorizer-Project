inching toward getting most of their money back FTX Trading, now being run by bankruptcy specialist John J  Ray III, announced this month thatcustomers can expect to recoup over 90% of the  distributable value  of the assets recovered from the failed enterprise But while it plans to direct the lion s share of the pie to customers who held investments on its international and U S  exchanges, it failed to specify how big that recovery pie might be  That depends on how many assets there actually are and when and how they can be distributed to creditors  Equity investors, mostly venture capitalists likeSequoia Capital and Temasek, will be wiped out under the plan, and lower-ranking creditors, including trading partners of the Alameda Research affiliate, are likely to suffer significant losses  Company insiders such as former General Counsel Ryne Miller and cofounders Gary Wang and Bankman-Fried, who is on trial for a litany of charges related to the bankruptcy including fraud and money laundering, areprecluded from recovering anything It turns out thatsmaller customers stand to reclaim most of their moneyas the company unearths previously missing assets and some investments appreciate in value  AForbestally of customer claims and visible FTX assets estimates that nearly $13 billion of the $15 billion in claims is accounted for  That should mean almost full recovery for account holders of FTX who withdrew less than $250,000 on FTX com and FTX US exchanges There s one big problem: The IRS claims that FTX owes it $44 billion for things like failing to withhold payroll taxes as administrative claims, which at least in theory may take precedence over lost customer funds, overwhelming the company s visible assets MORE Bankman-Fried Stars In His Own
