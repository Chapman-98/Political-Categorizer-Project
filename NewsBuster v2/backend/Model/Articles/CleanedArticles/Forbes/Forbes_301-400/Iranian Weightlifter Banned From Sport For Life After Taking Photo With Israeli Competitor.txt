Athletes who compete on the same stage respect each other and appreciate the special sporting activity of weightlifting. Shaking hands with a competitor who won or lost is in our eyes minimal values to respect him. Key BackgroundIran does not recognize the legitimacy of Israel as a state, and multiple Iranian leaders have called for the state of Israel to be dismantled and have threatened military action against the country. Israel has pushed back against Iran s apparent nuclear ambitions, while Iran has criticized Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians whom Israel is locked into a decades-long bloody conflict with andprovides supportto insurgent group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip and is deemed a terrorist organization by the United States.Surprising FactThis isn t the first conflict to erupt due to Iran s policy of forbidding competition with Israel: The International Judo Federationbanned Iranfrom the sport for four years in 2021 due to the policy. Athletes from other countries have also dealt with tensions due to geopolitical conflicts. In 2022, the Wimbledon Tennis Championship banned Russian and Belarussian players because of the invasion of Ukraine. In tennis tournaments where Russians and Belarussians have competed, Ukrainian players like Elina Svitolinahave refused to shaketheir hands after the match. At the 2024 Olympics in Paris, Russia and Belarus will not be allowed to form official Olympic teams, though individual athletes will be able to compete as neutral athletes.TangentRajai and Svirsky both competed well at the weightlifting championships, earning silver and bronze medals respectively, though they were competing in a non-professional competition for "legends" of the sport.Further ReadingIran: Weightlifter Mostafa Rajai banned for photo with Israeli(BBC)Iran bans weightlifter for life after he shakes Israeli s hand on podium(Al Jazeera)
