It s pretty clear thatAI can accurately detect disease, and it s getting to the point that it can robustly predict disease progression,  Chris Mansi, the neurosurgeon who is also the company founder and CEO, toldForbes.An alumnus of the 2021 Forbes Next Billion-Dollar Startups list, Viz.ai has raised a total of $254 million from firms that include Insight Partners, Kleiner Perkins, Scale Venture Partners and Tiger Global at a valuation of $1.2 billion.Perhaps more importantly, the seven-year-old company has now signed on more than 1,500 hospitals, including the Cleveland Clinic, Mount Sinai, Tenet Healthcare and HCA,that cover roughly two-thirds of the U.S. population. It has also become the rare AI company to receive both approval by the FDA for its algorithms and by Medicare for reimbursement.But medical AI is more regulated and harder to break into than some other areas of technology, and competition has become tougher since Viz started. Having been accepted by hospitals for its image-based AI, Viz is now expanding into generative AI in a previously unannounced move that includes a pilot program with Mount Sinai and other hospitals.At the same time, Viz has begun working with drug companies and medical-device manufacturers that are looking for ways to launch their products faster and more efficiently.Ultimately, Mansi hopes that thecombination of image-based AI and generative AI will allow it to detect 100 diseases.WHY IT MATTERS  Medicine has gotten increasingly complex, and there are big gaps in both rural healthcare and urban hospitals,  saysForbessenior editor Amy Feldman.  Viz s algorithms can help cut through the complexity, saving crucial time in emergencies and helping make sure patients get appropriate treatment.Says Mansi:  We think every major disease could benefit and it will become just the norm in healthcare.
