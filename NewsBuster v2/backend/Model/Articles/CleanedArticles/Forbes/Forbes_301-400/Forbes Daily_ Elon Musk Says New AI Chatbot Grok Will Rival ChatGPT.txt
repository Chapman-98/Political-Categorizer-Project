So a California startup from two leading chemists, including a Nobel laureate, is designing a new type of tank made with nanomaterials that aims to be cheaper and safer than any currently in use and hold more hydrogen, too.H2MOF hopes to sell its next-generation hydrogen tanks sometime after 2024 to heavy-duty vehicle makers with plans to offer zero-emission fuel cell vehicles. It argues that in addition to holding fuel inside the vehicles, these tanks will also provide a better way to ship the fuel by truck or train as truckmakers transition toward using hydrogen to power carbon-free fleets. Storing more fuel at lower pressure means much less cost. CEO and cofounder Samer Taha toldForbesfrom Dubai that switching from high-pressure tanks to its technology could save an estimated $12,000 annually in energy expenses to operate a fuel cell transit bus, for example.Hydrogen is heavily used for oil refining, fertilizer production and in the chemical industry, but most is made using steam to pull the element from natural gas, emitting carbon dioxide in the process. Unless startups like H2MOF or Verne, aForbes30 Under 30 alum that s also working on new types of tanks, can find better ways to move hydrogen around or use it in vehicles,its potential to replace climate-warming fossil fuels will be limited.  Right now, hydrogen is pumped through pipelines in Texas and California, but those pipelines have to be made of materials that can withstand embrittlement and cracking that  slippery  hydrogen causes. Liquifying it is an easier way to transport the fuel, but is even more energy-intensive than storing it under high pressure.The Biden administration has provided unprecedented funding and support for clean hydrogen, last month announcing $7 billion for a network of hubs across the U.S. to scale up its production and use. If we can make a contribution to thestorage and transportation issue, it will unlock real demand and it will unlock real adoption of hydrogen,  Taha said.WHY IT MATTERS  New ways to make clean, carbon, free, hydrogen are spooling up, aided by an unprecedented level of federal support,  saysForbes senior editor Alan Ohnsman.  But there s still abig challenge in how hydrogen producers can move the fuelfrom where it s needed. A breakthrough in hydrogen storage would be a much-needed game changer.

The changes follow regulators  efforts to crack down on mentholand other sweet-flavored tobacco products:About 10%: The share of high school students that reported current use of e-cigarettes, down from 14.1% the previous year6.6%: The percentage of middle schoolers who reported current use of any tobacco product, up from 4.5% the previous yearJust over 2.5 million: The number of students who reported tobacco use last yearSTRATEGY AND SUCCESSWarren Buffett s mentor, Columbia University Professor Benjamin Graham, counseled defensive investorsnever to pay more than 15 times earnings or 1.5 times book value for a stock. Graham, the  father of value investing,  believed that it was better to be conservative and to select only stocks priced by a margin of safety below their intrinsic value.Here are 12 stocks that make the grade, including Cal-Maine Foods and RMR Group.QUIZAmazon will close yet another set of brick-and-mortar stores this week after about 17 months of operation.What type of stores are impacted by the latest closure?A.
