Tennis Stars Call Monaco Home<figure><figcaption>Home Court Advantage: Novak Djokovic has won two Monte-Carlo Masters tournaments in his spectacular career JULIAN FINNEY/GETTY

celebrities and athletes  And it s easy to see why: The microstate on the French Riviera enjoys more than 300 sunny days a year, it s a short flight from several European capitals, and it has access

money, he ll owe nothing to the Mon√©gasque government But the IRS won t be as forgiving WHY IT MATTERS  A fundamental principle of both U S  and international taxation,  explains Jerry August, co-chair of Fox Rothschild s international taxation and wealth planning practice group,  is that a jurisdiction has the right to alwaystax you on your labor if your labor is performed in that country
