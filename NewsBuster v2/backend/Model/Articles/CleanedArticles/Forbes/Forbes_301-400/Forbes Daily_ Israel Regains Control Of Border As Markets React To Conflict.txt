wealth transfer of all time In the U S  today, according to the Federal Reserve, Boomers control a stunning $75 trillion and their elders another $18 trillion of the nation s $141 trillion in total household wealth  Yes, some middle-class retirees will spend their savings and die broke  But wealth in the U S  has become increasingly concentrated, with the richest 1% holding 31% of net assets meaning most one-percenters will leave plenty to their children, grandchildren and favorite causes The estate tax, which used to be a real revenue raiser, has been eviscerated by a quarter-century of political, regulatory and court decisions and the ingenuity of private lawyers One way the rich have long been applauded foravoiding taxes is through philanthropy far easier to love than a loophole  Four members of The Forbes 400 shared the moves they ve made tocement their legacies and ensure their wealth goes to familyand favored causes: Nike cofounder Phil Knight; Charles Koch, the free-market libertarian worth $54 5 billion; Harold Hamm, the truck driver turned fracking king worth $25 2 billion; and TV whiz cum internet entrepreneur Barry Diller Last year, Koch gave $4 3 billion of nonvoting Koch stock to Believe in People, a Wichita-based not-for-profit created under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code, a broad category of  social welfare  organizations that includes everything from volunteer fire companies to the NRA and the ACLU In contrast to a traditional 501(c)(3) charity, a C4 can own an entire company indefinitely and (so long as these activities support its principal purpose) engage in an unlimited amount of lobbying; get directly involved in politics; and benefit private individuals  In 2015, Congress made a crucial tweak to the law that a Koch lobbyist promoted which exempted transfers to a C4 from the gift tax  So a living billionaire (or anyone else) can thereforegive a C4 a big gift of highly appreciated stock without paying either gift or capital gains tax While a few billionaires have put their entire companies into C4s, Koch s gift to Believe in People is the largest, in dollar terms, to a C4 that we know of WHY IT MATTERS  America's billionaires are getting old, and there's a theoretical 40% estate tax that could drastically limit what they're able to leave to their families and favorite causes,  saysForbes wealth reporter Matt Durot   Most of America's richest people have found a way around that problem and the billionaires we spoke to help explain how  MOREExclusive: Charles Koch Has Given More Than $5 Billion Of His Stock To Two
