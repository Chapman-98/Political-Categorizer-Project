Will Cost America More Than $20 Billion<figure><figcaption>U S  tourism officials are pining for the return of Chinese touristsILLUSTRATION BY CECILIA ZHANG FOR FORBES; PHOTOS BY VIEWSTOCK/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>TOPLINE  U S  tourism officials are pining for the return of Chinese tourists, by far the biggest spenders among global travelers  Before Covid,  says U S  Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo,  as many as three million Chinese travelers visited the United States annually, contributing more than $30 billion to the U S  economy   This year, fewer than 850,000 Chinese will travel here, according to the National Travel & Tourism Office That68% drop in traveler volume translates to more than $20 billionthat Chinese visitors will not spend in the U S  this year The fall-off in Chinese tourists has taken an especially big toll on West Coast cities such as San Francisco, where 518,000 Chinese visitors injected over $1 2 billion into the local economy during the year before the pandemic In that context of global competition, tourism officials acknowledge that theU S  recovery has been slower than expected  This while at the same time Canada is at 102% of their recovery,  says Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the U S  Travel Association   Clearly travelers are making a decision, and too many are deciding not to come to the United States  Freeman points to Canada s decision in June to waive visa requirements for 13 different countries for whom the U S  still has requirements  Appointments for visa interviews for inbound travel to the U S  can often take more than a year and sometimes more than two years AndAmerica s gun violence is the No  1 disincentive to visit the countrynamed by Chinese, Australian and Canadian travelers, according to Erin Francis-Cummings, president and CEO of travel industry research firm Destination Analysts The U S -China trade war also brought an escalation of harsh rhetoric between Washington and Beijing as well as a series of tit-for-tat punitive measures that impacted tourism   Meanwhile, as U S  tourism organizations wait eagerly for inbound Chinese travel to rebound, they are tasked with trying to replace the lost tens of billions of dollars with tourists from elsewhere  Onesilver lining has been India,whose travelers have already returned to the U S  at pre-pandemic levels WHY IT MATTERS  The $855 billion global travel industry is becoming ever more competitive as countries vie for the hearts and minds of international travelers,  saysForbes reporter Suzanne Rowan Kelleher   While the United States remains the most desired destination in the world, some tourism officials fret that the country may be losing its competitive edge  Of particular concern: Chinese tourists, the world s highest-spending travelers, have not returned to the U S  in expected numbers, causing a $20 billion hole that must be filled by travelers from other countries  FACTS AND COMMENTSSince Lionel Messi
