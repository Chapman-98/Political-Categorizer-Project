Stephen the Schmuck King!" a self-described Trump supporter chimed in This is not the first time that King has called out Greene online  He previously criticized her on X was after she appeared on Tucker Carlson's show Tucker on X in December to discuss the state of U S  politics During her appearance, Greene criticized the White House claiming that "Washington doesn't care about normal Americans and normal American ideas and normal American values "Greene shared a clip of the interview, captioning it: "If you don't fund the foreign wars, if you don't wear their flag, and if you don't have a sign outside your office door, you're going against Washington, against the Pentagon, and against the military industrial complex  And you will pay the price "King slammed Greene's stance by retweeting her post and adding: "Putin loves fools like you "He also criticized Greene on November 5 when she posted inaccurate information amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict "Israel is literally dominating in their war with Hamas after being brutally attacked killing thousands of innocent people, and not one single American dollar has been spent on that war yet  Just think about that," she wrote on X Plenty of people were quick to fire back at the outspoken congresswoman, including King: "Are you tripping? We've given them aid and armaments for decades "Link to Image
