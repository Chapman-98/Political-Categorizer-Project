Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson was booed by members of the audience of The View after expressing regret for his endorsement of President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.Boos were heard on Friday morning after the airing of a short clip from a recent Fox News interview with the actor and professional wrestling star, who is set to return to the ring for the first time in eight years at this weekend's WWE WrestleMania event.Johnson said that he was not "happy with the state of America" in the clip and revealed that he would not be endorsing Biden in this year's election because he feels his 2020 endorsement had caused "division.""The endorsement that I made years ago with Biden was one that I thought was the best decision for me at that time," Johnson said. "Am I going to do that again this year? That answer's no, I'm not going to do that.""I realized what that caused back then was something that tears me up in my guts—back then and now—which is division," he added.The View crowd responded to Johnsons remarks by loudly booing, seemingly taking co-host Joy Behar and the show's other co-hosts by surprise with their overwhelmingly negative response."Should I pay any attention to someone who gives an interview on Fox where they lie every day?" Behar asked the crowd, before questioning whether celebrities should "endorse public figures" or "keep their politics to themselves."Some in the audience could be heard responding "no" after Behar asked if celebrities should make endorsements. A short time later, the crowd made their opinions on former President Donald Trump's 2024 candidacy clear after co-host Sunny Hostin weighed in."I do think we're living in a time where we have someone [Trump] running for president that is an existential threat to democracy," Hostin said, prompting loud cheers and applause from the audience."Now is the time—if you have a platform—you must be active, you must speak out," she added, drawing additional applause.Newsweek reached out for comment to Johnson's publicist via email on Friday.While endorsing Biden in 2020, Johnson described himself as a "political independent and centrist" who was making his first public endorsement due to the outcome of the election being "critical.""As a political independent and centrist for many years, I've voted for Democrats in the past and as well as Republican," Johnson wrote in a social media post at the time. "In this critical election, I believe Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the best to lead our country, and as my first ever (public) Presidential endorsement, I proudly endorse them for the presidential office of our United States."During his Fox News interview, Johnson did not express support for Trump nor did he indicate whether or not he feels that the outcome of this year's election is as important as in 2020.Johnson said during a November 2023 interview on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast that he could not think of any friends who explicitly support Biden, while lamenting that the American political divide was "unhealthy" for individuals and "just in terms of humanity."Link to Image
