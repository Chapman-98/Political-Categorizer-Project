Roughly 1 in 4 Democrats is backing former GOP Governor Larry Hogan's Senate bid in Maryland, one of the most Democratic states in the country, according to new polling Hogan, who ran the state from 2015 to 2023, holds a narrow lead over the two top Democratic candidates, Representative David Trone and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, according to a Goucher College survey released Tuesday Maryland is not usually viewed as a particularly competitive state, as heavily Democratic areas near Washington, D C , and Baltimore typically keep it out of Republicans' reach In the 2020 presidential election, President Joe Biden won the state by 33 points, giving him more than 65 percent of the vote, one of his strongest showings—and it is not expected to become competitive on the presidential level this year But Hogan brings a high level of name recognition, and his brand of more moderate politics—and staunch opposition to Donald Trump—has historically played well for him among Maryland Democrats, many of whom have backed his gubernatorial campaigns in 2014 and 2018 The poll, which surveyed 800 Maryland voters from March 19 to 24, found that in a head-to-head race against Trone, 43 percent of respondents would back Hogan, while 42 percent would vote for Trone  In that matchup, 24 percent of Democrats said they would vote for Hogan If Alsobrooks wins the Democratic nomination, Hogan's lead grows to 44 percent over her 40 percent  In this scenario, 25 percent of Democrats said they would support Hogan Gina Ford, a spokesperson for the Alsobrooks campaign, responded to the poll, which she said shows Alsobrooks "quickly closing the gap in the primary" and entering April "with clear momentum" as voters are "just getting to know Angela on the airwaves "Ford told Newsweek that Maryland is a "tale of two states when it comes to voting in gubernatorial and presidential years," which will bring out more Democratic voters "The candidate who can beat Larry Hogan is the candidate who can energize those voters, including young voters and people of color  Angela Alsobrooks is the candidate who can and will turn out the necessary Democrats to win in November," Ford said Newsweek also reached out to the Hogan and Trone campaigns for comment via email Democrats are facing a potentially difficult year in the Senate that threatens to wipe out their control of Congress' upper chamber  They must defend Democratic-held seats in two Republican-leaning states, Ohio and Montana, as well as several battleground states—Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin With a slim majority of only 51 Senate seats, Democrats have little room for error  If they lose one seat, Senate control would be determined by whichever party holds the White House, as the vice president serves as the tiebreaker in Senate votes  If they lose two seats, they would lose their majority Hogan's candidacy could put Democrats on the defense in a safely Democratic state as they fight to maintain their Senate majority in more competitive states  Other polls have similarly found Hogan with a lead over his Democratic rivals An earlier poll from The Washington Post and the University of Maryland Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement found a more substantial lead for Hogan In that survey, he led Trone by 12 points and Alsobrooks by 14 points  It was conducted from March 5 to 12 among 1,004 likely voters Update 4/2/2024, 9:03 a m  ET: This story was updated with comments from Gina Ford, a spokesperson for the Angela Alsobrooks campaign Link to Image
