Joe Rogan didn't mince words when talking about The View, calling the talk show a "rabies-infested hen house" on the latest episode of his podcast The Wednesday, April 3, episode of The Joe Rogan Experience featured guest Coleman Hughes, who recently got into a heated debate with The View cohost Sunny Hostin when he appeared on the show to discuss his new book, The End of Race Politics: Arguments for a Colorblind America "That's been overwhelming my past couple days," Hughes told Rogan on the UFC commentator's podcast, speaking of his viral moment with Hostin — during which she debated his ideology about race and socioeconomic status in America "When I was on there I really had no idea how it was gonna land with the audience," Hughes told Rogan on Wednesday, explaining that he "didn't know" and "still don't really know" who Hostin is "I wasn't expecting her to ambush me in that way and attack my character in that way," Hughes said  (While Hostin argued against Hughes' theory on the show, she also made the claim that some believed he was being used as a "pawn" by the right wing, to which several of her cohosts appeared to disagree )Rogan — who later called Hostin "intelligent but ideologically captured" in his conversation with Hughes — gave his own thoughts on The View "It is the show that people love to hate," he laughed  "They get so much hate-watching, and hate-watching viral clips of them saying ridiculous things ""It is a rabies-infested hen house," Rogan said of the all women-led talk show, which also stars Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg, Sara Haines and Alyssa Farah Griffin  (While he didn't name names, Rogan also called several of the moderators "dull-minded ")Furthermore, Rogan claimed that "the real fans of The View" — those "that are like, 'These ladies are on point,'" he said — "They like, can't leave the house  They're immobile "Ultimately, Rogan posited, The View is "a very strange show but it's fun to watch  It's just fun to watch them "Rogan, for his part, has made headlines for years due to his own controversial viewpoints and bold statements  His podcast reach is currently unmatched, with nearly 15 million Spotify subscribers Link to Image
