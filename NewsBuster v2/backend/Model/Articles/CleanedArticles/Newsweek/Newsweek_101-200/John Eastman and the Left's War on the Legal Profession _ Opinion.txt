John Eastman is a lawyer, legal scholar, and a friend  A former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, candidate for California attorney general, and dean of Chapman University School of Law, I got to know John during my week-long 2018 legal fellowship with the Claremont Institute, which he oversaw  We have stayed in touch and done at least one event together for Claremont since that time Unfortunately, since the 2020 presidential election, John has been put through the wringer more than just about anyone in American public life He was forced to retire from the law school where he was a longtime constitutional law professor and even dean  He was let go by the University of Colorado's Benson Center for Western Civilization, where he was a visiting scholar  Armed Stasi—sorry, FBI—agents accosted him in a parking lot and seized his phone without a warrant  He has been suspended from academic conferences and lost board seats  He and his wife have endured death threats, spikes in their driveway, and threatening graffiti in their neighborhood  He has been debanked by Bank of America and the USAA  He is being criminally prosecuted by scandal-ridden Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis  And last week, State Bar Court of California Judge Yvette Roland devoted 128 pages to explaining why he should lose his law license All this because John had the chutzpah to do what every law school student is taught to do in legal ethics class: defend and zealously advocate for one's client, no matter how unpopular or even disreputable that client may be  In this case, John's unpopular client was a high-profile one: former President Donald Trump There has been an astronomical amount of misinformation about John's activities in the weeks leading up to the Jan  6, 2021 U S  Capitol jamboree, as well as the legal advice that he offered his high-profile client during that time  The corporate media and the Democrat-lawfare complex typically speak of John's legal advice as encouraging the "overturning of an election" or "fomenting an insurrection," but such hyperbolic talk is irresponsible and wildly off-base John acquitted himself well in a compelling essay he penned for Claremont's American Mind online journal on Jan  18, 2021, titled "Setting the Record Straight on the POTUS 'Ask '" His 12th Amendment argument about the vice president's more active role in certifying the states' slates of electors and his accompanying argument regarding the constitutional dubiousness of the Electoral Count of 1887 might not be correct (although it could be), but it is well within the bound of plausible, non-frivolous legal argumentation an attorney can (indeed, should) press upon an embattled client  That is doubly so here, because the U S  Supreme Court has never authoritatively interpreted the relevant 12th Amendment provision  Countless legal arguments more frivolous than this are advanced every day in courtrooms across America Nor is John Eastman the only man being prosecuted, and possibly disbarred, for his legal activity after the 2020 election  Former U S  Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark is also being prosecuted in Georgia, and he was just found by the District of Columbia Bar to have violated an ethics rule, which might lead to his own disbarment there—all stemming from an internal Department of Justice memo that Clark never even sent Once upon a time, the American Left understood the moral imperative of ensuring that all Americans have adequate access to legal representation, no matter one's popularity in the eyes of the government or societal elites  Indeed, the definitive American example of such unpopular legal representation actually dates back to before the United States was even independent: In 1770, a young lawyer named John Adams, the man who would become the young republic's second president, took it upon himself to defend the British soldiers accused of killing five colonists at the Boston Massacre  Years later, in his dotage, Adams reflected that this was "one of the most gallant, generous, manly, and disinterested actions of my whole life, and one of the best pieces of service I ever rendered my country "Presumably, Fani Willis and Judge Roland would have preferred to see John Adams tarred and feathered for his treachery  One also cannot help but wonder how they might have viewed the NAACP's legal representation in the Deep South during the days of Jim Crow The ultimate aim of those Jacobins prosecuting and disbarring lawyers for having the temerity to practice the legal profession is clear: the subordination of the rule of law to the Jacobins' own friend/enemy-level politics, and the cowing into submission of those lawyers who would so much as consider representing a high-profile Republican client or work in a Republican Department of Justice  Ironically, and without any hint of self-awareness, they do all this in the name of "our democracy "Josh Hammer is
