House Speaker Mike Johnson's letter about foreign funding bills sparked a new flood of Republican backlash on social media on Wednesday It has been months since the Senate passed a $95-billion funding package which would give aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, money to Israel in its war with Hamas, and funds for Taiwan to combat Chinese aggression However, the House has yet to act on the bill and instead, Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told colleagues in a letter on Wednesday that the language of three separate funding bills will be posted today "After significant member feedback and discussion, the House Rules Committee will be posting soon today the text of three bills that will fund America's national security interests and allies in Israel, the Indo-Pacific, and Ukraine, including a loan structure for aid, and enhanced strategy and accountability," Johnson wrote in the letter that has circulated on social media "These will be brought to the floor under a structured rule that will allow for an amendment process, alongside a fourth bill that includes the REPO Act, TikTok bill, sanctions and other measures to confront Russia, China, and Iran "The REPO Act refers to the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act  It allows the president of the United States to confiscate sovereign assets of the Russian Federation that are directly or indirectly owned by the government, states the Lawfare website The House speaker said that the committee will also post text for a bill on border security that "includes the core components of H R 2," which is a piece of tough immigration legislation that passed on the House last May, but was blocked by the Democratic-led Senate "By posting text of these bills as soon as they are completed, we will ensure time for a robust amendment process  We expect the vote on final passage on these bills to be on Saturday evening," Johnson added in the letter Tensions between Johnson and members of his own party in the House have already been high with Rep  Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia introducing a motion to vacate him from the speaker seat last month and Rep  Thomas Massie, from Kentucky, writing on social media on Tuesday that he told Johnson that he is co-sponsoring Greene's motion Johnson said he is not resigning and called any attempt to oust him as House speaker "absurd " Newsweek has reached out to Johnson's office via email for comment Johnson's new letter seemed to cause more backlash on how he is handling foreign funding and the U S -Mexico border, which is at the heart of Greene's motion to vacate Reacting to Johnson's letter on Wednesday, Greene wrote on X, formerly Twitter, "News flash for Speaker Johnson, we have already passed HR2, the Senate has it and refuses to secure our border, they want 5,000 illegals per day to come in "The House passed $14 Billion for Israel aid in Nova and the Senate refuses to pass it  You, Speaker Johnson, voted against $300 million for Ukraine before we gave you the gavel along with the majority of Republicans, no one understands why it is now your top priority to give Ukraine $60 billion more dollars "Greene was referencing a border deal that previously failed in the Senate, which would have enabled U S  Department of Homeland Security officials to detain and deport migrants if there is an average of 5,000 or more migrant encounters a day over seven consecutive days or if there are 8,500 or more encounters in a single day "You are seriously out of step with Republicans by continuing to pass bills dependent on Democrats  Everyone sees through this "Sen  J D  Vance, an Ohio Republican, wrote, "Rumored course of action in the House: Combine Ukraine and Israel aid, with other Biden boondoggles  Send it all to the Senate as a combined package  Then let the House vote on a fake border security package that has no chance  Betrayal  And stupid politics to boot ""The Republican Speaker of the House is seeking a rule to pass almost $100 billion in foreign aid—while unquestionably, dangerous criminals, terrorists, & fentanyl pour across our border  The border 'vote' in this package is a watered-down dangerous cover vote  I will oppose," Rep  Chip Roy, a Texas Republican said "Anything less than tying Ukraine aid to real border security fails to live up to @SpeakerJohnson's own words just several weeks ago  Our constituents demand—and deserve—more from us," Rep  Scott Perry, representing a Pennsylvania district, wrote Former Republican congressman from Illinois Adam Kinzinger, who has been critical of the far-right faction in his party, slammed Johnson for not doing enough on CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta on Wednesday "The fact that we are six months, frankly, after we should have passed aid to Ukraine, and three months after the Senate did, and it has been sitting in the House  Don't call yourself a 'wartime speaker' if you're unwilling to do what's needed to be done in a wartime," Kinzinger said Kinzinger's comments come after Johnson called himself a "wartime speaker" during a press conference on Tuesday Link to Image
