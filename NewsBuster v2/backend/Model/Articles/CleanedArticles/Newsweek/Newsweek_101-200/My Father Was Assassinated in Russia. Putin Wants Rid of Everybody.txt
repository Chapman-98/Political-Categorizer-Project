My father, Boris Nemtsov, published a book in 2007 titled Confessions of a Rebel, and its preface was a manifesto in which he said he would enter Russian politics again He thought Vladimir Putin was fundamentally wrong in the path he had chosen for Russia, a disastrous one that was moving away from democracy to rebuild an autocracy  He felt something had to be done to stop this At that time, my father's message was not heard  Part of the problem, which was not unique to Russia, was that economic conditions were favorable After Russia's painful economic transition in the 1990s, Putin was very lucky that commodity prices, including oil and gas, were high and the markets were booming  So people weren't paying much attention to politics They focused on their private lives and new consumer power, able to buy not only basic amenities but durable goods, cars, and so on  Life was relatively good for many Russians, though not all  They credited Putin's economic policies for this When my father was speaking out, many Russians thought they were fine, and so what was the problem? As long as they could enjoy their lives, living and working and opening businesses, traveling and using credit lines, they were happy enough In 2005, I graduated from university and started working for an asset management company that my ex-husband founded  I was interested in financial markets, and the Russian stock market looked really promising at the time, with a bunch of IPOs I had a very normal life  I didn't expect that to change quite so dramatically There were two main causes of this major turning point  The first was Russia's unimaginable annexation of Crimea in 2014, which really worried me about the future of my country  I firmly believed that Putin had crossed the so-called red line The second was my father's assassination the following year I wasn't an expert in politics, although I followed it of course  But I met my father before he was killed to warn him that I thought the personal risks for him were much higher after Putin took Crimea I told my father to think seriously about fleeing Russia because of my gut feeling, my intuition about what was happening He smiled and said: "I will tell you when it gets really dangerous "What bewildered me so much was the patriotic euphoria that spread all across Russia, and Moscow was no exception I was working as a journalist at RBC, a privately owned television network for business, like the Russian version of Bloomberg  The people there were quite modern  Many had a Western outlook and, I thought, were able to critically assess everything But no  Most colleagues were happy with Putin's actions in Crimea  I wondered: Are they all crazy? I just couldn't understand  It's a very strange and uncomfortable feeling when everyone around you is for something and you are against it That's why I fully understand now how public perceptions are shaped  When everybody around you is saying "that's great", it's very difficult to say: "No  This is not great "In the subsequent war in eastern Ukraine, our television network, though still controlled by a private owner, gave it toothless coverage I was much more opinionated in my coverage  I was focused on the national economy, which was affected by sanctions because of the war, but I had a political position against the war and showed my teeth  My editors and supervisors didn't like it My father was assassinated at around midnight on February 27, 2015  I was at my rented apartment within walking distance from my father's home  I was already in bed and I switched off my phone My mother was also at my place because we were planning a trip to Italy the following day  Her phone was still on, and she got a call from a friend  She was the first one to learn the news She started to cry and yell, and I woke up  She entered my room and said: "Your father was shot and he is dead "That's how I learned about his assassination  But I didn't believe it at first  I turned on my phone and got a lot of messages from friends and colleagues offering their condolences at the same time I wanted to confirm the news and started to read my own media outlet, RBC, but I still didn't believe it  I finally believed the news when I saw it breaking on the CNN website Afterward, we dressed up and went to the scene of the murder, but we arrived quite late I believe Putin holds ultimate, first responsibility for all major political assassinations in Russia, not only my father's, but also for Alexei Nalany's, Anna Politkovskaya's, and so on It could never have happened if Putin hadn't approved of it If we compare how Putin perceived Navalny and my father Boris Nemtsov: He hated my father, but he hated Navalny so much more This isn't something that has never happened in any other country  Any dictator or autocrat tries to get rid of his political enemies and opponents I was right in my assessment of the state of Russia in 2015  After my father's assassination, I decided to leave the country  Many people just didn't understand why  They said I was exaggerating the risks, and to wait and see what happens Then in 2022, with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of Russians were forced to leave the country and they didn't have time to prepare I left Russia when I was 31 years old  I'm almost 40  Many people left Russia in their late 30s  It's easier for me now because I've already spent nine years in Europe  I made a wise decision Everything has changed in my life since then  When I left Russia, I started life from scratch  I worked as a journalist for Germany's public broadcaster, Deutsche Welle, and interviewed politics and world leaders, mainly from the post-Soviet space I hadn't been involved in politics or social activism before  But I strongly believe I made a moral choice First, to be very vocal about the quality of the investigation into my father's murder  I was highly critical of the investigation, and clear on what I believed the motive to be And second, I wanted to carry on my father's political legacy, so I established the Boris Nemtsov Foundation for Freedom in Germany Before my father's assassination, my life was normal  It's not anymore Over the last nine years, the risks have substantially increased for people both inside Russia and outside of it We learned recently of the violent attack in Lithuania on Leonid Volkov, who was Navalny's chief of staff and his closest political ally So even if even I wanted to quit, I cannot  I have no doubts that I am a target of the Russian state, but I'm not first in the line I am very visible  Our opponents wouldn't believe that I had just disappeared Disappearing won't decrease the risks  Probably, if you are less visible, it might increase the risk  You never know Also, I have a lot of responsibility to the foundation  I created it with my own hands and I don't want to abandon it  The foundation is one of my life's biggest accomplishments When I learned that Navalny had been killed in prison, I was at the Munich Security Conference, and one of the things I said was: Guys, our risks are now much higher than they were a week ago I cannot do anything about that  Safety is not granted  But I'm not trembling I had a business meeting when I got a call from Olga Shorina, the co-founder of the Nemtsov Foundation, in Munich  She told me Navalny had died It was shocking  I knew Navalny and he was a personal friend  I had no doubts that Putin ordered his assassination  He sent him to a very remote penal colony  So that appears to have been the plan You're just always in this situation  I was also thinking about other political prisoners  The reality is that Putin is likely to get rid of everybody We are now in what I would describe as very dark times for Ukraine, for Russia, and for Russian dissidents  I see no good outcome in the foreseeable future In order to be able to work, you must be very, very resilient Hearing the news about Navalny was a double blow  My grandmother had passed away on February 14  On the Friday, when I learned about Navalny, it was my grandmother's funeral in Russia, but I couldn't go Public support for Ukraine is criminalized in Russia  There is a special clause in the criminal code of Russia that implies a long prison term for discrediting the Russian Armed Forces But it's defined so broadly, you could theoretically get seven years in jail for saying something like "Zelensky is a cool guy" From day one, I have been very vocal about the nature of this brutal invasion of Ukraine  So I can't go to Russia  It's too high risk, and I don't want to spend my life in prison  It would be a waste of time, and not the best thing I can do for my country You're just afraid of turning on your phone Putin and his system are putting more and more pressure on you, creating these unbearable conditions in which very few people can survive psychologically First and foremost, we don't have an opposition  Please do not apply a democratic framework to analyzing our Russian reality right now We have a resistance formed of journalists, politicians, intellectual leaders, and so on  Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation is still the strongest and most organized political force Most people are in exile  I don't know about hope for an opposition  But what can we do right now? And what is Putin trying to prevent us from doing?We can still shape popular perceptions through online platforms, including YouTube  Blocking YouTube was an option for the Kremlin, but Putin's team came up with a smarter plan to destroy the business model of the biggest channels Russia has adopted a law that prohibits placing adverts on any channels, not only on YouTube, run by what it defines as "foreign agents"  The vast majority of our major journalists are foreign agents by this definition They cannot carry on producing the content because they have no sources of income, which is a big challenge But you have to try all the time to speak to Russians inside and outside of the country, and to explain to them what's wrong and shape popular perceptions I feel we do not talk enough about problems that are crucial for Russians  The state of the economy, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and so on  We must find a new approach for talking about these issues in an appealing manner We are currently trying to explain very broad concepts of liberal values and democracy, but I'm not sure a lot of Russian people are really into that Of course, we should be very aware of the current situation and to shape the understanding of this, and present a possible vision for the future of Russia In Navalny's terms, this was the "beautiful Russia of tomorrow"—and this is something we should put a lot of work into right now I would not say that there is no hope  The risks are very high, but that doesn't mean you should give up, or you end up doing nothing As Navalny once said, echoing a famous quote: "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil, is for good people to do nothing  So don't do nothing "I still think change might come from within Russia  The role of emigrants will probably be limited to providing assistance and advice rather than being a game-changer We'll see new leaders inside our country, though I'm not sure if they will be democratic or undemocratic Defeating Putin is in the whole world's interest  He represents a threat to global security  But I don't see a clear strategy for that  I saw tactical moves, but not a strategy for Russia and the existential threat it poses, including in the E U I want to hear the strategy  What does the plan involve? And what is the preferred outcome of this war?For example, in Germany, there are endless discussions on whether they should send long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine or not Of course they should  It's out of the question  But what would they like to see as the preferred outcome? This is foundational for defining your strategy If you want Ukraine to win, then you have to put your economy on a war footing; to produce more weapons and ammunition, among other measures Another thing that surprises me in Europe is the number of regular people who are living like it's peacetime  No, there's no peace in Europe anymore  We know what Putin is up to The first thing on my agenda going forward is to survive Second, speaking as the leader of the Nemtsov Foundation, we must preserve our human capital, helping exiles to integrate and build their careers And also we must reduce our reliance on foreign donors and aid to keep the institutions of Russian civil society alive  We should build bridges with business people in exile who are against Putin and the war  We need our own sources of funding First and foremost, the media: We need infrastructure and vibrant Russian-language media outlets to help get our message through to Russia so its communication with the outside world is not cut off My most recent project is the Venture for Democracy Fund It's going be a venture investment fund that will invest in innovative businesses run by exiled Russians and Belarusians as well as entrepreneurs from post-Soviet countries who are clean and unrelated to Putin We want to help them build their own businesses abroad, but also transfer 50 percent of the carried interest to support Russian civil society actors I know these mechanisms do not exist in the world, so we have the first  I'm very glad that I managed to convince experienced investors of Russian origin to support this effort, both intellectually by picking investments and financially So that's what we can do apart from this great goal of survival Zhanna Nemtsova is cofounder of the Boris Nemtsov Foundation for Freedom and codirector of the Boris Nemtsov Academic Centre for the Study of Russia at Charles University Department of Philosophy All views expressed are the author's own  As told to Shane Croucher Do you have a unique experience or personal story to share?
