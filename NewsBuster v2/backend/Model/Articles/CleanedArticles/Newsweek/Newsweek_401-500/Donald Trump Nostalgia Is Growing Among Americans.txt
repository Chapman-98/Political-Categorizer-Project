As the prospect of a Joe Biden-Donald Trump rematch in this year's presidential election rises, a poll indicates that more Americans are looking back at Trump's term in office with nostalgia Forty percent said Trump's presidency was better than expected, according to the NBC News poll  About one-third of those surveyed (31 percent) said Trump's time in office was about as expected, while 29 percent said it was worse than expected The poll found that voters were more critical of Biden's presidency  Only 14 percent said Biden has done better than expected, while 42 percent said he has done worse than expected  Some 44 percent said he has done about as well as they expected The poll of 1,000 registered voters was conducted between January 26 and 30 Trump has won Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada as he marches toward the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, with Republicans increasingly converging behind him, even as he faces an array of legal problems—including 91 charges in four separate criminal cases  He is looking to secure a huge delegate haul during the Super Tuesday contests on March 5, which would move him closer to become the party's nominee Overall, the assessment of Trump's performance as president was better than when NBC News asked the same question in August 2018  Then, only 29 percent said the Trump administration was doing better than they expected, 43 percent said it was going about as well as they expected, while 27 percent said it was worse than they expected The new poll suggested that Republicans tend to look back at the Trump presidency more fondly, with 80 percent of Republican voters saying it was better than expected and only 6 percent saying it was worse  About 24 percent said it was about as expected Democrats, on the other hand, were more critical of Biden's presidency  About half—52 percent—of Democrats say his administration is about as expected, 30 percent said it was better than expected and 18 percent said it was worse Many respondents cited the economy and border security when asked about their feelings about Biden and Trump  Both are top issues ahead of the 2024 election "Certainly some of the nostalgia comes from Americans remembering a time when they could go to the grocery store and not feel like they had to take out a second mortgage to pay for a carton of milk," Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and director of the Centre on U S  Politics at University College London in the U K , told Newsweek "But more generally, there's a tendency for citizens to view the past with more fondness and for the esteem of presidents to increase when they're not in the political arena "Gift said that public opinion on former President George W  Bush has "done a total 180" since he was in the White House "Today, his approval numbers are almost twice what they were when he served as commander-in-chief," he said Those who thought Trump's term in office was worse then expected cited his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him and the January 6, 2021, riot at the U S  Capitol Those critical of Biden's presidency cited his age, mental fitness and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war Link to Image
