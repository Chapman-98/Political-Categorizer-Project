Former President Donald Trump's lawyer Alina Habba has seemingly endorsed a meme arguing that the country "needs" women like her more than pop star Taylor Swift.Swift, who endorsed President Joe Biden in the 2020 election and has spoken out against Trump, has recently been the focus of an intensified media spotlight while supporting her boyfriend Travis Kelce's journey to another Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chiefs.While speculation that Swift may endorse Biden again in this year's election mounts, the added attention that the singer has received by the media during NFL games has infuriated some devotees of Trump's MAGA movement in recent months.Habba, whose courtroom antics were mocked by many during two unsuccessful defenses of defamation lawsuits against Trump from retired Elle columnist E. Jean Carroll, shared a meme comparing herself to Swift on her Instagram account Monday.The meme shows side-by-side images of the two women, alongside the caption: "Who thinks this country needs a lot more women like Alina Habba, and a lot less like Taylor Swift? [person raising hand emoji]"Newsweek reached out for comment to Swift's representative via email on Monday.Trump-supporting former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy suggested Monday in a post to X, formerly Twitter, that the outcome of the Super Bowl is pre-determined and that Swift and Kelce are "an artificially culturally propped-up couple" who would soon endorse Biden.Republican political commentator Meghan McCain, daughter of the late Senator John McCain, responded to Ramaswamy's theory by calling out "nutjob 'republicans'" who "are floating ugly and insane conspiracy theories" about Swift as "total idiots" in her own X post.Fox News host Jesse Watters aired a different conspiracy theory about Swift on his show this month, claiming without evidence that the Department of Defense may have recruited Swift as an "asset" to be used in "a psyop."A poll conducted exclusively for Newsweek by Redfield & Wilton Strategies revealed this month that 18 percent of voters are "more likely" or "significantly more likely" to vote for a candidate endorsed by Swift.Younger voters were the most likely to be swayed by Swift, with the poll finding that about three in 10 Americans under age 35 said that they would be more likely to vote for a candidate backed by Swift."[Swift has] influenced popular culture, sports, the economics of entire regions of the U.S.," communications consultant James Haggerty told Newsweek. "So why not politics and elections?"However, 17 percent of respondents said they would be less likely to vote for a Swift-backed candidate, while 55 percent said they would be unaffected by her opinion. Only 45 percent of those polled said that they were fans of Swift.Link to Image
