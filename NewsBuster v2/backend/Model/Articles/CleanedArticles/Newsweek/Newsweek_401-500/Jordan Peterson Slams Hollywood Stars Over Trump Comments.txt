Jordan Petersonhas lashed out at celebrities who share their political beliefs during awards show.The Canadian psychologist appeared on Piers Morgan's eponymous show on Talk TV, where they discussed the recent Golden Globes ceremony.Morgan said the Hollywood stars must have got the "Ricky Gervais memo," after the comedian hosted in 2020 and in his opening monologue chastised celebrities for their constant "virtue signalling" during their winning speeches."I watched the whole thing for three hours, no political speeches, no virtue signalling and no grandstanding. People did what Ricky Gervais told them to do three years ago; get up, thank your agent, sit down, and just celebrate making movies or TV shows," Morgan stated.Peterson replied saying art should not serve politics because it gets "dull.""At the Golden Globes the storytellers are realising that subordinating their venture to the idiot political, especially a victim-victimiser narrative, which is the lowest form of the political, is counterproductive in every possible way, including financially," Peterson told Morgan."The art should never be subordinated to serve the political because then it gets not only does it get propagandistic, it gets dull and contemptible."No one cares what a star thinks about Trump, especially when, what they have to say about Trump can be said just as coherently by your demented neighbour."Hollywood stars believe that their luxurious and privileged life isn't paid for by the gruelling necessity of having to make a movie, which is more something like a great adventure, so they feel guilty and feel that they have to serve something real."The influencer, who is known for being outspoken about his controversial takes on everything from transgender rights to feminism and white privilege, is no stranger to having beefs with Hollywood stars.Peterson was suspended from X, formerly known as Twitter, over a 2022 post about transgender actor Elliot Page where he deadnamed The Umbrella Academy star.Despite the ban, Peterson said he would "rather die" than remove the post, sharing a 15-minute Instagram video.Later that year, Peterson responded to actress and director Olivia Wilde, who called him a "pseudo-intellectual hero to the incel community" in a discussion with Interview magazine. She was referencing the sub-culture of "involuntarily celibate" men, who are hostile towards women due to their romantic failures, based on the definition of the anti-hate organization Anti-Defamation League.Peterson defended himself against the comments in another interview on Morgan's show."I thought the marginalized were supposed to have a voice?" he said, becoming teary-eyed, before defending "incels.""Demand high standards from your man. Fair enough," he said. "But all these men who are alienated, they're lonesome and they don't know what to do, and everyone piles abuse on them."Christopher Nolan's film Oppenheimer and HBO's Succession were the big winners at the 2024 Golden Globes.
