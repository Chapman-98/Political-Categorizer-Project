A Christian college professor who called conservative commentator and ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson "fascist" in a social media post has lost his job The news came after old social media posts written by Warner were shared by a Grace alumni and former employee, Evan Kilgore, on Facebook in October 2023  In them, Warner appeared to criticize the GOP and conservative ideologies Warner wrote in December 2022, "Tucker Carlson is fascist," among other statements on X, formerly Twitter  In one post from September 2022, Warner wrote, "I support gay marriage," and in another from February 2022 he said, "My pronouns are he/they " The posts spanned over years, but some were written after he started his position at Grace College in September 2023 Newsweek reached out to Carlson's team via email for comment In an emailed statement to Newsweek, Grace College, in Indiana, wrote on behalf of its Chief Human Resource Officer Norman Bakhit: "Dr  Matt Warner fulfilled his agreement for the year  Grace College wishes Dr  Warner well in his future endeavors  As with all personnel matters, we are unable to provide further comment "Kilgore said in his post that his goal was not to get Warner fired  In an article earlier this month, he told Religion News Service (RNS) that he shared Warner's posts because "parents might want to be aware of somebody who has influence over their child with these beliefs "Grace College parent Monica Boyer, however, did want Warner fired  In a Facebook post from October 2023, Boyer criticized Warner for supporting gay marriage and called for Warner's termination "immediately ""They've created a caricature of me based on taking a very small number of social media posts out of context," Warner told RNS  "I was treated from the beginning as a threat or liability  And nobody at any time had a conversation with me about what I believe, or what I'm willing to do to support the college "When asked by Newsweek if he regrets any of his posts, Warner said via email: "The original smear campaign, which included screenshots of my tweets—virtually all of which were from before I was employed at Grace College—included about 100 tweets  Generally, I stand by them "My only regret is that a few of them violated my own commitment to love others well, and went into the arena of name-calling (e g  'opposing it is bigotry')  I think the group of tweets that they selected—in their attempt to stir up controversy—demonstrate that their concern with me was never about my faith, or my theology  They are political operatives who oppose my personal politics "Finally, unfortunately, in some tweets I used technical language which I meant denotatively (e g  fascism) which were understood as slurs; and some others were ironic and were taken as literal  But I don't regret using technical language or irony  I regret that the senior administration at Grace College did not have the courage to stand up to outside influences, and defend their faculty "When Newsweek contacted Grace College about Warner's remarks, they said, "As we mentioned in our statement, we are unable to provide further comment on personal matters "Warner Refused to ResignWarner learned after meeting with his supervisors amid Boyer's demands for his termination, that he wasn't an official faculty member because the college's board of trustees had not ratified him, RNS reported  In December 2023, Warner found out that the board voted not to ratify him, meaning he would leave at the end of the academic year Before the board's vote in mid-October, Grace College President Drew Flamm offered Warner the option to voluntarily resign, or Warner could opt for a "potential pathway forward" that included meeting regularly with Flamm and other administrators, RNS reported  However, Warner said that the second option never materialized After the board vote, he was again offered to voluntarily resign  Bakhit offered Warner $60,000 for his resignation and a confidentiality agreement, according to RNS In a Facebook post from Tuesday, Warner said he turned down the resignation deal "because I could not pretend that the school was living out its Christian values as an institution  Christian leadership should be known for grace, love and our ability to and commitment to stand on—and be transparent concerning—our values "Warner added: "Grace College had no problem with my understanding of politics and faith being two separate things  The only concern they shared with me concerning my social media was tone and tenor, not content or ideas, nor theology or politics "Ethan Campbell, an English professor, reacted to the news of Warner's termination, writing on May 9: "Many aspects of your story are enraging, but I think the worst is the college's policy of hiring faculty on a provisional basis before the board gives final approval, and not informing them  That is deeply unethical, possibly illegal  You were on probation without knowing it ""It's nice to see some colleges with a backbone standing up to the cultural revolution," C Jay Engel, host of the paleoconservative Chronicles Magazine podcast, said of Warner Link to Image
