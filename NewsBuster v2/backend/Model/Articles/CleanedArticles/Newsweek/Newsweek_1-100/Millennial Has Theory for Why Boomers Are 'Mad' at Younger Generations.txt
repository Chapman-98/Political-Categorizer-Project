One millennial has shared her theory about why some baby boomers appear to dislike their younger counterparts In a video posted on TikTok, Thai Branch (@ella_thaii) explained that she thinks baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) are "so mad" at millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) and Generation Z (born between 1997 and 2012) because they had to "endure things" that younger people simply refuse to put up with In contrast to previous generations, Branch, 30, from New York City, told Newsweek that millennials and Gen Zers don't lack endurance; rather, they're "choosing not to step into lives" they don't want Whether it's a job, a relationship, or starting a family, nowadays, people want flexibility rather than following the same pattern as their elders  While previously there were social stigmas surrounding divorce or women choosing careers over children, Branch says that millennials "don't really care about that" and forge their own paths instead "I think the younger generations are showing that there's a different way to live and that it's never too late to pivot or that it's not too late to change something when it no longer serves you  When we talk about the four-day week, for example, we realize we don't have to work five days to get tasks done," she said "Life is all about balance, and we're trying to show them that it's possible  But the way they perceive it is that we're lazy  It's not that we don't want to work, it's that we realize things can be done more efficiently "How Do the Generations Differ?Many factors can influence generations, including historical events, wars, politics, the economy, and technology  Pew Research Center notes that many millennials entered the workforce at the height of a recession, which greatly impacted their earnings and life choices thereafter  That's thought to have caused a "slow start" for millennials, the effects of which will be felt for some time Technology has also had a radical effect on society  While boomers grew up when television was starting to expand, Gen X and millennials felt the impact of the internet explosion  Likewise, Gen Z has grown up surrounded by technology and constant connectivity through social media Each generation certainly differs from the next, but the Pew Research Center also suggests that there can be stark contrasts within generations  A millennial born in 1996 might feel a strong connection with older Gen Zers or vice versa  That is to say, generations are more than just a title, and there are many complexities within each one Millennials and Gen Zers are graced with many choices and freedoms that weren't previously an option for boomers  And while that's a positive shift, Branch believes their resentment derives from naivety due to the "disconnect" between generations That isn't to say that younger generations have it easy now either, which is why Branch wants boomers to be more accepting of the difficulties that younger people face in this climate  From house prices to the job market, it's no easy ride "We all have our struggles, but if we take a step back, we can learn from one another  We are not enemies, and if we see each other that way, we miss out on the opportunity to learn from one another  We're all just people trying to figure it out trying to navigate this crazy thing called life," she said How Did Social Media React?Since sharing her thoughts on TikTok, Branch has been amazed by the response she's received  At the time of writing, the video has already gained over 899,600 views and more than 133,100 likes "I think this sparked an amazing conversation  It hasn't been a battle between boomers and Gen Z, and a lot of the comments I've seen are from Gen X saying they love that millennials are speaking about this," Branch said "I got a lot of boomers speaking about the things they experienced that they wish they didn't have to  The comment section has been a safe space because I'm not pointing the finger and saying they're wrong, I'm empathizing with them while simultaneously presenting our point "It's all too easy to see the differences between the generations and compare, but Branch insists that "we're not so different" after all, and should embrace the changes At the time of writing, the clip had already received more than 6,100 comments on TikTok, with one person responding: "Exactly  I am not going to be miserable and pretend like my parents did "Another TikTok user wrote: "Boomers and most Gen X have a lot of resentment and misplaced anger with millennials "While another comment reads: "The childfree movement really annoys older generations  Childfree for the win "Do you have viral videos or pictures that you want to share?
