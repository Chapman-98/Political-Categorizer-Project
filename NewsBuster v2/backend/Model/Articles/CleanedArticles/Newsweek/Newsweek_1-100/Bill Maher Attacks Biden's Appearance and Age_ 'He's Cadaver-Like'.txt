Comedian and television personality Bill Maher took a few shots at President Joe Biden's age and appearance on Tuesday's episode of "The View" The "Real Time" host said even though former president Donald Trump is only a few years younger than Biden, the 81-year-old president appears much older "He's cadaver-like," Maher said Maher then argued that Biden should not be running for re-election in 2024 "He's going to be Ruth Bader Biden," Maher said, comparing the president to late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who held onto her position until she died "She didn't take the hint and she was not in good health and she stayed too long," Maher said  "And she ruined her legacy and got the Supreme Court now to be a right-wing organization  I said Biden shouldn't do that "Maher explained he's not afraid to speak out against Biden, despite the political consequences "My bond with my audience is you're not going to like everything I say, but you know I'm saying what I really think is true," Maher said Some of the policies and beliefs that are emerging in today's society may empower Trump voters, Maher warned "What's going to get him elected is this woke stuff that a lot of people in this country just don't go for," Maher said He said while the left has changed, far-right views are "the bigger threat "Trump's personality could also distract voters from his dangerous policies, Maher explained "Donald Trump benefits from people not taking him seriously because he's both stupid and crazy," Maher said Maher also expressed anger that Trump has not been punished legally for various crimes he has been accused of "They've had four years to do this," Maher said  "Where was it? Why are we coming to the end and they're able to run out the clock? It's ridiculous  The Democrats do this every time "Maher appeared on the show to promote his new book "What This Comedian Said Will Shock You," which comments on life, politics and culture He also talked about the Israel-Hamas war  He said Israel is trying to defend themselves from the terrorist organization Hamas' threats and attacks He also called out people who are supporting Hamas over Israel "If you're for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day, and I'm not talking while the war is on, I mean before the war  Trust me, you would go running and screaming and begging to live in Tel Aviv, a place that has your values," Maher said Link to Image
