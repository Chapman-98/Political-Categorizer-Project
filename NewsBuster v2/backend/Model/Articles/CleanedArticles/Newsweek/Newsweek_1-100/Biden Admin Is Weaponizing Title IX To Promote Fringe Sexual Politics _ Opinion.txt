Earlier this month, the Office for Civil Rights in the Biden Education Department issued a new regulation on how schools must observe Title IX, the 1972 ban on sex discrimination in federally funded education  The rule transforms Title IX from a relatively benign equal-opportunity law into a weapon for sex-based identity politics  It removes due process protection for students accused of sexual misconduct and favors gender ideology over free speech and, ironically, over women's sports programs that owe their existence to Title IX itself  Congress should use its powers under the Congressional Review Act to reject this rule as agency overreach and state attorneys general should sue the Education Department to stop it from taking effect in August Title IX did not need a new rule  It just got one in 2020, thanks to the heroic efforts of President Donald Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos  She inherited a Title IX mess created by a 2011 Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) which was, supposedly, meant to help schools fight sex discrimination  In fact, however, the DCL browbeat schools into "finding" discrimination and harassment by expanding their definitions and by lowering the burden of proof to find guilt  For example, the DCL said that discriminatory sexual harassment included not just quid pro quo propositions (where a teacher or professor demands sex in exchange for good grades) but also the creation of a "hostile environment," a far more subjective standard The evolving definition of sex discrimination was a product of feminist advocacy  But that evolution always threatened—and continues to threaten—fundamental rights such as free speech and due process  By the subjective standards imposed under the DCL, "You look pretty today!" could qualify as Title IX sexual harassment if the statement is deemed hostile and affects someone's studies  So what happens, then, to free speech? And if students engage in sexual "hook ups" but later one student feels consent was lacking, are colleges equipped to investigate and adjudicate claims of criminal acts like assault and rape? What about protecting due process—such as the presumption of innocence and the right to see evidence—for those accused?In point of fact, the 2011 DCL resulted in hundreds of students and professors being wrongly accused, and even suspended, expelled, or fired with little to no chance at self-defense  Many of them successfully sued their schools for due process violations  DeVos stopped this chaos by rescinding the 2011 DCL in 2017  She then spent three years developing and promulgating a new Title IX rule that protects both complainants and due process  That rule was upheld as fair and lawful by every court to review it Tragically, Biden's regulation will undo these gains  It allows schools to investigate sexual harassment claims with an "individual meeting method" similar to the "single investigator model" used under the DCL, which resulted in all the due process disasters and lawsuits  In effect, Biden is eliminating formality, including live hearings at colleges, while increasing the discretion and power of Title IX staff  But these staffers have no legal or courtroom experience with due process  Instead, they come from heavily politicized disciplines such as Women's Studies or Gender Studies Given these realities, any sound Title IX rule should do the opposite of what the Biden rule does—that is, Title IX staff should have less discretion and more formality for investigations and adjudications including real-time, live hearings with a written record  This ensures transparency and facilitates appellate review—both of which act as checks on the power of campus bureaucrats  But Biden is giving a blank check to the very people who need more oversight The new Title IX rule also redefines the word "sex" to include "gender identity" and "sexual orientation" such that dissenting views on gender or refusal to use preferred pronouns will be treated—and prosecuted—as a federal offense  In fact, Biden's education officials have already investigated California's Taft College for just such a refusal as if it were already illegal It's not  In fact, interpreting and enforcing Title IX this way violates the United States Constitution  Americans have a First Amendment right not only to free speech but also to the free exercise of religion, which often informs their views on gender  In the public education setting, students and faculty can speak—or not speak—according to their conscience  Title IX cannot change that, no matter what Biden administration officials say Most controversial, the redefinition of sex to include "gender identity" means that males claiming to be female and wanting to use women's locker rooms, or play on women's sports teams, can now claim that Title IX gives them that right  Ironically, women's athletics only exist in their present form, especially at the college level, because Title IX was interpreted decades ago to mandate not just equal athletic opportunity but equal funding for female sports programs  All this must now yield, however, to the yet more transgressive phenomenon of sex identity politics  Girls uncomfortable with guys watching them undress? Parents angry? Biden says: Get over it!The Biden rule represents the administrative state run amok: Activist agencies get an inch, then take a mile to make novel policy  But policymaking is the job of Congress, not the executive branch  Fortunately, Congress has the power, under the Congressional Review Act, to overrule regulations that, like this one, infringe on the legislature's policy making function  It's time for Congress to use this power What's more, Tennessee has led 20 states in suing the Biden administration for Title IX overreach  The state attorneys general who filed the complaint should cite the new rule as perhaps the most egregious example of ultra vires action Finally, while lawless ideologues in power in Washington, D C , zealously pursue their radicalism, real problems in American education go overlooked Since COVID, for example, American academic achievement has plummeted  And this trend has not affected boys and girls equally  One study has shown that learning loss has affected female students more on the primary and secondary level, but male students may have been hindered in their studies more at the post-secondary level These findings should interest the Office for Civil Rights at the Education Department  If officials there were resourceful and properly focused, federal grants and other initiatives could help remedy the situation and perhaps improve student prospects and thereby change the future for many young Americans But Biden Education Department officials can't be bothered with that  They're too busy weaponizing Title IX to trash due process and to promote fringe sexual politics Teresa R  Manning is Policy Director at the National Association of Scholars, President of Virginia Association of Scholars and a former law professor at Virginia's Scalia Law School, George Mason University  She authored the 2020 Report "Dear Colleague: The Weaponization of Title IX "The views expressed in this article are the writer's own Link to Image
