"The View" hosts mocked the viral exchange between Georgia RepublicanÂ Marjorie Taylor Greene and Texas Democrat Jasmine Crockett during a house committee meeting on Friday's episode of the ABC talk show."What is this, junior high or Congress?" host Joy Behar jokingly asked.Host Sunny Hostin said the argument represents a larger issue in government."It shows just the utter disfunction of this Congress and the waste of our taxpayer dollars," Hostin said. "I've just never seen anything like it."Hostin claimed that Greene is "unfit for office.""She lacks the decorum," Hostin said.The argument that's gone viral unfolded during a House Oversight Committee meeting on Thursday. The lawmakers were deciding whether they should move forward with a contempt resolution against Attorney General Merrick Garland when Greene commented on Crockett's appearance.Greene brought up something unrelated to the subject of the hearing, so Crockett asked Greene, "Do you know what we're here for?""I don't think you know what you're here for," Greene responded. "I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading."New York Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez then got involved."That is absolutely unacceptable, how dare you attack the physical appearance of another person," Ocasio-Cortez said.Crockett asked the panel's chairman, Kentucky Republican Representative James Comer, why Greene's words were not seen as a personal attack."I'm just curious. To better understand your ruling, if someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody's bleached blonde, bad-built, butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct?" Crockett asked.Host Ana Navarro called the exchange a "spectacle.""I'd like to tell Marjorie Taylor Greene that this table knows from experience fake eyelashes do nothing to impede your ability to talk and think," Navarro said.Host Alyssa Farah Griffin said the hearing had more drama than a reunion of the reality series "Vanderpump Rules." She also urged lawmakers to focus more on the issues the US government is facing."What frustrates me about this moment in our politics is the unseriousness when there's very serious things happening," Griffin said.Host Sara Haines agreed that the argument seemed like it was "made for reality TV."Haines also faulted Comer for not enforcing a rule that forbids personal attacks, which is what led to Crockett's "bleached blonde, bad-built, butch body" insult."You are setting the tone for that and you are allowing for that," Haines said.Link to Image
