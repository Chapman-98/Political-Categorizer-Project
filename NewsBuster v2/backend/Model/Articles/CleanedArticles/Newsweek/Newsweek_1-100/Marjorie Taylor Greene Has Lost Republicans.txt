Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has been condemned by Republican colleagues over her failed attempt to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson, with Donald Trump also weighing in to criticize her effort Greene followed through on her threat to introduce a motion to vacate against the House Speaker on Wednesday after Johnson pushed through a number of foreign aid bills, including providing $61 billion to Ukraine amid Russia's invasion of the country The House overwhelmingly voted to table, or kill, the motion by a margin of 359 to 43, with 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats supporting killing the proposal  The 43 House members who voted against blocking Greene's measure to remove Johnson consisted of 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats Both the GOP and the Democrats said they did not want a repeat of the weeks of chaos that engulfed the lower chamber when Kevin McCarthy was ousted as House Speaker last October  With the GOP having just a one-seat majority in the House, Greene's motion was destined to fail as the Democrats vowed to side with the Republicans in voting to keep Johnson in his role The MAGA congresswoman has been attacked by her GOP colleagues for pushing through with the vote regardless  Greene was reportedly booed by fellow Republicans after introducing her motion to vacate plans on the chamber floor Greene's office has been contacted for comment via email "All of us in life get to decide how we handle disappointment: you can be productive or you can be destructive," South Dakota Congressman Dusty Johnson said at the Capitol ahead of the resolution vote  "Ms  Marjorie Taylor Greene is choosing destructive "Most of us by the time we turn 12 years old figured out the tantrums don't actually work, but apparently not everybody in Congress got the memo "New York GOP Rep  Mike Lawleradded: "Moscow Marjorie has clearly gone off the deep end, maybe theresult of a space laser "But this type of tantrum is absolutely unacceptable, and it does nothing to further the cause of the conservative movement "The only people who have stymied our ability to govern are the very people that have pulled these types of stunts throughout the course of this Congress to undermine the House Republican majority," Lawler said Florida Rep  Matt Gaetz, who spearheaded the move to vacate McCarthy, said he voted to table Greene's motion as it would damage the GOP in this election year "I voted to table the motion for one principal reason - with a two seat majority in an election year I believe 2-3 Republicans could be susceptible to bribes to resign or even vote for a Democrat," Gaetz posted on X, formerly Twitter  "Democrats would then instantly deem Trump an 'insurrectionist' to bar him from the ballot  House Republicans must do better  We must be led better  We must return Trump to the White House "Elsewhere, Trump said that while he does "love" Greene, she should not be pushing to remove the Republican House Speaker "With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate," Trump wrote on Truth Social "At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time  We are leading in the Presidential Polls by a lot, both Nationally and in the Swing States  Likewise, we are doing well in the Senate, and I believe will do well in the House  But if we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!"After the House voted to keep him in his job, Johnson said: "Hopefully this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress "Greene herself said she was not surprised that the House voted to quash her attempt against Johnson "I think this is exactly what the American people needed to see," she said "I didn't run for Congress to come up here and join the Uniparty, and the Uniparty was on full display today  As a matter of fact, [the Republican Party] proved they're ready to do everything with the Democrats "In a statement explaining why a majority of Democrats voted to keep Johnson in his role, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said: "Our decision to stop Rep  Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solving problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner "We need more common sense and less chaos in Washington, D C  Marjorie Taylor Greene and the extreme MAGA Republicans are chaos agents  House Democrats are change agents  We will continue to govern in a reasonable, responsible and results-oriented manner and to put people over politics all day and every day "Link to Image
