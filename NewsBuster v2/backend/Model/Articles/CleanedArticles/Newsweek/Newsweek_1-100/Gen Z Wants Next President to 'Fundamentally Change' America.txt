Gen Z is not looking for the next president to keep the status quo  Unlike some of their elders, Gen Z said they want the next president to "fundamentally change" America, according to a recent New York Times poll The survey, which spanned more than 4,000 U S  registered voters, discovered a stark difference between how Gen Z and older generations are looking at the next president and their impact on politics Among the younger generation, 68 percent said they want a candidate who promises to fundamentally change America  That was significantly higher than those who said the same among Millennials, Gen X and Baby Boomers Those aged 30 to 44 only said they wanted this type of candidate 52 percent of the time, and that number fell to 35 percent among the 45 to 64 generation  And among those aged 65 and higher, just 18 percent said they wanted the president to fundamentally change America Those older were much more inclined to favor the status quo when it came to next presidential candidate  Those 65 and older said they wanted a candidate who promises to bring politics in Washington "back to normal" 71 percent of the time, with 55 percent of those aged 45 to 64 agreeing as well Among younger Americans, the mostly Gen Z group (aged 18-29) said this just 27 percent of the time Disrupting the Status QuoThe generational gap can largely be attributed to the differences Gen Zers have toward widespread change in general  They've been described as more likely to disrupt the status quo, both in the workplace and socially, and their hopes for a politician match that "We are seeing more and more young people gravitate toward leadership that empowers, speaks and acts with compassion, and promotes action on equity, diversity, inclusion, and on climate change," Markus Moos, a professor at the School of Planning at the University of Waterloo in Canada, told Newsweek "Young people long have desired their leaders to share their own values, but this has become intensified today "And when it comes to the "fundamental change" that Gen Z seeks, they are more likely to have very specific ideas about what that entails already, and they want a presidential leader to reflect that, Moos said "Young people are not looking for leaders that tell them what's good for them," Moos said  "Young people know what's needed, and they need leadership and older generations with experience to help them implement positive change "Gen Z specifically is likely looking for a leader who will disrupt the country when it comes to issues of inequality and climate change, which they feel require "systemic and fundamental" changes, Moos said "They want their leaders to act on these issues in ways that can make lasting impact not with ongoing band aid solutions," Moos said  "Gen Z is growing up in a time of unprecedented global disruption and their views for the need for change likely reflect that "Younger Americans might also vote for the next president with a specific eye toward the Israel-Hamas conflict  Compared to their elders, they lean more in support of Palestine, with 44 percent in the survey saying they sympathize more with Palestine compared to just 15 percent of those aged 65 and over The Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people in the process  After that, Israel launched a widespread military operation in Gaza that has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to The Associated Press and Gaza health officials President Joe Biden's policy so far has largely supported Israel  The president previously called on Hamas to release all remaining hostages from the attack  He also pushed for a two-state solution that would allow Palestinians to live alongside Israelis "Israel has a right to go after Hamas," Biden said in his State of the Union speech in March, while adding Israel had a "fundamental responsibility" to protect everyday civilians as it goes after the Palestinian militant group Historically, younger voters are less likely to show up to the polls, but recent years saw a higher turnout among those in their late teens and 20s  And while Gen Z tends to favor Biden over Donald Trump, many are becoming less enthused with the president, especially when it comes to his Middle East policies  That could make many Gen Z voters sit out the election altogether A recent Harvard poll found less than half of those aged 18 to 29 said they'd "definitely vote" this year, whereas 57 percent said the same in 2020 Still, the most recent Havard Youth poll found Biden was leading with 45 percent support, while Trump had 37 percent  For the Gen Z "likely" voters, the incumbent's support climbs to 56 percent with the Republican's staying roughly the same Link to Image
