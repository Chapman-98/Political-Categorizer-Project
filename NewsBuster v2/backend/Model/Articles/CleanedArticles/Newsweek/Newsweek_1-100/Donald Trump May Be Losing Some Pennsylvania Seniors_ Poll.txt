Former President Donald Trump could be losing his hold among senior voters in the key swing state of Pennsylvania In 2020, CNN exit polls revealed Trump was a favorite among voters in the Keystone State aged 65 and up, gaining 53 percent of the senior vote in the presidential election Newer polls reveal seniors aren't yet as supportive of the GOP frontrunner this election cycle A New York Times poll found that Trump holds 44 percent support among seniors in Pennsylvania if the election were held today  Roughly 41 percent of the same age group said they would back Biden in the same scenario An AARP voter survey showed Trump with 52 percent support among voters over the age of 50 compared to Biden's 42 percent  That number narrowed to a 48-46 lead for Trump in voters aged 65 and up, showing more tightening in the age group for the key state Pennsylvania is a key swing state not only for the White House race, but for control of the Senate as well  Support for Trump or Biden at the top of the ticket could play a key role in who wins the Senate election between Democratic incumbent Sen  Bob Casey and Republican challenger David McCormick According to experts, voters over the age of 50 are a key demographic in the state and could swing elections one way or the other "With inflation and the rising costs of living squeezing all Pennsylvania households, Black voters 50+ are clearly looking for leaders with a plan  Candidates would be wise to listen to their opinions and concerns if they want to win in November," Bill Johnston-Walsh, AARP Pennsylvania State Director said, according to MyChesCo Among that specific group in the AARP poll, Biden is still by far the top contender, having around 84 percent of the support compared to Trump's 8 percent Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016, the first time the state went for the GOP White House candidate since 1988, but Biden took it back in 2020 by just over 1 percentage point Across all Pennsylvania seniors in the AARP poll, nearly four in five say a candidate's position on Social Security will be integral in deciding who they vote for on election day, with 67 percent saying prescription drug costs will also play a key role Those numbers rise to 84 percent and 70 percent among senior voters "Continued failure to focus on addressing issues and related relevant policies to specifically benefit's seniors, would be very detrimental to any potential chances for success by either candidate for the presidency in the upcoming national presidential election," William F  Hall, an adjunct professor of political science at Webster University, in St  Louis told Newsweek Earlier this year, the Treasury announced Social Security was set to become insolvent by 2033 when full payments would no longer be available  Medicare has a similar end date if nothing else changes, running out of funds for full payments in 2036 Seniors often show up in large numbers at the polls, and this year will likely be no different  The AARP report found 86 percent of its 65 and up respondents were "extremely motivated" to vote A different survey from Quinnipiac University a few months ago found among 1,600 surveyed Pennsylvania voters, 60 percent of those aged 65 and over would be voting for Biden, while a 37 percent said the same of Trump "There seems to be a trend with Biden's poll rating creeping up among older voters, and this could be significant," Mark Shanahan, an associate professor in politics at the University of Surrey, previously told Newsweek  "The majority of older voters are white and conservative and have tended to favor Republican candidates since George W  Bush  But the Biden administration has targeted areas that matter to seniors, especially around health, in a way they're simply not seeing from Trump "Newsweek reached out to both the Biden and Trump campaigns for comment Link to Image
