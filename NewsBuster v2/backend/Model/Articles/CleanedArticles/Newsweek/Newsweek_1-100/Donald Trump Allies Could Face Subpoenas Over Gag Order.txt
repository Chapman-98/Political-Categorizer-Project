Donald Trump's political supporters allegedly helped him violate his court-ordered gag order, according to a former federal prosecutor Eric Lisann said that senior Republican politicians could be subpoenaed for acting as Trump's mouthpieces during his hush-money trial in New York  He added that both Judge Juan Merchan and prosecutors will want to know if the GOP politicians' comments about the trial were orchestrated by Trump  Merchan had placed a gag order on the former White House leader that prevents him from criticizing jurors or potential witnesses in the case The presumptive Republican presidential nominee for 2024 is the first former president in U S  history to stand trial in a criminal case  He has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records  Trump has continually said that this case and other criminal and civil challenges involving him are politically motivated The prosecution seeks to prove that, before the 2016 presidential election, Trump paid or discussed paying former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep secret his alleged affairs with them  He denies affairs with both women "Trump is not denying that he is directing others to speak in ways that are violations of the gag order - which is a violation of the gag order," Lisann wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday On Tuesday, Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama urged fellow Republicans to help Trump "overcome" the gag order Tuberville and fellow Republican senators, J D  Vance and Rick Scott, attended the Trump trial on Monday and strongly criticized the trial to the media gathered outside "The judge, Justice Merchan, can order Trump to show cause why he should not be held in contempt  The DA can request that also  Subpoenas could go out to Scott, Vance, and Tuberville  But they think it would be a distracting circus and it could well be  That doesn't mean though it is less problematic than doing nothing," Lisann wrote Newsweek sought email comment from Trump's attorney and from Tuberville, Vance and Scott's offices on Wednesday During an interview with Newsmax TV on Tuesday, Tuberville said that circumventing Trump's gag order was one of the reasons he and his colleagues made an appearance at the trial on Monday "Hopefully we'll have more and more senators and congressmen go up every day and represent him," Tuberville said  "And be able to go out and overcome this gag order  That's one of the reasons we went, to be able to speak our piece for President Trump "Florida Congressmen Byron Donalds and Cory Mills; former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy; and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum showed up at the trial on Tuesday to show support for Trump Merchan has fined the former president for numerous violations of the gag order and warned him that the next time he may be facing jail time Mark Shanahan, associate professor in politics at the U K 's University of Surrey, told Newsweek reporter Darragh Roche that Trump surrogates "can make the kinds of attack on all aspects of the trial that the defendant can't," unless they are "seen to be directed by Trump in the comments they make ""In bringing MAGA-loyal members of Congress to the New York courtroom, the Trump team have found an effective, if possibly short-term, means to subvert the gag order on the ex-president," Shanahan said Link to Image
