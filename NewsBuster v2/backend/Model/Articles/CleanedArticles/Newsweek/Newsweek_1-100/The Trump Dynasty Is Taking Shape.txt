Donald Trump is attempting to create a political dynasty out of his family, one of whom could be the next Republican presidential nominee if he secures a second White House term in November, according to a leading political scientist."If there's one thing Trump loves better than himself, it's the idea of a Trump dynasty," Thomas Gift, head of the Centre on US Politics at University College London, told Newsweek.Trump became the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential candidate in March following a string of primary victories. If he defeats incumbent Joe Biden in the upcoming presidential election, he will only be constitutionally eligible to serve one more term, all but inevitability triggering speculation as to who will become the next standard bearer of his Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement.As a sign of the Trump family's influence, all of the former president's children, except Ivanka Trump, a former White House advisor, were initially selected among the 41 at-large delegates who will represent Florida at the Republican National Convention in July. His 18-year-old son, Barron Trump, laterturned down the offer.The office of former first lady Melania Trump, his mother, released a statement saying, "While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines to participate due to prior commitments."However, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Tiffany Boulos (n√©e Trump) are all due to serve as Florida delegates, as are Michael Boulos and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the partners of Tiffany and Donald Jr., respectively.In March, Lara Trump, Eric's wife, was elected as co-chair of the Republican National Committee after receiving an endorsement from her father-in-law."Who says Trump is a self-absorbed megalomaniac? If there's one thing Trump loves better than himself, it's the idea of a Trump dynasty," Gift said."The opportunity to cast a long shadow over the arc of American politics for eight years, and then some, is surely too much for Trump to pass up. If Trump wins in 2024, teeing up his successor, preferably with his same last name, is almost certain to be a running storyline."Newsweek reached out to representatives of Donald Trump's 2024 campaign via email at 6:15 a.m. ET on Wednesday. This article will be updated if they decide to comment.Donald Jr., in particular, has attracted a strong following from within the MAGA movement and currently hosts a podcast called Triggered With Don Jr.In February, he was widely criticized after making an Instagram post comparing former first lady Michelle Obama to an NFL player.Donald Jr. shared a photograph of former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Levon Kirkland and the words, "found this rare Michelle Obama rookie card."In response, one Instagram user claimed the post was an example of "racism," while another branded it "disgusting, mean behavior."Link to Image
