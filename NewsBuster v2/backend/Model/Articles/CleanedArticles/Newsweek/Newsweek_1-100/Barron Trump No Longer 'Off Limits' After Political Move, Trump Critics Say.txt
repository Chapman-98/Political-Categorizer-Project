A number of Donald Trump critics are suggesting that the former president's youngest son, Barron, is now open for scrutiny after wading into the world of politics.Social media users have said that Barron Trump, who turned 18 in March, is now "fair game" and no longer "off limits" to attacks from the media and elsewhere after he was announced as a Florida delegate to the Republican National Convention.Republican Party of Florida chairman Evan Power said Barron, who graduates high school in May, will be one of 41 at-large delegates from Florida at the Republican National Convention in July, where his father will be confirmed as the GOP's 2024 presidential candidate, NBC News first reported.The move will be the first time the 18-year-old has been placed in the political spotlight in such a public way, joining his siblings Eric, Donald Trump Jr. and Tiffany as being among the Florida at-large RNC delegates.The decision for Barron to join the rest of his family on the political stage has led to suggestions that the 18-year-old cannot be shielded from criticism because of his ageor actions.Allison Gill, political commentator and host of the Mueller, She Wrote podcast, posted on X, formerly Twitter, Barron was "no longer off limits" while sharing NBC News' report.X user Rob Voreck said Barron's move into the world of politics is "going to end very badly.""He's now fair game to the media. I'm actually surprised. I thought Melania would do everything to prevent this but if Barron, now an adult, personally made the decision to participate in his father's circus, so be it," Voreck added.Devin Nunes' Alt Mom, a popular parody social media account which purported to be the mother of the former California congressman, posted: "Barron Trump is officially fair game now."Another social media user added: "Barron Trump to step into the political arena as a Florida delegate at the Republican convention."Children are off limits. However, at 18, Barron is now considered an adult. Should Barron choose to enter the Republican political circus, it will be game on."Trump's office has been contacted for comment via email.Barron was recently part of headline news after the former president urged that the judge overseeing his hush money trial in New York grant him permission to miss one day of proceedings in order to attend the 18-year-old's high school graduation on May 17.Judge Juan Merchan has confirmed that the falsifying business records trial will be on hold on May 17, allowing Trump to attend his son's high school graduation in Florida.In a statement confirming that Barron will serve as a delegate, Power said: "We have a great delegation of grassroots leaders, elected officials and even Trump family members."Florida is continuing to have a great convention team, but more importantly we are preparing to win Florida and win it big."Link to Image
