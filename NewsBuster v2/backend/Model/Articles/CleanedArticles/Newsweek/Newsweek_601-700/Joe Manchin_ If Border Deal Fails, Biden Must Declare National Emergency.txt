The Senate remains embroiled in heated bipartisan border negotiations that could see the upper chamber vote on a deal by this week or next However, Speaker Mike Johnson has refrained from committing to put such an agreement for vote on the House floor if it doesn't go far enough in achieving conservative policy priorities aimed to curb migration and bolster enforcement If Johnson does indeed refuse a vote, one of the Senate's chief advocates of bipartisanship, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, said President Joe Biden must declare a national emergency "The President has a responsibility and, I think, an obligation that if Congress cannot, because of politics, consummate a deal, then he has to declare a national emergency," Manchin told Newsweek  "The border is probably the greatest crisis we face right now "Declaring a national emergency offers the president a unique array of powers not normally afforded to the office, including the ability to authorize military construction projects, enter national defense-related contracts, and deploy troops to coordinate relief efforts, among 145 other powers, as detailed by the Brennan Center for Justice Former President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in 2019 after Congress failed to reach a deal to fund the southwest border wall he desired, resulting in funds appropriated to the Department of Defense to be spent on the project Democratic leaders decried the effort, with Senate Leader Charles Schumer calling it a "lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency " When Biden took office, he terminated the declaration The situation at the border has shifted since Trump's office, as migrant crossing numbers have spiked, in part because of the economic and social unrest triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, advocacy groups say During the four financial years coinciding with Trump's presidency, total annual encounters between border officials and migrants, as reported by U S  Customs and Border Protection, fluctuated from around 304,000 to nearly 852,000  Over Biden's tenure, the annual encounters have ranged from roughly 1 73 million to nearly 2 48 million Politics surround a potential deal, however, as some Republicans fear an agreement could present a political win for Biden heading into the 2024 election  Republican Representative Troy Nehls of Texas said on CNN he's "not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help Joe Biden's approval rating " If Johnson holds a similar belief, a deal could be doomed Yet, if the House GOP does indeed prevent a deal from moving forward, declaring a national emergency would paint a significant contrast between Biden and a House GOP that does not want a bipartisan moving forward due to election-year politics  It could also provide some of the relief Manchin desires "There has to be security and we can't have this openness with hundreds of thousands of people coming through," Manchin told Newsweek  "It's dangerous, very dangerous, and it's a crisis "Link to Image
