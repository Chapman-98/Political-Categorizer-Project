A majority of Generation Z voters believe former President Donald Trump would shake up the country for the better if he returns to the White House following the November election, according to a new poll.Republicans have long struggled to gain support among young voters, who are generally viewed as more likely to embrace progressive or liberal policies. But recent polls of the 2024 electorate suggest that Trump, who remains the front-runner to win the Republican presidential nomination over former South Carolina Governor and United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, may be making inroads with Gen Z, a bloc of voters whose support is crucial to President Joe Biden's efforts to win a second term.A new Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released this week found that Gen Z voters believe Trump will have a positive impact by shaking up politics if he is victorious over Biden.The survey posed the question: "Do you think Donald Trump is someone who will shake up the country for the better or do you think he is a danger to democracy and will hopelessly divide the country if elected?"Among respondents between the ages of 18 and 24, 65 percent said they believe he would "shake up the country for the better," while only 35 percent view him as a "danger to democracy," according to the poll, which surveyed 2,022 registered voters from February 21 to 22.Every age group except for 65 or older agreed that Trump would shake up the country for good, but Gen Z had the largest majority of voters who said so, the survey found. Across all age groups, 56 percent of respondents said he would positively shake up the country, while 44 percent said they believe he is dangerous.The poll, which also found that some Democrats have warmed to Trump since 2020, comes as the latest warning sign for Biden's electoral chances among young voters.The president has fielded questions about his age, as critics question whether it is time for a new generation of leadership to take over the Democratic Party. His stances on issues such as student loan relief and the war between Israel and Hamas have alienated young voters, many of whom have pressed him to support a ceasefire in the conflict and that he hasn't done enough with loan relief.However, other polls have found Biden continuing to lead among young voters, and Trump's stance on issues such as Israel, student loans and climate change are also unlikely to alienate young voters who feel Biden has not lived up to their expectations on these policies.The poll found Trump leading among voters between the ages of 18 and 24, with 51 percent of them saying they plan to vote for the former president in November. Only 42 percent said they are voting for Biden, while another 7 percent remain undecided.Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign for comment via email.Link to Image
