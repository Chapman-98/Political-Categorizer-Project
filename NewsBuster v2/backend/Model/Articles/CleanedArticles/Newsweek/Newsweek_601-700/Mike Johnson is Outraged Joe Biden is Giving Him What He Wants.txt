House Speaker Mike Johnson is angry with President Joe Biden for considering changing his immigration policy like he had urged Biden to do, labeling the possible shift as "election year gimmicks "Johnson responded to the reports that Biden is weighing new executive action on the U S -Mexico border in a Thursday statement, criticizing the president for waiting until 2024 to consider cracking down on the record-breaking number of migrants who have arrived through the southern border Johnson said House Republicans have been "sounding the alarm" about Biden's "open-border policies" since he began his presidency in January 2021 and that he personally sent a letter demanding "immediate executive action" last year  He said that it wasn't until the country was "now in an election year," that Biden "suddenly seems interested in trying to make a change using the legal authority that he claimed until recently didn't exist ""Americans have lost faith in this president and won't be fooled by election year gimmicks that don't actually secure the border," Johnson said  "Nor will they forget that the president created this catastrophe and, until now, has refused to use his executive power to fix it "In response, the White House took aim at the speaker over his "wildly fluctuating excuses for opposing bipartisan border security legislation " White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates told Newsweek in a statement that the "only consistent theme" in Johnson's response to Biden's immigration policies "is that he is playing politics with the wellbeing of American families ""For six straight years, Speaker Johnson demanded border security legislation, only for House Republicans to balk as soon as they saw the strongest bipartisan border deal in modern history and kill it, explicitly citing Donald Trump's concerns that making America safer would diminish his campaign," Bates said This week, new reports emerged that Biden was considering taking executive action to address the border crisis after congressional Republicans blocked the border legislation backed by the White House earlier this month The Biden administration has repeatedly criticized Johnson for refusing to take up the $95 3 billion supplemental spending package that was approved by bipartisan lawmakers in the Senate  The GOP resistance to the bill was largely influenced by Trump's opposition to the package that combined Ukraine aid to border security Reports say that Biden is considering using Section 212(f) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act—the same provision Trump used to ban the entry of individuals from majority-Muslim nations—to curb the influx of immigration at the southern border "If these reports are true and the president intends to take action, he can show he's serious by changing more than asylum policy," Johnson said  "He should begin by reinstituting the 'Remain in Mexico' policy and ending his administration's abuse of the parole system, along with other critical reforms "Biden ended the Trump-era "Remain in Mexico" policy in February 2021 The reports that Biden could change his immigration policy come as the president faces an uphill battle for reelection in November  Immigration has emerged as a key issue for Biden's campaign A recent Newsweek poll conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies found that 59 percent of American's are unhappy with the government's handling of the issue  Compared to an earlier poll from November, support for the Biden administration's immigration approach dropped 2 percent while dissatisfaction rose by 9 percent Democrats are still hoping that immigration won't be enough to derail a second Biden term Tom Suozzi's win in New York's special election this month had been seen as a victory for Democrats in a swing state where Republicans had fiercely attacked Suozzi over his immigration record Bates reiterated that optimistic tone on Thursday, saying, "As they proved in New York's special election, Americans absolutely reject House Republicans' prioritization of cheap politics over the safety of their constituents "Bates also criticized Johnson and House Republicans for not returning to Congress to pass the border bill sooner, slamming their 2-week break as a "vacation" and saying that, "The American people can't afford to wait for House Republican leadership to finish enjoying their $900 suites at the Mandarin Hotel " Lawmakers in the House are expected to return to the Capitol on February 28 Link to Image
