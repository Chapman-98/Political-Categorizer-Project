Donald Trump lost over 500,000 votes to Nikki Haley during Tuesday's GOP primaries, despite the former South Carolina governor dropping out of the race, with tens of thousands of other votes going against the former president Trump, who is already the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, continued his domination in the GOP primaries in Florida, Ohio, Arizona, Illinois and Kansas on March 19 But despite him being the clear winner, Haley—who officially suspended her White House bid in the wake of Super Tuesday—still managed to achieve between 10 and 20 percent of the vote across the five states  While a significant number of these ballots may have been cast before she dropped out of the race, the results are another indication that Trump is struggling to unite Republican voters beyond his MAGA base Haley was seen as a more moderate Republican candidate, who was able to garner support from key independent voters as well as the so-called "Never Trump" brigade  Some polls have indicated that a majority of Haley supporters will not go on to vote for Trump in the 2024 election against President Joe Biden, suggesting the former president will not have enough support from the general population to win November's race In Florida, where Trump now spends most of his time, he won the primary with 81 percent, amounting to more than 910,000 votes, with Haley second on nearly 14 percent (155,461 votes)  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis—who dropped out of the race after the first-in-the-nation Iowa Caucus in January—finished in third with 3 7 percent (41,233) of votes With a majority of the ballots tallied in the key swing state of Arizona, Trump won with more than 450,000 votes (77 9 percent), but Haley achieved over 108,000 votes (18 6 percent)  DeSantis and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who also dropped out the race in January, won more than 14,000 votes between them in Arizona In Illinois, Trump achieved more than 469,500 (80 7 percent) votes  Haley won more than 83,500 (14 3 percent), and over 25,000 people voted for DeSantis and Christie In Kansas, Trump came out on top with 75 percent of the votes (over 70,000), with Haley achieving 16 percent (more than 15,000)  DeSantis won just over 2,400 votes, with "none of the names shown" coming in third place with more than 4,800 votes In Ohio, Trump won with just over 79 percent of the vote (more than 889,000), with the former South Carolina governor getting just over 14 percent (161,357)  DeSantis came in third with over 37,000 votes, with Christie still receiving nearly 20,000 votes The 500,000-plus votes that Haley achieved on Tuesday is in addition to the near three million votes she won in the previous GOP primary races  This includes more than two million across Super Tuesday, where Haley won the strong blue state of Vermont Even after dropping out of the race, Haley still managed toreceive more than 77,000 votes (13 percent) in the key swing state of Georgia in the March 12 primary While sharing the results from Tuesday's GOP primaries, the Republicans Against Trump social media account, which has more than 620,000 followers on X, formerly Twitter, posted: "One thing is clear, there's a substantial segment of voters in the Republican party who will never vote for Trump "Harry Sisson, who is part of a Biden administration initiative to promote the president's 2024 campaign on social media, posted on X: "Republicans around the country are turning against Donald Trump  We're seeing it everyday  Lifelong conservatives won't put up with his insanity anymore "To moderate Republicans, conservatives, and Nikki Haley voters: we'll welcome you with open arms to the Biden side "Trump's and Haley's offices have been contacted for comment via email In the wake of the March 12 GOP primary results, Marc Thiessen, former chief speechwriter for President George W  Bush, suggested that Trump may lose the 2024 Election against Biden if Haley supporters do not go on to vote for him in November "The Haley voters are the swing voters of the 2024 election," Thiessen told Fox News  "Trump has to win them over, he has to pivot now to the general election and focus on uniting the party and the non-MAGA part of the GOP "What Trump needs to understand is that MAGA voters are not going to decide this election "Christopher Borick, a professor of political science and director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, previously said Haley's supporters will go on to play a "significant, and perhaps determinative role" in the outcome of the general election These include the majority of Haley's supporters who will "grudgingly" vote for Trump in November "But for Haley supporters who are independents or alienated Republicans, the general election choice is less clear," Borick told Newsweek "If they were drawn to Haley out of a desire to stop Trump, that incentive will likely manifest in a vote for Biden this fall  But if they were drawn to Haley by her brand of politics or her identity, their ultimate choice this fall may be to sit it out or consider a third-party option "Link to
