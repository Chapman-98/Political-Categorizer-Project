Taylor Swift's cultural impact is undebatable, and she also has a growing influence on politics Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the GOP presidential primary, and President Joe Biden are continuing to campaign around the country Saturday polling analysis by Real Clear Polling suggests that in November's election, should Trump get the Republican nomination, he would receive 47 3 percent of the vote compared to incumbent Joe Biden, who would receive 43 percent  Other recent polls have narrower margins  A poll last week for The Economist by YouGov predicted Trump will get 44 percent of the vote to Biden's 43 percent To help improve Biden's numbers, the Biden campaign is hoping to secure Swift's endorsement in 2024, according to reports in The New York Times  Newsweek has contacted Swift's publicist for comment via email Tuesday While the "Cruel Summer" singer has only recently dipped her toe into politics, it's clear why any politician would want her on their side  When Swift urged her Instagram followers to register to vote in September, more than 35,000 people did so Exclusive polling conducted for Newsweek by Redfield & Wilton Strategies found that 18 percent of voters say they're "more likely" or "significantly more likely" to vote for a candidate endorsed by Swift Seventeen percent said they would be less likely to vote for a Swift-backed candidate, while 55 percent would be neither more nor less likely to do so  The survey, which had a sample size of 1,500 eligible voters, was conducted on January 18 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 53 percent "She's influenced popular culture, sports, the economics of entire regions of the U S ," communications consultant James Haggerty told Newsweek  "So why not politics and elections?"While Swift doesn't regularly speak about Biden, she previously endorsed Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in 2020  She uploaded a postto X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram of her cover of V Magazine as part of their V is for Vote campaign, released on October 7, 2020 The pop superstar posted it alongside a photo of her holding a plate of decorated cookies designed to look like the pair's campaign logo  She wrote in the caption: "I spoke to @vmagazine about why I'll be voting for Joe Biden for president  So apt that it's come out on the night of the VP debate  Gonna be watching and supporting @KamalaHarris by yelling at the tv a lot  And I also have custom cookies "Her statement in the magazine read: "The change we need most is to elect a president who recognizes that people of color deserve to feel safe and represented, that women deserve the right to choose what happens to their bodies, and that the LGBTQIA+ community deserves to be acknowledged and included  Everyone deserves a government that takes global health risks seriously and puts the lives of its people first  The only way we can begin to make things better is to choose leaders who are willing to face these issues and find ways to work through them "I will proudly vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in this year's presidential election  Under their leadership, I believe America has a chance to start the healing process it so desperately needs "In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in December of that year, Swift recalled the moment she found out that Biden had won the 2020 election  She was directing a video shoot when she got the notification on her phone and described it as a "moment of quiet, cautious elation and relief ""I was hanging out with my photographer friend, Beth, and the wonderful couple that owned the farm where we [were]  And we realized really early into the night that we weren't going to get an accurate picture of the results," she explained "Then, a couple of days later, I was on a video shoot, but I was directing, and I was standing there with my face shield and mask on next to my director of photography, Rodrigo Prieto "And I just remember a news alert coming up on my phone that said, 'Biden is our next president  He's won the election ' And I showed it to Rodrigo and he said, 'I'm always going to remember the moment that we learned this ' And I looked around, and people's face shields were starting to fog up because a lot of people were really misty-eyed and emotional, and it was not loud  It wasn't popping bottles of champagne  It was this moment of quiet, cautious elation and relief "Swift has also used social media to express her disapproval of Trump a variety of times in the past  In May 2020, before that year's election had taken place, she took to X to criticize his tweets about Black Lives Matter protesters in Minnesota "After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? 'When the looting starts the shooting starts'??? We will vote you out in November  @realdonaldtrump," she wrote In August of that same year, Swift focused on Trump's handling of U S  Postal Service funding and criticized him for allegedly withholding billions of dollars in funding "Trump's calculated dismantling of USPS proves one thing clearly: He is WELL AWARE that we do not want him as our president  He's chosen to blatantly cheat and put millions of Americans' lives at risk in an effort to hold on to power," she posted to X She added: "Donald Trump's ineffective leadership gravely worsened the crisis that we are in and he is now taking advantage of it to subvert and destroy our right to vote and vote safely  Request a ballot early  Vote early "Swift's entrance into politics has been relatively recent as she previously feared isolating her audience  But things changed in 2018, when she endorsed former Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, in the Senate race against Republican candidate Marsha Blackburn Link to Image
