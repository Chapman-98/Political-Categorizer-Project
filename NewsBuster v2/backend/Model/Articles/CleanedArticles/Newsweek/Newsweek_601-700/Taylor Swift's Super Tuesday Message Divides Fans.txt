Taylor Swift's Super Tuesday message urging her Instagram followers to vote on Super Tuesday divided her fans Voters in 16 states and one U S  territory are heading to the polls to make their decision in the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries on Tuesday, as President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump aim to solidify their leads in the crucial nominating contests Swift took to Instagram on Tuesday morning to urge her fans, known as the "Swifties," to vote in their states' primaries "I wanted to remind you guys to vote the people who most represent YOU into power  If you haven't already, make a plan to vote today," Swift wrote  "Whether you're in Tennessee or somewhere else in the US, check your polling places and times at Vote org "Her Super Tuesday message was met with a mixed reaction from her fanbase, some of whom criticized her for not endorsing a specific candidate or using her platform to call for a ceasefire in the conflict between Israel and Hamas Newsweek reached out to a spokesperson for Swift for comment via email "Saying 'vote!' when you have every biden bootlicker and trump toe-sucker wrapped around your finger right now is laughably disappointing  taylor swift actually take a stance on ANYTHING challenge oh my god," wrote X user @hairpinsdropped "I think she needs to learn that just simply telling people to vote is not the needed activism that we need from people with her platform," Taylor Swift fan account @evermoreIakes wrote "I love Taylor Swift for still encouraging people to vote especially young people, but if she can do this- she can speak on a genocide right???!" wrote @the4lchemy X user @ernrnastones said: "Kinda want her to shut up and never speak about elections again "Other fans, however, defended Swift and praised her for encouraging fans to get involved in the political process "Taylor swift could make every move she makes picture perfect, by the book, to a T, and yet y'all would still tell her she breathed the wrong way  the standard you hold her to is beyond typical human  i'm so sick of keyboard warriors and couch activists," posted @corneliastagain "Twitter activists holding taylor swift to the highest political standards but not the actual politicians and nation leaders, nothing new," wrote @paigeysickofit "Taylor swift is not your savior  if you want change go ahead and start fighting for it bring voices in your community together start real conversations in your community and you do in fact need to vote as she said for who REPRESENTS YOU!" wrote @paigelovests Swift's political beliefs have long been a point of speculation, as the Is It Over Now? singer largely remained quiet about politics until 2018, when she endorsed Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen in Tennessee  She has also voiced support for the LGBTQ+ community and abortion rights Some people have speculated she may endorse Biden ahead of the November general election, but thus far she has not said who she is supporting for president  She did, however, endorse him in the 2020 presidential election Link to Image
