Nice!" someone else commented A fourth person added: "A good year for film "Others said they were no longer interested in the awards show, with some adding that they no longer feel special "Once the only time you saw movie stars being themselves was at the Oscars  They avoided talk shows and movie magazines were usually studio-fabricated  But now you can't avoid movie stars—they're on the cover of every magazine, etc  This makes the Oscars less special," a different X user posted to the platform "I stopped watching award shows decades ago  Maybe I'm just overly sensitive to overpaid people stroking egos and wearing clothes/jewelry that cost more than my house  Perhaps I'm jealous  Perhaps not  Either way, I enjoy films/TV, but don't GAF about some award show," said another "Gee and there has been such a lot of low quality stuff coming out recently Mr King    what are the chances of The Dark Tower as a series one day   ? The film was just not good enough to do the books any Justice, I recently found The Wind through the Keyhole and really enjoyed it!" someone else wrote A fourth added: "I only watch it for the fashion lol "Update 03/11/2024 at 2:16 a m  ET  This article was updated with additional information Link to Image
