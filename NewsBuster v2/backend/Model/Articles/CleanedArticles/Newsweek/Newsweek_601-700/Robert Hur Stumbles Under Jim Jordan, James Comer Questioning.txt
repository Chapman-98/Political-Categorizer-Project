Former Special Counsel Robert Hur stumbled to answer House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan when he was questioned him about what motivated President Joe Biden to remove classified documents from the White House During Tuesday's hearing, Jordan asked Hur why Biden chose to take documents with him when he left the vice presidency, to which Hur responded that the "why" wasn't addressed by the report "I think you told us, Mr  Hur," Jordan said  "Page 231, you said this: 'President Biden had strong motivations'—that's a keyword  We're getting a motive now  'President Biden had strong motivations to ignore the proper procedures for safeguarding the classified information in his notebook ' Why did he have strong motivations?
