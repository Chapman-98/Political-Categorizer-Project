Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert has said that former Donald Trump aide Steve Bannon is considered a "god" In conversation with Boebert on his War Room podcast, Bannon said he will be taking part in an event and live show in Colorado's 4th congressional district  This is where Boebert intends to run for a new seat in 2024  She is vying to replace GOP Rep  Ken Buck, who said he would not be seeking reelection this year Speaking on the show, Boebert said: "I got to give a shoutout to the posse here  Steve Bannon is loved all throughout America  I travel all the states, and I hear about you  But, in eastern Colorado, you are their superstar  You know, maybe you are their God with a little 'g '"Boebert added that "everyone" in the 4th district is "so excited by everything that you are doing, so they are going to be excited to see you out there "Newsweek has contacted Boebert for comment via email outside of normal working hours Boebert's move to Colorado's 4th district, which has around 720,000 residents and is a solid red area of the state, means she will not need to go through a rematch with Democrat Adam Frisch, whom she beat by 546 votes in the U S  House elections in 2022  It was the narrowest margin of victory of all House Republicans in that year's election The bid for a new district could be a comfortable win if Buck's record is anything to go by; he beat his Democratic opponent in 2022 with more than 86,000 votes  However, Buck represents a more moderate type of Republican politics, something Boebert does not  He is not standing for reelection due to dissatisfaction with the far-right sect of the party continuing to claim that Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 presidential election,Boebert will also have to contend with a number of scandals and mishaps that have befallen her since she took office  Most recently, her 18-year-old son Tyler was arrested on charges of criminal possession of ID, conspiracy to commit a felony, and over 15 additional misdemeanor and petty offenses Despite this, Boebert, a long-time supporter of former president Donald Trump, was also recently endorsed by him "She has led the fight to Impeach Joe Biden, Stop Illegal Immigration, Defend the Second Amendment, Protect our Wonderful Ranchers and Farmers, Support our Military and Veterans, Secure our Natural Resources to Pursue Energy Dominance, and Stand Up to the Radical Democrats who want to Destroy our Beautiful Country," Trump wrote in a post on his social-media site TruthSocial on March 2 Link to Image
