Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday railed against Fox News over the presence of certain Republican voices that have been critical of him While Trump andthe conservative Fox News networkhave generally been on good terms throughout his political career, he has, in recent years, become increasingly critical of it owing to a number of factors  Among these grievances has been its occasional featuring of Republican figures who are critical of him and his impact on the GOP, whom Trump has often derided as "RINOs," or "Republicans in Name Only "On Tuesday, Trump took to Truth Social to rail against Fox News for this once again, prompted by a segment featuring Marc Thiessen, who previously served as a speechwriter for former President George W  Bush  During the appearance, Thiessen claimed that Joe Biden is the most unpopular president in U S  history, but argued that Trump can still lose to him in November "If you think he can't win, I got two words for you, Senator Fetterman  I mean, the voters have said that if they don't like the GOP alternative, they will vote for a guy who just had a stroke, who had a debate where he couldn't put a coherent sentence together," Thiessen said  "And Donald Trump is the only person who's less popular than Joe Biden is Donald Trump  A lot of people don't want this choice  And so it could go either way "In reaction to this segment, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that Fox News should stop featuring Thiessen, as well as another former Bush official, Karl Rove "How many times is FoxNews going to put on RINO Bush apologist Marc Thiessen," Trump wrote  "He was wrong about me in 2016, and in 2020 I got more votes than any sitting President in history, but the Election was RIGGED  My record on Endorsements is unmatched by anyone, EVER! Put on people who understand what is going on in politics   And while you're at it, GET RID OF KARL ROVE!!!"Newsweek reached out to Fox News via email on Tuesday evening for comment  Any responses received will be added to this story in a later update Despite his claims, Trump's record for endorsements has come under scrutiny in years  Candidates that he endorsed for key congressional elections in key swing states in the 2022 midterm elections lost many of their races to Democrats, with Trump's influence being highlighted as a potential reason Republicans failed to retake the Senate that year and retook the House with only a slim margin Link to Image
