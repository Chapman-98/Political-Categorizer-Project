Ted Cruz faces an uphill battle in his appeal for Democratic voters to back his Texas Senate re-election campaign, polling suggests.On Wednesday, the Republican announced the "Democrats for Cruz" coalition, which aims to persuade those on the left to vote for Cruz in November while citing issues such as border security.The group, which features both current and former Texas Democratic officials, was announced the dayafter Rep. Colin Allred was confirmed as the Democratic candidate hoping to take Cruz's seat.While Cruz is considered the favorite to win re-election to the Senate in November's election, at least two polls have suggested that Allred and Cruz are neck-and-neck, meaning the Texas race could once again be one of the most closely watched in the country.In 2018, Cruz narrowly beat former congressman Beto O'Rourke by just 2.6 percent to win reelection in what was at the time the mostexpensive Senate race in U.S. history."I am proud to launch the start of my new coalition, Democrats for Cruz," the GOP Senator postedon X, formerly Twitter."This race is about making sure that we keep Texas, Texas, no matter what it takes. Because as Texas goes, so goes the nation."In February, a Redfield and Wilton Strategies poll,conducted for Newsweek, found that 39 percent of Texans either approve or "strongly" approve of Cruz's job as Senator.However, when broken down further, the polls also showed that 70 percent of Texans who voted for President Joe Biden in 2020 disapprove or "strongly" disapprove of Cruz, meaning suggesting the senator has his work cut out if he wants their votes come November.Cruz's office has been contacted for comment via email.The "Democrats for Cruz" launch also featured video containing Democratic figures such as former Laredo Mayor Pete Saenz Jr and Presidio County Sheriff Danny Dominguez explaining why they are now supporting the Republican.Speaking to the San Antonio Express-News, Cruz said that those who have joined the campaign "know that today's Democrat Party is not what it used to be.""They understand that electing a radical leftist like Colin Allred would be catastrophic to our state and nation, because this race is not about Republican or Democrat," Cruz said. "It is about making sure that we keep Texas, Texas, no matter what it takes."Elsewhere, a previous University of Texas at Tyler (UTT) survey found that Cruz and Allred were tied on 41 percent in the race for the Senate seat, with a National Public Affairs poll of likely voters also showing the Republican and Allred were tied at 44 percent.However, forecasters Race to the White House suggest Cruz is the clear frontrunner in the Texas Senate race, giving the Republican a 70.5 percent chance of winning November's election, with Allred given a 29 percent chance.In February, a Texas Politics Project poll also showed Cruz ahead of Allred by 14 points (46 to 32 percent).Link to Image
