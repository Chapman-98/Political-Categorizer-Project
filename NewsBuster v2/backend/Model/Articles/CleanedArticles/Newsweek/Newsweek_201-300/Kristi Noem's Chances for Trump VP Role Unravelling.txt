South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem's chances of being the next vice president appear to be rapidly dwindling amid the controversy surrounding her upcoming book For months, Noem was seen as one of the frontrunnersto be named as Donald Trump's 2024 running mate, amid reports the former president would choose a female partner for his latest White House bid to sweep up women voters he lost in the last election and broaden the Republican ticket's appeal However, Noem's chances of being Trump's running mate, as well as her overall political status, seem to have been severely damaged after extracts from her book revealed how she shot her 14-month old pet dog, Cricket, because of its aggressive behavior  Noem later doubled down on the controversy, saying the decision to kill the farm dog because it was "untrainable" was proof of her tough political acumen and how she has never "passed on my responsibilities to anyone" even if they are "hard and painful "In the wake of the extracts about killing her dog, online betting companies have slashed Noem's chances of being Trump's running mate, with reports suggesting the former president has repeatedly criticized the South Dakota governor for talking about why she killed her pet more than 20 years ago Polymarket, a platform where users can place "yes" or "no" bets on the likelihood of world events, placed Noem as the second favorite to be Trump's next running in late April, giving her a 10 percent chance  In the wake of the dog killing controversy, these odds have since been dramatically reduced to just a 2 percent chance, with Noem at risk of falling out of Polymarket's top 10 shortlist of candidates altogether Elsewhere, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich recently suggested that Noem "killing the dog and then writing about it ended any possibility of her being picked as VP "There have also beenreports inRolling Stone, not verified by Newsweek, that Trump has been frequently "disgusted" by Noem writing about shooting her dog and suggesting that she has a poor grasp of "public relations "The report, citing unmanned sources, also claims Trump has been specifically asking "why would she do that?" and "what is wrong with her?" with regards to Noem writing about killing her dog Trump's and Noem's offices have been contacted for comment via email The controversy surrounding Noem's upcoming book No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward did not end with the story about killing her dog More recently, Noem's team admitted that a passage of the book where the she discussed meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while she served in the House Armed Services Committee during her time as a congresswoman did not occur "I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un," Noem wrote  "I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all) "Noem's spokesperson Ian Fury has since said that the passage about meeting the North Korea leader is inaccurate and will be removed from the book "It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book No Going Back has two small errors," Fury told The New York Times  "This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor  Kim Jong-un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been "Second ErrorThe second error involves a conversation between Noem and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley  Fury said a passage will be amended to reflect the tone of the talk, and state that it happened in 2020, not 2021 as suggested in the book, according to Politico In a recent interview on CBS' Face the Nation,Noem dismissed the criticisms against her from GOP figures such as Gingrich while once again defending her actions "I would say about Republicans criticizing me, these are the same Republicans that criticized me during COVID  They criticized me when I've made other decisions in South Dakota to protect my state," Noem said  "My state today is extremely happy and thriving "This was a dangerous animal that was killing livestock and attacking people  And I had little children at the time," she added  "Our operation had many kids running around and people in interaction with the public  And I made a difficult choice "In February, Noem told Fox News that she and Trump have "never had that conversation" about her potentially being his 2024 running mate Link to Image
