The birth of a child, a joyous event for many families, sometimes tragically ends with the death of the mother  Though rare, maternal mortality has devastating effects on couples, families and communities While working as a physician in Kenya, I cared for a woman who hemorrhaged at another hospital and was transported to my medical facility  By the time she arrived, she had suffered cardiac arrest twice  Despite intensive interventions, we could not resuscitate her  Both she and her baby died Even in the United States, where minority women have access to advanced medical technology and well-trained nurses, midwives, and physicians, they are particularly at risk of passing away before, during, or after childbirth  As both a minority woman and an OBGYN with more than 30 years of experience caring for underserved women, I've seen firsthand the unique challenges women of color face during pregnancy During my years of research and practice in international and domestic settings, I've also found that many are quick to mischaracterize maternal mortality trends and suggest overly politicized solutions that are inconsistent with the facts If we do not identify the causes of maternal mortality correctly, we are going to lose more mothers and babies Though the overall maternal mortality rate appears to have increased over recent years, this increase can be attributed to improvements in tracking maternal deaths  Even so, the CDC's most recent data reveal the maternal mortality rate among black women to be 2 6 times higher than the rate for white women  Comparatively, African American women remain at higher overall risk for death in pregnancy than other women When explaining this higher mortality rate, identity politics quickly becomes a roadblock to helping minority women survive pregnancy  Well-intentioned individuals in media, health care, and government frequently cite climate change, lack of access to abortion, and systemic racism as causes of these tragic deaths  In doing so, they fail to deeply consider the existing data on this important issue The truth is that there are at least as many risk factors that contribute to maternal mortality as there are misleading theories for the disparity, each affecting different groups in different ways  Research shows that a higher proportion of African American women, for example, pass away from clots in their lungs or pregnancy-related hypertension compared with white women, while a higher proportion of white women die from stroke or infection compared with black women  Likewise, more Hispanic women suffer from fatal hemorrhage than black or white women Maternal deaths among minority women may also be caused by underlying risk factors unrelated to their ethnicity  Medical studies consistently show that women of all backgrounds who give birth at an older age, for example, are at higher risk of complications  Mental health conditions are a significant contributor to maternal mortality  A review of data from 14 U S  states revealed that mental health conditions were the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths  In the state of Indiana, white women account for nearly 90 percent of the maternal mortality deaths attributed to overdose Despite the wide array of conditions and behaviors responsible for pregnancy-related mortality, minority women are led to believe that greater access to abortion is the solution to preventing maternal death  Nothing could be further from the truth  In fact, an eight-year study of California Medicaid recipients found that in the year following an abortion, a woman is 162 percent more likely to die from all causes than after childbirth  It also revealed that after abortion, mothers are 182 percent more likely to die in an accident and 254 percent more likely to commit suicide  One study even noted that, after gestational age at abortion, the most significant risk factor for death associated with abortion was ethnicity  Women of color are 2 4 times as likely to die from abortion as white women, a fact that mirrors the black-white disparity in childbirth mortality These data suggest that abortion itself may be a factor contributing to maternal mortality among minority women, as black women have undergone induced abortion at a rate four times that of white women for the past three decades  It's my hope that abortion as a "solution" becomes unthinkable, for it has already done black women, their children, and society immense harm If we truly want to reduce mortality among minority mothers, we must offer them holistic care that affirms their dignity and protects their health  So far, the medical community has made tremendous strides in dramatically decreasing the number of in-hospital deaths  Now we must turn our attention beyond the delivery room, to the year before birth, and the first year after birth We must inform women of underlying risk factors for adverse outcomes, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, before they conceive  Mothers could also benefit from education on sexual risk avoidance and warning signs in pregnancy, diet and exercise coaching, resources to overcome substance abuse, and increased postpartum support  There's evidence that improving pregnant women's access to transportation and housing could help them not only survive pregnancy but thrive after giving birth  All of these need the engagement of not just health professionals but policymakers and civil society Hyper-fixation on racial discrimination and other political causes as the reasons for pregnancy-related mortality keeps us from seeing the nuances in maternal mortality disparities  Only if we de-politicize the maternal mortality issue, grapple with risk factors, help women engage in positive behaviors, and focus on effective interventions will we finally reduce maternal mortality among the most vulnerable  The stakes could not be higher for mothers, children, and families in all
