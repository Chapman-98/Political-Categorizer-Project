Bestselling author Stephen King has continued to share other people's withering descriptions of Rep  Marjorie Taylor Greene, days after his social media post in which the Georgia Republican was dubbed "Moscow Marjorie "Greene has blasted members of her own party after the House passed a Ukraine aid bill on Saturday  As Ukraine continues to fight against the full-scale invasion that Russian President Vladimir Putin launched in February 2022, the U S  has been a key ally to Kyiv  Saturday's bill will provide over $60 billion in foreign aid to help restock Ukraine's arsenal After months of U S  lawmakers urging GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson to take up legislation that would help fund Ukraine, the Louisiana Republican was finally able to get it passed by a 311-112 vote, with a large number of Democrats helping Republicans push it across the finish line  The bill also provides military aid to Israel, replenishes U S  weapons systems and gives humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza Upon leaving the Capitol on Saturday, Greene told reporters: "This is the sellout of America today  When we had members of Congress in there waving the Ukrainian flag on the United States House of Representatives floor while we're doing nothing to secure our border, I think every American in this country should be furious "On Wednesday, The New York Times published an op-ed headlined: "The Humbling of Marjorie Taylor Greene " In the piece, writer Michelle Cottle tackled Greene's calls for Johnson to resign over the foreign aid package Cottle wrote: "In our Trump-era politics, there's always the question of how crazy is too crazy—how disruptive and extreme an elected official can get before becoming so embarrassing that members of her own team feel compelled to abandon her?""Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene seems to have reached that outer limit  Again," Cottle went on  "It's not simply that Ms  Greene has taken such a Putin-pleasing approach to Russia's war in Ukraine (Ukrainian Nazis? Really?) that the term 'useful idiot' feels unavoidable "She has, in very little time, undermined the influence of her party's entire right flank, driving less unhinged Republicans—most notably the House speaker, Mike Johnson—to brush back her and her ilk like the poo-flinging chaos monkeys they are "The cutting article was subsequently later referenced by King, who wrote in a post shared on X, formerly Twitter: "[Michelle] Cottle on MTG: "A poo-flinging chaos [monkey] "Newsweek has contacted a representative of Greene via email for comment Days earlier, horror author King shared another comment made about Greene On Friday, former Republican Rep  Ken Buck, who has previously referred to Greene as "Moscow Marjorie," appeared on CNN  When host Erica Hill played the former representative a clip of a Russian television personality recently claiming that "Speaker Johnson is not the one who is running Congress; Marjorie Taylor Greene is running Congress  Everyone is afraid of her "Buck then responded: "Well, 'Moscow Marjorie' has reached a new low  She is just mouthing the Russian propaganda and really hurting American foreign policy in the process  She's acting completely irresponsibly  And, again, when history looks at this period of time, Russia invaded Ukraine, Ukraine is fighting for its freedom, and we should be with the freedom fighters in this war "King then waded into the conversation over the weekend, writing in post on X: "Republican Ken Buck has dubbed MTG 'Moscow Marjorie '"There has been a history of King calling out Greene online  He previously criticized the politician on X after she appeared on Tucker Carlson's show Tucker on X in December to discuss the state of U S  politics During her appearance, Greene criticized the White House claiming that "Washington doesn't care about normal Americans and normal American ideas and normal American values "Greene shared a clip of the interview, captioning it: "If you don't fund the foreign wars, if you don't wear their flag, and if you don't have a sign outside your office door, you're going against Washington, against the Pentagon, and against the military industrial complex  And you will pay the price "King slammed Greene's stance by retweeting her post and adding: "Putin loves fools like you "He also criticized Greene on November 5 when she posted inaccurate information amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict "Israel is literally dominating in their war with Hamas after being brutally attacked killing thousands of innocent people, and not one single American dollar has been spent on that war yet  Just think about that," she wrote on X Plenty of people were quick to fire back at the outspoken representative, including King: "Are you tripping? We've given them aid and armaments for decades "Link to Image
