The Miami Grand Prix organizers have banned a planned fundraising event for Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign within their paddock suite facilities. The event, orchestrated by real estate mogul Steven Witkoff, was stopped following a Cease and Desist directive, citing a breach in suite usage terms.The intended fundraiser at the Miami Grand Prix set to support Donald Trump's campaign for the 2024 Presidential election has been called off by event organizers. This decision came to light after it was revealed that the use of a paddock suite for such purposes contravened the terms agreed upon by the parties involved. Paddock suites at F1 races are premium spaces that offer views close to the racing action, generally reserved for team hosts or sponsors, making them a coveted spot for any gathering.In response to the planned event, Grand Prix officials swiftly issued a Cease And Desist to Steven Witkoff. The directive clearly stated the non-compliance with the suite's intended use and expressly barred any form of fundraising or campaigning in the area. It was emphasized that non-compliance would not only stop the event but would also lead to Witkoff's possible exclusion from the race weekend.The letter, which was obtained by The Washington Post, read:"It has come to our attention that you may be using your Paddock Club Rooftop Suite for a political purpose, namely raising money for a federal election at $250,000 per ticket, which clearly violates the Formula 1 Crypto.com Miami Grand Prix suite license agreement."If this is true, we regret to inform you that your suite license will be revoked, you will not be allowed to attend the race at any time, and we will refund you in full."Witkoff, known for his support of Trump and his deep ties in the real estate sector, had priced the fundraising tickets at a staggering $250,000 each. However, when questioned about the fundraiser, Witkoff dismissed the sourcing claims as "fake", though without further elaboration.Adding to the political celebrity aura, Donald Trump himself is expected to attend the Miami Grand Prix. This visit is under special arrangements with the involvement of the Secret Service, indicative of the high security that accompanies a former president. Notably, Trump's appearance continues a somewhat recent tradition of presidential figures appearing at major American motorsport events. For instance, Trump attended the Daytona 500 in 2020, and other notable figures like former President Bill Clinton and Former First Lady Michelle Obama have attended F1 races.Steven Witkoff's recent activities also include his testimony in a civil court case against Trump, where the former president was fined $350 million for financial misconduct. Despite those serious proceedings, Witkoff has consistently shown staunch support for Trump.The intersection of sports, business, and politics often leads to complex situations such as the one unfolding at the Miami Grand Prix.Link to Image
