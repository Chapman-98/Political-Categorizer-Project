Former President Donald Trump's ex-adviser, Kimberly Guilfoyle, generated a wave of jokes Monday afternoon after she introduced her new children's book, The Princess and her Pup.Guilfoyle's announcement comes on the heels of the backlash faced by Kristi Noem, South Dakota governor and rumored Trump vice-presidential pick, for her admission that she killed one of her own dogs in a gravel pit after a pheasant-hunting trip.Guilfoyle, fiancee of Donald Trump Jr., primarily sparked mockery on X, formerly Twitter, for the timing of the book's release."The timing of this book. It's like the GOP is one giant SNL skit. I really hope the princess's pup doesn't end up with a gunshot wound to the head in a gravel pit," Meghan Maureen wrote on X.Lawyer Bradley P. Moss said on X, "Keep Governor Noem away from it.""That's a lovely Foreword that Kristi Noem wrote for you. 'everyone loves puppies,'" wrote the @finfox2 X account."Are you sending an autographed copy to @GovKristiNoem? Dedicate it to Cricket," @MilenaAmit replied to Guilfoyle on X.Newsweek reached out to Guilfoyle Monday afternoon via the BRAVE Books company website for further comment about the timing of the book's release.Last week, British newspaper The Guardian published an excerpt of Noem's coming book, No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward, in which the governor shared an account of shooting the 14-month-old puppy named Cricket, which she wrote had an "aggressive personality."On the way home from the hunting trip, Cricket escaped Noem's truck and attacked a family's chickens, "grabb[ing] one chicken at a time, crunching it to death with one bite, then dropping it to attack another." This made the chickens' owner cry and Noem paid them while also helping clean the mess the dog had made. She added that when she grabbed Cricket, the dog "whipped around to bite me.""At that moment," Noem wrote, "I realized I had to put her down."The governor also wrote that she "hated that dog," describing it as "untrainable" and "dangerous to anyone she came in contact with."Since the release of the passage, Noem has faced scorn from both Republicans and Democrats.Noem responded to the criticism on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday, writing: "I can understand why some people are upset about a 20-year-old story of Cricket, one of the working dogs at our ranch, in my upcoming bookâ€”No Going Back. The book is filled with many honest stories of my life, good and bad days, challenges, painful decisions, and lessons learned."Noem also contended that she "followed the law and was being a responsible parent, dog owner, and neighbor."Guilfoyle described her book on X as a "heartfelt story that teaches children that it's easier to be courageous with a friend by your side." She said 10 percent of all proceeds will go to Furry Friends Adoption, Clinic & Ranch, a no-kill animal shelter in Jupiter, Florida.Link to Image
