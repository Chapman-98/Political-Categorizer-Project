As a dog lover, that is just too much for me  You don't kill a dog because it's 'useless ' She could have found a loving home for the dog  My dogs are the loves of my life  I would be devastated without them "The anonymous social media account @catturd2, which has amassed more than 2 million followers for its MAGA posts, posted, "There's nothing you can say to justify shooting an 18-month-old puppy in the face and killing it  NOTHING! I don't give AF what it did In a separate post, the account added: "Just so you know     If you find a dog 'untrainable' and you feel like the only answer is to shoot it in cold blood - I'll gladly take the dog to live on the Catturd ranch until I can find - a loving home  All my abused rescues are so hard to take care of at first but if you give them maximum love, eventually, they'll turn into the most beautiful, loving gifts you'll ever know "Matthew Nichol, a MAGA account with over 38,000 followers, posted to X, "I do not care if she is MAGA  Kristi Noem is done in my mind  How can anybody shoot a healthy dog  I am so disappointed  Any thoughts?"In a re-post of The Guardian's article, Noem posted the following on X Friday morning: "We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm  Sadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years "Noem, a close ally of Trump, is widely speculated to be a potential vice president pick for him  Trump previously indicated that the Republican governor was a possible choice in an interview with Fox News in February and said that Noem and six others were being considered as his potential running mate Noem, however, also told Fox News in February that she and Trump have "never had that conversation" about her potentially being his 2024 running mate Polymarket, an online prediction platform where users can place "yes" or "no" bets on the likelihood of world events, is currently giving Noem a 3 percent chance of potentially being the next Republican vice president after the report emerged On Friday, Noem was given a 5 percent chance of being selected as Trump's next running mate, down from 10 percent the previous day  On March 25, Polymarket was listing Noem as the second favorite with 9 percent chance, behind South Carolina Senator Tim Scott on 22 percent Link to Image
