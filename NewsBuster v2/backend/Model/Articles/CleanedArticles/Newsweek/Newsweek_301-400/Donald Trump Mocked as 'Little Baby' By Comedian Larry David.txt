Comedian Larry David has mocked former President Donald Trump as a "little baby" who "knows he lost" the 2020 presidential election but refuses to admit the truth David, the Seinfeld co-creator who is currently starring in the final season of HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm, accused Trump of throwing "250 years of democracy out the window" because he won't admit his failure in a recent interview with CNN's Chris Wallace  Trump continues to falsely claim that the 2020 election was "stolen" by President Joe Biden Curb Your Enthusiasm's current season features a plotline involving David—playing an exaggerated version of himself—getting arrested and charged with a crime after offering water to a woman waiting on line to vote in Georgia, a reference to a real law that Peach State lawmakers passed months after Trump's loss In a segment of the Wallace interview that aired on CNN Wednesday night, David was asked how "pissed off" he was about the aftermath of the election  He passionately responded by calling Trump a "sociopath" and claiming that he was unable to "go a day" without thinking about political fallout from 2020 "I mean, you can't go a day without thinking about what he's done to this country," David said  "Because he's such a little baby that he's thrown 250 years of democracy out the window by not accepting the results of an election  I mean, it's so crazy! He's such a sociopath! He's so insane! He just couldn't admit to losing ""And we know he lost," he continued  "He knows he lost  And look how he's fooled everybody  He's convinced all these people that he didn't lose  It's    He's such a sick man! He's so sick!"David then calmed down slightly to say in a deadpan manner, "Anyway, no it hasn't impacted me at all," prompting laughter from Wallace and himself Newsweek reached out via email on Wednesday to Trump's representatives for comment David has been open about his distaste for Trump's career in politics in the past, with the topic previously making at least one notable appearance during an earlier season of Curb Your Enthusiasm During the long-running show's Season 10 debut in 2020, David is shown wearing one of Trump's "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) hats in liberal Los Angeles as an effective tactic for avoiding unwanted social encounters, calling the hat "a great people repellant "Trump himself later shared a video clip from the episode on Twitter, the platform now known as X, captioning it "TOUGH GUYS FOR TRUMP!" In an interview with Vanity Fair, show producer Jeff Schaffer later called Trump "so stupid" for sharing the clip while apparently being unaware that he was being mocked Followers of Trump's MAGA movement have also lashed out at David over the years  Only last month, Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote on X that she had watched a recent Curb Your Enthusiasm episode and was outraged that it "made fun of our good new law" and "painted GA conservatives and Trump supporters as racists and red necks ""I watched this week's episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm and it was a glaring reminder of why most Georgian's resent Republicans in our state for inviting the nasty commies from California, the Hollywood elites, into our state by dishing out Hollywood tax credits," Greene wrote "We in Georgia are fed up with disgusting Hollywood and their disgusting values and elite judgement in our state that is trying to turn GA blue!" she added Link to Image
