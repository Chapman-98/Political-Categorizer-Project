Does who I choose to be have anything to do with it?" Obama said Obama said that her interest is in service and helping kids, adding that she does not have to be in office to do that "Politics is hard  And the people who get into it—it's just like marriage, it's just like kids—you've got to want it  It's got to be in your soul because it is so important  It is not in my soul  Service is in my soul  Helping people is in my soul  Working with kids? I will spend my lifetime trying to make kids feel seen and find their light  That I will do  I don't have to hold office to do that," Obama said Although she has denied the possibility of running for president, she previously signaled she's "terrified" about the potential outcome of the 2024 election Appearing on an episode of On Purpose with Jay Shetty podcast in January, Obama listed November's presidential contest among the fears that keep her awake at night "What's going to happen in this next election? I'm terrified about what could possibly happen because our leaders matter  Who we select, who speaks for us, who holds that bully pulpit, it affects us in ways sometimes I think people take for granted," she told Shetty "The fact that people think that government—'eh, does it really even do anything?'—and I'm like 'Oh my God, does government do everything for us, and we cannot take this democracy for granted ' And I worry sometimes that we do  Those are the things that keep me up," Obama continued This is not the first time Obama has had to dispel the speculation and has rebuffed any notion that she might run for office Prior to the 2020 election, the former first lady addressed rumors she would run for office "The reason why I don't want to run for president—and I can't speak for Oprah [Winfrey] —but my sense is that, first of all, you have to want the job," Obama told Today in 2018, referencing prior rumors that Winfrey was going to run in 2020 She said, "And you can't just say, 'Well, you're a woman, run ' We just can't find the women we like and ask them to do it, because there are millions of women who are inclined and do have the passion for politics "Link to Image
