Former U S  President Donald Trump will abandon Europe if reelected later this year, Chinese state media have suggested "Trump just stripped off the U S  naked and put it on the table  Given the selfish nature of the U S , the U S  would rather sacrifice the interests of its European allies to serve its own  Even some Europeans are well aware of this," wrote Wang Wenwen, editor at Chinese nationalist outlet Global Times, wrote in an op-ed The scrutiny of Trump's comments on Europe's security comes as the U S  presidential elections in November could transform the relationship between Washington and Brussels The political division on Capitol Hill over America's long-term strategy in the Russia-Ukraine war is being closely watched in China, with another Chinese expert saying U S  support for Europe could become worthless if Trump is reelected "Europe is both hateful and fearful of Trump because if he is reelected, the U S  protection, which is now fragile, would become an empty promise," Song Zhongping, a Chinese military affairs expert, toldGlobal Times Trump on Saturday said at a rally in Conway, South Carolina, that he wouldn't protect the European countries that don't pay their share of contribution to NATO  In 2014, NATOheads of states agreed to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) but many do not make this target "No, I would not protect you  In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want  You gotta pay  You gotta pay your bills," Trump told the rally "NATO was busted until I came along," Trump said Chinese state media also pointed out that Trump's reelection could mean Europe's role in global politics may be about to change "A potential return to Trump's policies represents a multifaceted challenge for Europe  It not only affects Europe's economy and security but also raises new questions about Europe's role and strategy in global politics," Wang wrote NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg responded to Trump's comments, emphasizing the need to ensure collective defense "Any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the U S , and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk," Stoltenberg said on Sunday On Wednesday, Stoltenberg praised the NATO allies for raising their defense spending, some of which are on their way to achieving the 2 percent target "That is another record number, and a six-fold increase from 2014 when only three allies met the target," Stoltenberg told reporters Link to Image
