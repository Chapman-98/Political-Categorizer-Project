In South Carolina this weekend, former ambassador Nikki Haley put up a brave fight, but ultimately lost her home state's primary by 20 points to Donald Trump  As the primary season unfolds, it's becoming clearer that there's more to Trump's lead than Republican voters' policy preferences As Haley distanced herself from Trump, he became openly hostile about her  But he wasn't not the only one  Whether they're obsessed with Trump or full of disdain for Haley—or perhaps a mix of both—many conservatives seem to be circling the wagons around the former president and pushing her out  They're nasty about it too  The process was uncomfortable and revealing Nikki Haley's treatment exposes one of the GOP's glaring contradictions  The party claims to be pro-woman, but only if she adheres to a specific lifestyle  What's more, it embraces a presidential candidate who treats women poorly  This primary season raises an important question: does the GOP hate women, or just Nikki Haley?Haley's candidacy showed real promise  Even though she has lagged behind Trump, she didn't flop either  Where Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis faltered, she rose a bit  This seems to have infuriated many conservatives  Across right-of-center media, headlines bashing Haley abound At the Daily Wire, Matt Walsh recently took to questioning whether Haley was ever teased for her brown skin  "The claim that she as someone who barely even qualifies as brown was teased on a daily basis her entire childhood because of her brownness is just impossible to believe  If it was true, I would say it's not the worst thing in the world," he said on his podcast  It's hard to see conservatives saying this about any of the male candidates The disdain conservatives exhibit for Nikki Haley is palpable  While the Houston Chronicle—Texas' largest newspaper, and hardly a conservative one—endorsed her for the GOP primary over Trump, the American Conservative slammed Haley's "desperate search for relevance "It's possible, of course, and many conservatives will argue, that they simply don't like Haley because they don't like her politics  They see her as a "neocon" or a RINO or whatever other label seems like a catchy smear  Or they might insist they just like Trump more, or that he has more of a shot at beating Biden But their level of vitriol and ongoing disdain for Haley suggests there could be more to it  Especially because, ironically, the same conservatives pummeling Haley for not being the right kind of conservative are also happily promoting Trump, a man who not only isn't very conservative himself In fact, the same people who seem to disdain Haley for being a strong female candidate—one who pairs success in politics with being a working wife and mother—shrug off the fact that a jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and ordered him to pay $83 3 million to E  Jean Carroll Many of the conservatives who promote Trump and can't stand Haley make clear they only respect women if they follow a traditional lifestyle that heralds marriage and motherhood above all else  Marriage and motherhood are good things, but make for narrow definitions of success in a world where many women enjoy working, motherhood, and marriage—or even none of the above—but still possess value and worth Recently on X, Matt Walsh and Megyn Kelly debated the confines of feminism and traditional gender roles  Walsh argued that if self-described feminists want one aspect of traditional life, like a man who pays for dinners out, they must also "accept the rest of it" and "be willing to   be traditionally feminine " Kelly—a wife, working mom, and media icon—disagreed and suggested men can be happy with a woman who doesn't fit traditional definitions of femininity While motherhood and marriage are incredible, not everyone fits into a single mold  Women who do not opt for conservatives' preferred lifestyle should be treated with dignity and respect  A party that doesn't get that principle, and that embraces a man who treats women poorly, won't win over more women Nikki Haley may not get the GOP nomination, but she's been successful in many other ways  One of those ways is how she exposed the GOP's narrow definitions of women's success as the party backed a candidate who treats women with disdain  For the Republican Party to succeed again, it needs to do a lot of things, and one of them is to reevaluate how it sees women Nicole Russell is a mother of four who has worked in Republican politics  Her writing has appeared in The Atlantic, The Daily Beast, and the Washington Examiner  She is an opinion columnist at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram The views expressed in this article are the writer's own Link to Image
