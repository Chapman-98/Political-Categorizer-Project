Katie Porter has claimed that California's Senate primary race was "rigged" after she lost a vote on Wednesday.Porter, a progressive Democrat, came third in the non-partisan primary, losing out to Adam Schiff, a centrist Democrat.In response to the results, she blamed billionaires for spending money on attack adverts against her.Writing on X, formerly Twitter, she said: "Thank you to everyone who supported our campaign and voted to shake up the status quo in Washington. Because of you, we had the establishment running scared â€” withstanding 3 to 1 in TV spending and an onslaught of billionaires spending millions to rig this election."I also want to thank every person who supported us over the past six years. It's clear Californians are hungry for leaders who break the mold, can't be bought, and push for accountability in government and across our economy. And that's exactly what we as Americans deserve."Special interests like politics as it is today because they control the politicians. As we've seen in this campaign, they spend millions to defeat someone who will dilute their influence and disrupt the status quo. But take my word for it: I'll never stop fighting for you."This is a breaking story. More to follow.Link to Image
