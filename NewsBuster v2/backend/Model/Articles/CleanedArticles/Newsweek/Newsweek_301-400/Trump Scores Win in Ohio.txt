Donald Trump's choice for the Republican Senate primary race in Ohio was victorious on Tuesday, marking another win for the former president in the Buckeye State Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland businessman and political newcomer, beat out GOP state Senator Matt Dolan and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, advancing to face incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, in November Moreno had earned endorsements from several political heads aligned with Trump's Make American Great Again (MAGA) movement, including Ohio Senator J D  Vance, who in 2022 rode Trump's endorsement to the U S  Senate as a political outsider  Dolan, Moreno's top competitor, was backed by several established Republicans in the state, including Governor Mike DeWine and former Senator Rob Portman "I'm so grateful for the resounding support of Ohioans in all 88 counties," Moreno wrote in a post to X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday evening  "I thank Matt Dolan and Frank LaRose for a spirited primary contest  I look forward to uniting our party and working to send Sherrod Brown packing in November!"Once viewed as a swing state during the 2000s and 2010s, Ohio has recently looked far less competitive in major elections  Trump won the state over President Joe Biden by a roughly 8 percent margin in 2020—a larger lead than he held in Texas and Florida that year The former president also beat out former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Ohio by 8 points in 2016, and earned nearly 80 percent of the vote in the state's presidential primary on Tuesday Brown is the only Democratic candidate to win a statewide Ohio election since 2012 The political field may be shifting in the state once again, however, after Ohioans voted to enshrine abortion protections into the state's constitution in November, a consistent winning issue for Democrats since the U S  Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v  Wade in June 2022  Voters also passed a measure to legalize recreational marijuana  DeWine and other Ohio Republicans were critical of both measures leading up to the election Ohio's Senate race could give Republicans a chance to take control of Congress' upper chamber in November  Only one other Senate seat, in Montana, is up for grabs this fall where a Democratic incumbent is running for reelection in a state that Trump won in 2020 Several Republicans congratulated Moreno on Tuesday evening, including Vance, who said that the businessman was "pretty good at winning ""I'm not a pundit, but if you take a guy who gets outspent massively, earns the most important endorsement in politics, and then radically outperforms even the most positive polls, then I'd say he's pretty good at winning votes," Vance wrote on X  "Congrats to Bernie  On to November!"Former Republican gubernatorial candidate and Trump ally Kari Lake, who is running for U S  Senate in Arizona, wrote on X that she endorsed Moreno "because he is a man of integrity & he works harder than just about anyone I know ""Well done, my friend! I cannot wait to serve alongside you in the United States Senate," Lake added Congressman Byron Donalds, a MAGA Republican from Florida, also celebrated Moreno's win, writing in a post to X that the "road to a Republican Senate Majority runs through Ohio "Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment Tuesday night Link to Image
