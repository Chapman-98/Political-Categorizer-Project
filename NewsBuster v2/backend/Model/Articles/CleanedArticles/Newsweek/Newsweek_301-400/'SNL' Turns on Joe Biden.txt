Saturday Night Live has taken a break from bashing Donald Trump to hit out at Joe Biden The sketch show parodied Inside Politics for Saturday night's cold open, poking fun at the 81-year-old's age Dressed as Inside Politics co-anchor Dana Bash, SNL comedian Heidi Gardner began by addressing Biden's recent win in the Michigan primary, despite voters and media organizations questioning whether the president is "too old" for government "A New York Times poll has him down five points, and many voters still have concerns about his age," the faux Bash said, before handing over to Michael Longfellow, outfitted as governor of California and Biden advocate Gavin Newsom "I understand people care about the president's age, but they should look at his record," said the fake Newsom, defending the politician  "He's created more jobs than any president in history, inflation is down, the shamrock shake is back and Beyoncé has gone country "When asked if Biden could do all those things with the "speed and sharpness" of a younger man, Newsom replied: "He can do it better ""I'm a little skeptical," Bash continued  "This is the same man people call 'Sleepy Joe '""He's lightning quick," Newsom claimed  "The other day he was taking a nap and I whipped a baseball at him and he caught it like De Niro in Awakenings "Robert De Niro starred as a catatonic man in the 1990 drama, who cannot move but can respond to certain stimuli, such as catching a ball After doing an impression of De Niro, Newsom suggested that Bash "ask any of the people who are with him every day "Dana did just that, quizzing Ego Nwodim as White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who described Biden as "the most vigorous man she's ever known ""Behind closed doors, he's a whirlwind," Jean-Pierre said, reading out Biden's daily schedule of soul cycle classes, speed chess in the park, push-up contests and a lunch with "five raw chickens and a whole potato "Unconvinced, Dana asks Jean-Pierre: "Biden is 81, is that a little concerning?""Only if you're scared of wisdom," she replies  "Biden was 30-years-old when Roe v  Wade was instated, so you know he was smashing "Bash then moved onto to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, played by Marcello Hernández "I'm exhausted," Mayorkas told Bash, chuckling  "I was with Joe Biden all weekend and he wiped me out "Behind closed doors he's a dynamo  We went down the border town of Brownsville, Texas, and Joe went to beast mode ""He said: 'We gotta tighten this border, look how easily I can cross it,'" Mayorkas continued  "He parqueted up to the top of the border wall, front-flipped into the Rio Grande and came back up with a fish in his mouth "Mayorkas accused Bash of not reporting on their weekend adventure due to media bias, telling her: "It doesn't fit your narrative ""With all due respect, it doesn't fit reality," Bash replied, before talking with basketball star Draymond Green, played by Devon Walker "[Biden] got that dog in him," Green said, claiming the Democrat "dunked" on him "He dunked on you?" Bash asked, incredulous "Yeah it was disrespectful too," Green continued  "He windmilled in my face "I wasn't having it, so I tried to punch him in the nuts and broke three fingers," Walker added  "You can't mess with Joe man "Concluding the segment, Bash told Newsom that he didn't have to "exagerate to make voters feel better "In response, Newsom suggests the journalist FaceTime Biden, played by Mikey Day "Hey it's Gavin Newsom," Biden yells  "Hold on, I'm just going to turn up the volume "Biden then accidentally closes the call while attempting to find the volume button Newsweek has reached out to Joe Biden and NBC for comment A new poll conducted by the New York Times found that three out of five voters who backed Biden in 2020 now think he is too old to be president  However, Biden is still the favorite to land the 2024 Democrat nomination ahead of this year's general election He will likely be facing off against Donald Trump once again, with the 77-year-old the frontrunner in the Republican presidential primaries Link to Image
