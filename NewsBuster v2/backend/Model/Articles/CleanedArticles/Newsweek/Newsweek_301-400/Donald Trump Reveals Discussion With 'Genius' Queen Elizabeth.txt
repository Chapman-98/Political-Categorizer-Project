Donald Trump has revealed Queen Elizabeth II's "genius" trick for keeping herself out of politics, which he experienced during a private meeting The former President told British channel GB News in an interview broadcast on March 19 that the late monarch had "almost never made a mistake," in her 70 years on the throne And he cited the example of a conversation in which she refused to reveal any favorite prime minister or president, despite persistent questioning It came in the same interview that he took a swipe at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, suggesting they broke the queen's heart Trump said in his interview with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage: "When I was with her (the queen) and it turned out to be a real relationship, somehow we just got along, and she said it to people and I say it to people, but I said, 'who is your favorite prime minister?'"'Oh, I like them all, they were all wonderful weren't they?'" Trump continued "'Well, yeah, but did you like Winston Churchill the best?' 'Oh, he was lovely, no but I liked every one of them  I liked them all '"And I couldn't get her to say one, I couldn't do it, I tried  And then I said, 'Who was your favorite president?' Trump said  "'Honestly, I liked them all so much, they were all so wonderful ' 'But didn't you like Ronald Reagan the best?'"'No, I thought he was wonderful, but I liked them all  I got along with everyone ' And I realized this was genius because I don't walk out saying, 'She liked this one, she liked that one '"She liked them all  She was unbelievable and when you see the people, the lightweights we have to watch today and nowadays like our President [Joe Biden]  He goes every day, he can't speak  She went through years and years, decades and decades "Trump also took a swipe at Harry and Meghan, saying: "I would say, although she wouldn't show it because she was strong and smart, but I would imagine they broke her heart ""The things that they were saying were so bad and so horrible, and she was in her 90s hearing this stuff," Trump said  "I think they broke her heart "Trump has repeatedly taken a swipe at Harry and Meghan over the years, while seeking to present himself as close to the queen His reputation with the royals is somewhat more complicated than that, however, dating back to remarks he previously made about Princess Diana Christopher Andersen wrote in The King: The Life of Charles III: "It didn't help that Trump had aggressively pursued Princess Diana after her divorce—overtures that were rebuffed—and claimed later on a radio program that he could have 'nailed her if I wanted to,' but only if she passed an HIV test "Later, Trump commented on social media on topless pictures taken of Kate Middleton by the French paparazzi: "Kate Middleton is great—but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude—only herself to blame "Andersen wrote: "Trump's criticism of Kate resulted in what one Clarence House butler referred to as 'torrents of profanity' from both Prince Charles and his sons "Jack Royston is Newsweek's chief royal correspondent based in London  You can find him on X, formerly Twitter, at @jack_royston and read his stories on Newsweek'sThe Royals Facebook page Do you have a question about King Charles III, William and Kate, Meghan and Harry, or their family that you would like our experienced royal correspondents to answer?
