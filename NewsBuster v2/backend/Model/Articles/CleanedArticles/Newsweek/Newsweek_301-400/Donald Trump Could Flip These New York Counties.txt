Former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden won their respective primaries in New York on Tuesday, and while neither outcome was a surprise, early voting data offered a roadmap for Trump's campaign, highlighting which counties he's most likely to flip red in November.New York was one of four states that held their primary elections on Tuesday. Trump and Biden easily won their races, but data from a handful of New York counties suggest that Trump could make gains in a state that has long been a Democratic stronghold."Trump has a chance to flip these counties because, historically, these were counties that voted Republican," Jeffrey Kraus, a politics professor at Wagner College, told Newsweek on Wednesday.Kraus said that while Democrats traditionally focused on New York City and upstate cities like Albany, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, they have also started targeting northern suburbs in the last 20 yearsâ€”a strategy that has "been enough to ensure Democratic victories" in nearly all statewide contests.Two of the 21 counties that Biden won in the last presidential election now lean Republican, according to state voting registration data. Essex and Saratoga counties, where Biden saw his third- and fourth-narrowest margins of victory in 2020, have more registered Republicans than Democrats, as of February 27.Essex CountyThere are now 2,857 more registered Republicans than Democrats in Essex County. In 2020, Biden carried the county with 51.6 percent of the vote, receiving just 971 more votes than Trump.Trump and Biden saw practically the same amount of support on Tuesday in the northeastern county, with the former president winning just one more primary vote than Biden.Trump won just under 74 percent of the Republican vote on Tuesday, while Biden carried more than 90 percent of the Democratic vote. So, the presumptive GOP nominee will also likely see a boost in the general election when he's the only Republican on the ballot.Saratoga CountyFour years ago, Biden carried Saratoga County by just over 7,000 votes. But state data shows that there are over 10,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats in upstate's fastest-growing county.There was slightly higher support for Trump than Biden in the state's primary, with Trump earning some 200 more GOP votes than Biden won Democratic votes. And again, Trump had been backed by only 77 percent of Republicans in the county, while Biden was supported by 93 percent of Democrats, meaning Trump's advantage will likely grow in November.Broome CountyAlthough Broome County still trends Democratic, with some 1,700 more registered Democrats than Republicans, Trump saw nearly 300 more primary votes than Biden on Tuesday.Early data suggests that the general election will be just as tight. Trump won nearly 80 percent of the Republican vote while Biden took home 83 percent of the Democratic vote, signaling that neither candidate will likely see a massive surge in the general election.Broome County is where Biden saw his second-narrowest margin of victory in New York in 2020. He carried the county, which sits above Pennsylvania, with 50.7 percent of the vote. The president won with about 3,200 more votes than Trump, meaning he'll likely need to strengthen his support here, where the number of registered Democrats is half of his 2020 advantage.Clinton CountyBiden won Clinton County with 51.8 percent of the vote in 2020, securing just under 2,000 more votes than Trump. His slim margin of victory could spell trouble since there are only 1,395 more registered Democrats than Republicans, according to the state's most recent voter registration data.The president raked in some 200 more votes than Trump on Tuesday, but the close numbers suggest Trump has a chance of flipping the most northeastern corner of the state.Nassau CountyTrump still has ways to go before taking Nassau County, but his popularity in a county that borders New York City shows how one of the most Democratic centers of the nation is changing.Although Nassau County, the sixth-most populous county in the state, was one of the 21 counties that Biden won in the last presidential election, Republicans have been making steady gains in Nassau County since Biden's 2020 victory. Biden may have carried the Long Island county with 54.5 percent of the vote, but two years later, New York's 3rd Congressional District, which includes parts of Nassau County, went to Republican George Santos by 8 points in the 2022 midterms.Democrats still outnumber Republicans in the county by some 83,000 registered voters, but Trump was able to get a sizable number of voters to the polls on Tuesday.The former president was about 1,100 primary votes behind and had 85 percent of the GOP vote compared to Biden's domineering 93 percent of the Democratic vote. It's yet another sign that Trump could catch up in the county, where 13,549 Republicans and 13,557 Democrats voted on Tuesday.Link to Image
