Donald Trump lashed out at Republicans and "foolish" Mazi Melesa Pilip after she lost the special election in New York's 3rd Congressional District to Democrat Tom Suozzi Suozzi defeated Pilip on Tuesday night to take the seat that was left vacant when the disgraced former GOP Representative George Santos was expelled from Congress after he was charged with multiple fraud offences The defeat means that the GOP's already slim majority in the House has been reduced even further, as well as giving a boost to the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden heading into November's general election In a post on Truth Social, Trump suggested that Pilip, a registered Democrat who holds office as a Republican, lost the election because she did seek the backing of the former president "Republicans just don't learn, but maybe she was still a Democrat? I have an almost 99% Endorsement Success Rate in Primaries, and a very good number in the General Elections, as well, but just watched this very foolish woman, Mazi Melesa Pilip, running in a race where she didn't endorse me and tried to 'straddle the fence,' when she would have easily WON if she understood anything about MODERN DAY politics in America," Trump wrote "MAGA, WHICH IS MOST OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, STAYED HOME - AND IT ALWAYS WILL, UNLESS IT IS TREATED WITH THE RESPECT THAT IT DESERVES  I STAYED OUT OF THE RACE, "I WANT TO BE LOVED!" GIVE US A REAL CANDIDATE IN THE DISTRICT FOR NOVEMBER  SUOZZI, I KNOW HIM WELL, CAN BE EASILY BEATEN!"This is a breaking news story and will be updated as more information becomes available Link to Image
