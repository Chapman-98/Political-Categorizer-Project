In U S  foreign policy, President Joe Biden's Middle East strategy remains a beacon of diplomacy, dialogue, and unwavering commitment to Israel  Recent events, like the airstrikes in Yemen, prompt a crucial reexamination of his approach and Congress' role  This underscores the necessity for transparency and accountability in navigating complex challenges, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, South Africa's U N  actions, and Houthi attacks in the Red Sea Recent U S  and U K  airstrikes against Houthi targets extend beyond addressing shipping attacks, marking a perceived unjust aggression by an Iran-funded group  This shift alters Biden's once pragmatic approach, prompting a firm response  Congress, led by Biden, must actively engage in decision-making among allies in the region and amid airstrikes in Yemen  These events prompt vital dialogue, emphasizing the need for a thoughtful approach to shape America's vision for the Middle East, considering enduring conflicts and geopolitical challenges  Achieving balance requires Congress' active involvement in understanding military action implications The Houthis' defiance goes beyond mere bluster, showcasing resilience despite being targets of a lengthy Saudi-led bombing campaign  The recent attack serves to enhance their status among Iranian-backed groups and those seeking resistance to Israel's military campaign in Gaza  This adds complexity to the situation, underscoring the nuanced dynamics at play in the region  The commercial and shipping dimension is just one facet; the geopolitical implications and the Houthis' ability to absorb strikes contribute to the intricate landscape of Middle East politics So, Biden must adjust his foreign policy, especially as the 2024 election gains crucial significance  A Donald Trump victory could pose the risk of a more ideological and potentially violent approach to the Middle East, potentially compromising Biden's pragmatic diplomatic approach undertaken since the Oct  7 Hamas attack on Israel  Additionally, recent college campus pro-Palestine protests introduce an intermestic dimension, injecting politics into the topic among Democrats and Republicans and shaping perspectives in the domestic political landscape Moreover, Biden's pragmatic diplomatic approach goes along with electoral politics  With the U S  having the second-largest Jewish community globally, estimated at 6 3 million people, 61 percent of Jewish American voters support the two-state solution  Yet, Pew Research found that Americans (65 percent) say Hamas bears a lot of responsibility for the current conflict than the Israeli government (35 percent) The Biden administration must put more pressure on Israel to end the Gaza conflict, opposing settlement activity and annexation that undermine a two-state solution  The White House emphasizes that Jerusalem is still on the table, affirming a commitment to seeking a peaceful resolution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  This underscores Biden's pragmatic approach, prioritizing diplomatic solutions over ideological considerations Specifically, Congress must play a crucial role in helping the administration address human rights violations and foster transparency, especially in its engagements with key regional players like Egypt and Saudi Arabia  Recent corruption charges against Senator Bob Menendez pose challenges in maintaining diplomatic ties with Egypt  The longstanding support for Cairo's military regime, despite human rights concerns, is jeopardized by bribery allegations involving the influential senator  In addition, the transparency report led by Representative Jaime Raskin (D-Md ) in the House revealed financial dealings between Saudi Arabia and the Trump corporation, benefiting the former president with over $615,000 that was spent at the Trump World Tower and Trump International Hotel during his presidency  While these revelations further complicate U S  foreign relations in the Middle East, they also make it clear what regional partners are doing and how they are engaging with the U S  on both sides of the aisle Furthermore, the recent South Africa case in The Hague adds another layer to the human rights discussion  South Africa argues that, as a party to the Genocide Convention, it has an interest in preventing genocide and ensuring that any commission of genocide (or failure to prevent it) does not go forward with impunity  Essentially, this revolves around a peremptory norm of international law, specifically the prohibition on genocide, and the obligations of states generally to ensure its adherence  While, Israel is likely to present counter arguments, challenging South Africa's stance in this legal context has become an ethical question too for many not only in The Hague but also in the United State for its 2024 electorate Biden's Middle East policy is more pragmatic than an ideological Trump presidency would beâ€”standing as a beacon of diplomacy, dialogue, and unwavering commitment to Israel  Recent events and legal complexities shape this recalibration, emphasizing the need for thoughtful solutions and the crucial role of Congress  As Biden navigates these challenges, he must emphasize the opportunity to fortify a commitment to just and equitable engagement in the Middle East, while highlighting the potential risks associated with an alternative leadership approach Heidi Jane Smith, PhD, is a Democratic analyst and professor at Universidad Iberoamericana Mexico City The views expressed in this article are the writer's own Link to Image
