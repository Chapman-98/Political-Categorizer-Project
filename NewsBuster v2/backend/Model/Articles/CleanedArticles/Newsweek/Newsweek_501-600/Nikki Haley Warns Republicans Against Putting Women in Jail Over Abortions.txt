Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley warned on Monday that Republicans should avoid legislation that seeks to jail women who have abortions."Can't we agree that no state law should say to a woman that if she has an abortion she's going to jail or get the death penalty, let's just start there," Haley said at a Pints & Politics event in Charleston, South Carolina. "I will not be a part of demonizing this issue."Haley said that she is "unapologetically pro-life" because her husband was adopted and she had trouble with the births of her children."I mean, no offense, but the fellas don't know how to talk about this, and they just don't....The issue of abortion is incredibly personal to every woman and every man, and it requires respect," Haley said.The contextSince the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right for women to receive an abortion, it has remained a hot topic, and candidates like Haley, former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden have offered somewhat different stances.After Roe v. Wade was overturned, many Republican-led states had "trigger laws" in place that immediately banned abortions.What we knowLast year, CNN reported that Louisiana state Representative Danny McCormick proposed legislation that sought to criminalize abortions, giving women who receive them jail time.While speaking with CBS' Face the Nation last month, Haley was asked about her stance on abortion and said, "Yes, I'm unapologetically pro-life."She added that she was "fine" with a federal law banning abortions."I've said I'm fine with a federal law. But the thing is, in order to get a federal law, you have to have a majority of the House, 60 senators and a signature of the president," Haley said.Newsweek reached out to Haley's press office via email for comment.Update 2/5/24, 12:48 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with further information and to reflect that Newsweek reached out to Haley's press office for comment.
