A surprise new contender for a potential running mate for Donald Trump has emerged after the former president said Texas Governor Greg Abbott is someone he would consider.Abbott is a "spectacular man," according to Trump in a conversation with Fox News host Sean Hannity. Trump, the likely Republican presidential candidate according to the polls, said during a visit to the southern border that the Texas governor is "absolutely" on his vice presidential shortlist.Abbott is a "spectacular man," Trump added to Hannity and "certainly he would be somebody that I would very much consider."Newsweek has approached spokesperson for Trump and Abbott for comment via email.The former president visited the border at Eagle Pass, Texas, on Thursday along with Abbott.Eagle Pass is a key area of contention after a Supreme Court ruling in January said federal agents could cut razor wire. The Biden adminstration argued it prevented them from accessing important parts of the border.Since, Texas has blocked federal agents from entering, putting the state directly at odds on the border issue with Trump's political foe President Joe Biden.Biden also visited Texas this week, where he called on Trump to "join"him in an effort to pass the bipartisan border bill that stalled in Congress after the latter urged Republicans to block it."Instead of playing politics with this issue, instead of telling members of Congress to block this legislation, join me," Biden said.Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the offer, telling Newsweek a "Biden Migrant Crisis has led to deaths."On March 1, the U.K.-based betting comparison website Oddschecker had not listed Abbott as a potential candidate for Trump's list.Newsweek has approached the White House for further comment via email.Trump's Seven Possible Running MatesAbbott is now the seventh name Trump has touted as a possible running mate.Trump previously said at least six names are on his list including Senator Tim Scott, Governors Ron DeSantis and Kristi Noem, previous Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswarmy, Representative Byron Donalds and former member of the House Tulsi Gabbard.On March 1, U.K.-based bookmakers Betfair listed Noem as the favorite at 22-5. A $10 bet on odds of 9-2 would return $54 including the original stake.Betfair's odds on the six potential candidates named by Trump are:Kristi Noem – 9-2Vivek Ramaswarmy – 15-2Tim Scott – 7-1Tulsi Gabbard – between 13/1 and 14/1Byron Donalds – 35-1Ron DeSantis – 64-1Trump confirmed each of the six are on his shortlist during a Fox News town hall earlier this month. The six were suggested by host Laura Ingraham based on audience suggestions."They're all good, they're all solid," Trump said. The former president added he would look for a running mate "with common sense, because there's so many things happening in this country that don't make sense."He singled out Scott, however, saying the senator who was in the room at the time "has been much better for me than he was for himself."At the time of writing, Abbott is still listed on Betfair with an outsiders chance of 69/1. He is behind New York Representative Elise Stefanik and former Housing Secretary Ben Carson who are on 10-1 and 13-1 respectively.Previously, Betfair spokesperson Sam Rosbottom said after Trump confirmed the initial six names on his shortlist that "the race to be on the Republican ticket as VP is a lot tighter than the race to bethe presidential candidate."He added: "There are a whole host of names that punters are backing, including previous runners in the Republican nominee race."Rosbottom said Friday that "If Trump has mentioned him, and he gains some momentum, it wouldn't be a surprise if [Abbott's] odds shorten with punters."Link to Image
