Royce White, the GOP-endorsed Senate candidate for Minnesota, appears to be a little sensitive to reports about his string of missteps  After The Daily Beast reported on Wednesday that White had confused a map of Minneapolis’ drinking fountains for a map of crime stats, he argued that one of his testicles garners more “media attention” than The Daily Beast  “It’s been a great couple of weeks,” he insisted on X  “The msm [mainstream media] blinks every time I take a leak!
